As in the recent years, I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the fourth stop on our tour of sales meeting with our independent in more than 20 states. 
Meeting annually with Asians is essential to our relationship-oriented agency-centered strategy. We also enjoy this part of our job and find it energizing. 
It's important to sincerely thank our agents in person for contributing to another year of underwriting profit in premium growth and for trusting Cincinnati Financial as we earn the opportunity to serve the people and businesses and their communities. 
Turning to our financial performance. We feel good about the strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the year 2014. They continue to reflects steady execution in our underwriting and pricing. We had our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth, and rising valuations and equity security markets helped us book value for your company. Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with an improved expense ratio, led to the fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio of 90.4%, lowering the full year ratio to 95.6%. 
We are further segmenting our book of business using pricing precision and reselection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on policy by policy basis. That's an ongoing focus as we seek to further improve underwriting results. We think those actions will continue to provide benefits over time as we aim for a combined ratio below 95% in 2015. 
Working with our agents, we benefit from the local presence of our field underwriters who make those decisions for all of our commercial new business. Their decisions are formed by analytics and risk inspection data from our ongoing loss control program. We are pleased that 2014 was another year in which we met our premium growth objective of outpacing industry growth, thanks to strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing. Growth we reported for the fourth quarter reflected the favorable offsetting effect of the same factor that slow growth reported fourth quarter last year, the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline -- I mean, last quarter. Reported last quarter. The 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline. As we noted several times before, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth. Part of our long-term strategy is the agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve established agency drillships and the franchise value they enjoy. 
In 2014, we appointed 99 new independent agencies and plan to appoint about 100 more in 2015. Our agency partners do a great job helping us retain profitable accounts. Also retention from both Commercial and Personal Lines was generally consistent with the year ago. Our Commercial Lines policy retention continues to move the high-end of the mid-80% range and Personal Lines policy retention continues in a low- to mid-90% range. We continue to work hard to earn new business through our agencies. New products and services, such as expanding programs offered to our target markets department, are an important part of growing new business. 
We're also excited by new business opportunities we'll see by expanding our current proxy services aimed at high net worth policy holders in our Personal Lines insurance segment. You'll hear more about that over the next few quarters as we march towards a longer-term goal of $2 billion in annual Personal Lines segment premiums. 
Although our new business volume was down from 2013, we new business premiums based the record levels for us, our agency still produced over $1.5 billion in new business premiums in 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines remained in the low-single digit rents, a lower than in the third quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the fourth quarter. For smaller commercial property and commercial auto policies that renewed during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced increases averaging in the high-single-digit range, and commercial auto average increases in the mid-single-digit range. 
For our Personal Lines policies, renewal price increases averaged near the high-end of the low-single digit range. For excess of Surplus Lines segment, the fourth quarter 2014 average renewal price increases continued in the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business hit a home run in 2014 with a combined ratio below 80% and net written premiums up 20%. Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, produced another quarter of steady earnings, and again, grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance. 
January 1 marked the renewal of our primary property casualty reinsurance treaties. Our first press release terms for 2015 are similar to last year except for increase in our retention by $2 million to $10 million for loss. That change in more favorable rates should result in approximately $21 million less in reinsurance cost for this treaties compared with 2014. 
Our property catastrophe treaty also has terms similar to last year, except for increase in our retention by $25 million to $100 million per event. We expect our season premiums for that treaty to be approximately $8 million less than last year. 
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio ended 2014 at 12.6%. That result was towards the high-end of our target, which is an annual ratio averaging 10% to 13%. While a healthy stock market contributed, majority of the 12.6% was due to the contribution of operating income. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to add his insights about our recent financial performance."
260681,281275099,755540,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Stephen. Thanks for all of you who are joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results.

Thanks for all of you who are joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy . dividend income from our stock portfolio rose 6% for the quarter and 13% for the year. In our quarter portfolio of 50 common stocks, all 50 improved their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period ending December 2014 with a median increase of 8.3%. 
Similar to others in our industry, yields per bond portfolio continued to decline. The fourth quarter 2014 pretax average yield reported a 4.72%, with 15 basis points lower than a year ago, while that measure on a full year was 14 basis lower. Taxable bonds representing nearly 70% of our bond portfolio had a pretax yield of approximately 5.25% at the end of the fourth quarter 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was 4.49%. For the same period, our tax exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.78%, and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.26%. 
Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained at the same level as 1 quarter ago at 4.4 years. Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2014 were up 10% to $873 million, contributing to $324 million of net purchases of securities for investment portfolio. 
Careful expense management continues to be a priority and together, the premium growth contributed to a 1.3 points of improvement to a full year 2014 underwriting expense ratio. 
we'd like to analyze the underwriting expense ratios 2 components, commissions and noncommission expenses. The commission components tend to variability with underwriting proceed. They also considers 3-year profitability by agency. So if the commissions would arise, it should be more than offset by a lower loss ratio. The noncommission coupons test the various a result of investments we make in the property casualty business, such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise. Again, we believe that it would be worth the trade-off of a short-term increase in net component to create overall value for investors and others. We plan to continue to have noncommission expense dollar volume grow more slowly to premium volume, producing a favorable effect on the noncommissioned expense ratio. 
Next, let's turn to loss reserves that, deficits that we follow a consistent approach and that we've experienced 26 years -- consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. We continue to aim for a reserve reported at our balance sheet, to be at levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuary estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
Our news release reported higher reserve estimates for our commercial casualty line of business. That translated in 2014 to a lower amount of total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years, although in aggregate, our other lines of businesses were slightly more favorable than in 2013. Once we completed all of our year-end reporting, you'll be able to further analyze the details. For now, I'll highlight a few important items. Our longtime, we disclosed historical paid loss patterns our are key assumptions used to make projections necessary for [indiscernible] reserves. During 2014, paid losses for commercial casualty, especially related to a few umbrella liability claims, emerged at levels higher than we expected, particularly for accident years 2005 and 2007. Considering that new data, we estimated the commercial casualty reserves for subsequent accident years leveraged more or less to be adequate compared with the recent past quarters. Overall, our full year 2014 net favorable development was as usual spread over several accident years, including 58% for accident year 2013, 15% for accident year 2012, 17% for accident year 2011 and 10% for all older accident years in aggregate. The capital liquidity position in the company growth that both strength and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company, nearly $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, was up 16% for the year, property casualty premium surplus ratio at 0.9:1 continues to provide capital that adequately support our plans for growing growth of insurance operations. We did not purchase additional shares during the full fourth quarter. 
Full year 2014 share repurchases totaled 450,000 shares at an average price per share of $46.63. 
I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.40. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.06. The changes in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.77, and we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.13 during the fourth quarter to a record high of $40.14 per share. 
Now with that, for the call back over to Steve."

We had a significant year in 2013 there and it's -- that was in the area of larger workers comp. It's an area that we are conservative on. Very pleased with the progress making on the loss for a lot of reasons, but we just simply did not write as many larger workers comp claims, and that content to have a slightly muting effect on overall package business because typically, our agents like to put the workers comp with the package. So I chalked that up to conservatism on that particular line of business. Maybe overly conservative, I suppose, but that would've been a factor. The other factor that occurred and really started occurring really maybe in the second quarter, but clearly, I think most carriers are feeling they've reached pretty close to rate adequacy. And rather than signaling to their agents that they would be asking for and requiring fairly substantial rate increases at renewal, instead, they're defending the renewals more strongly. So the atmosphere we're competing in is one there aren't as many what I would consider to be good accounts or easier or more desirable accounts out in the marketplace. We still have our pipeline full, but segmentation is playing through for every carrier. And so the accounts that need the most rate or might have a more poor experience are the ones that are more likely out in the marketplace. So it's just tougher from that point. A few other things I will comment on and I don't know how to fix other carriers, but the M&A activity that's occurred over the last 3, 4 years. That's fairly disruptive at the agency level. If some producers leave, the acquirers change the appetite for some agencies. We react to that. In some cases, it works out favorably for us. And in some cases, the consequence might be that we would appoint more agencies, and that takes a little bit more time for things to gear out. So we're not pushing any panic buttons in terms of the fact the new business was down. issue access on Surplus Lines division continued strong. We think we have tremendous potential there. Personal Lines is stabilized, and we think that you'll see an increase in new business in 2015 there. So it's -- maybe a little worried but those are kind of observations that we have. It's very reenforcing to be out this week with our agencies and hear their opinions of the marketplace and their confidence in us. So we'll keep our pipeline full and we'll be good selectors of businesses as this year proceeds."

So -- and just general inspections of business.

We've gone through several years of rate increases. Pretty darn strong rate increases in the home area, and that's not as strong any longer, so the pressure is gone there. The issue is we've have a lot of feedback on that. Our agencie's right. Ballpark $2 billion in excess of Surplus Lines premium, and so we have tremendous opportunity to grow our company there. We gradually increased our appetite in that line of business, and so we're pleased to hear the news on that. Our target markets division has 17 program and that's going to expand. If there's anything, I guess, it's really created most of a wish list for discussion at our sales meeting would be that they would ask that we continue to grow that particular division. Every agency, every aggressive agency, I would say, is niching. They have producers that go after certain industry classes. And while it's not unusual for carriers to have that, what is a bit unusual from our standpoint is the fact that we have some managers in those areas. They'll go out and travel with agencies, go out and make sales calls with those agencies. So we may be we -- maybe we outworth the competition a little bit better in that category. So I would say those would be the major areas that we've improved. Loss control continues to be a benefit. Our agencies are good. We're taking our loss control rep, our claims rep. And our field underwriters are actually on the sales call and feedback we get on that is excellent. So no particular area. Cybers talked about a bit. It's a being talked about by everyone.

As in recent years, I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the fourth stop on our tour of sales meeting with our independent agents in more than 20 states.
Meeting annually with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented, agency-centered strategy. We also enjoy this part of our job and find it energizing.
It's important to sincerely thank our agents in person for contributing to another year of underwriting profit and premium growth and for trusting Cincinnati Insurance as we earn the opportunity to serve the people and businesses in their communities.
Turning to our financial performance. We feel good about the strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the year 2014. They continue to reflect steady execution in our underwriting and pricing. We had our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth, and rising valuations in equity security markets helped boost book value for your company. Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with an improved expense ratio, led to a fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio of 90.4%, lowering the full year ratio to 95.6%.
We are further segmenting our book of business using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. That's an ongoing focus as we seek to further improve underwriting results. We think those actions will continue to provide benefits over time as we aim for a combined ratio below 95% in 2015.
Working with our agents, we benefit from the local presence of our field underwriters who make those decisions for all of our commercial new business. Their decisions are formed by analytics and risk inspection data from our ongoing loss control program.
We're pleased that 2014 was another year in which we met our premium growth objective of outpacing industry growth, thanks to strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing. 
Growth we reported for the fourth quarter reflected the favorable offsetting effect of the same factor of the slow growth reported last year, the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline -- I mean, last quarter, reported last quarter of the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline.
As we noted several times before, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth. Part of our long-term strategy is deploying agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve established agency relationships and the franchise value they enjoy.
In 2014, we appointed 99 new independent agencies and plan to appoint about 100 more in 2015. Our agency partners do a great job helping us retain profitable accounts.
Policy retention from both Commercial and Personal Lines was generally consistent with the year ago. Our Commercial Lines policy retention continues near the high end of the mid-80% range, and Personal Lines policy retention continues in a low to mid-90% range.
We continue to work hard to earn new business through our agencies. New products and services, such as expanding programs offered through our Target Markets department, are an important part of growing new business.
We are also excited by new business opportunities we'll see by expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policyholders and -- through our Personal Lines insurance segment. You'll hear more about that over the next few quarters as we march towards a longer-term goal of $2 billion in the annual Personal Lines segment premiums.
Although our new business volume was down from 2013, the new business premiums reached a record level for us. Our agencies still produced over $1.5 billion in new business premiums in 2014.
For the fourth quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines remained in the low single-digit range, a little lower than in the third quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the fourth quarter.
For smaller commercial property and commercial auto policies that renewed during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced increases averaging in the high single-digit range, and commercial auto average increases in the mid-single-digit range.
For our Personal Lines policies, renewal price increases averaged near the high end of the low single-digit range. For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, the fourth quarter 2014 average renewal price increases continued in the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business hit a home run in 2014 with a combined ratio of below 80% and net written premiums up 20%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, produced another quarter of steady earnings and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.
January 1 marked the renewal of our primary property casualty reinsurance treaties. Our per-risk treaty's terms for 2015 are similar to last year, except for an increase in our retention by $2 million to $10 million per  loss. That change in more favorable rates should result in approximately $21 million less in reinsurance cost for those treaties compared with 2014.
Our property catastrophe treaty also has terms similar to last year, except for an increase in our retention by $25 million to $100 million per event. We expect our season premiums for that treaty to be approximately $8 million less than last year.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value-creation ratio, ended 2014 at 12.6%. That result was toward the high end of our target, which is an annual ratio averaging 10% to 13%. While a healthy stock market contributed, majority of the 12.6% was due to the contribution of operating income.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to add his insights about our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend incom",881,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend income from our stock portfolio rose 6% for the quarter and 13% for the year. At our core portfolio of 50 common stocks, all 50 improved their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period ending December 2014 with a median increase of 8.3%.
Similar to others in our industry, yields for our bond portfolio continued to decline. The fourth quarter 2014 pretax average yield, reported at 4.72%, was 13 basis points lower than a year ago, while that measure on a full year was 14 basis lower.
Taxable bonds, representing nearly 70% of our bond portfolio, had a pretax yield of approximately 5.25% at the end of the fourth quarter 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was 4.49%. For the same period, our tax-exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.78%, and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.26%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained at the same level as one quarter ago at 4.4 years.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2014 were up 10% to $873 million, contributing to $324 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Careful expense management continues to be a priority, and together with premium growth, contributed to a 1.3 points of improvement to our full year 2014 underwriting expense ratio. 
We like to analyze the underwriting expense ratio's 2 components: commissions and noncommission expenses. The commission components tend to vary with recent year underwriting profitability. They also consider its 3-year profitability by agency. So if the commission ratio would arise, it should be more than offset by a lower loss ratio. The noncommission component tends to vary as a result of investments we make in the property casualty business, such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise. Again, we believe it would be worth the trade-off of a short-term increase in that component to create overall value for investors and others. We plan to continue to have non-commission expense dollar volume grow more slowly to premium volume, producing a favorable effect on the non-commission expense ratio.
Next, let's turn to loss reserves. I'd like to emphasize that we follow a consistent approach in that we have experienced 26 years -- consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. We continue to aim for a reserve reported on our balance sheet to be at the levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuary estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.
Our news release reported higher reserve estimates for our commercial casualty line of business. That translated in 2014 to a lower amount of total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years, although, in aggregate, our other lines of businesses were slightly more favorable than in 2013. Once we complete all of our year-end reporting, we'll be able to further analyze the details.
For now, I'll highlight a few important items. For a long time, we disclosed the historical paid loss patterns or our key assumptions used to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves.
During 2014, paid losses for commercial casualty, especially related to a few umbrella liability claims, emerged at levels higher than we expected, particularly for accident years 2005 and 2007. Considering that new data, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for subsequent accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with the recent past quarters.
Overall, our full year 2014 net favorable development was, as usual, spread over several accident years, including 58% for accident year 2013; 15% for accident year 2012; 17% for accident year 2011; and 10% for all older accident years in aggregate.
The capital liquidity position of the company reflects both strength and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company, nearly $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, was up 16% for the year. Our property casualty premium to surplus ratio at 0.9:1 continues to provide capital that adequately supports our plans for ongoing growth of insurance operations. We did not purchase additional shares during the fourth quarter. Full year 2014 share repurchases totaled 450,000 shares at an average price per share of $46.63.
I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing our contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.40. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.06. The changes in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.77, and we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.13 during the fourth quarter to a record high of $40.14 per share.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

In closing our prepared remarks, I'll note that during the fourth quarter, Fitch Ratings and A.M. Best affirmed their strong ratings of our companies. We were especially pleased that, that announces positive outlook on the issuer credit rating of our newest company, the Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters.
Since its start-up in 2008, our Excess & Surplus Lines business has established a good track record, and we expect it to continue attracting more of our agents business. That's just one of many factors that give us confidence we can perform and benefit shareholders over the coming years. 
The board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by increasing the cash dividend to $0.46 per share. That action sets the stage for 55 consecutive years of dividend increases.
We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.
As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck.

We had a significant year in 2013 there, and it's -- that was in the area of larger workers' comp. It's an area that we are conservative on. Very pleased with the progress we're making on the loss for a lot of reasons. But we just simply did not write as many larger workers' comp claims, and that can tend to have a slightly muting effect on overall package business because typically, our agents like to put the workers' comp with the package. So I chalked that up to conservatism on that particular line of business. Maybe overly conservative, I suppose, but that would have been a factor. The other factor that occurred and really started occurring, I think, really and maybe in the second quarter. But clearly, I think most carriers are feeling they've reached pretty close to rate adequacy and rather than signaling to their agents that they would be asking for and requiring fairly substantial rate increases at renewal. Instead, they are defending the renewals more strongly. So the atmosphere we're competing in is one where there aren't as many what I would consider to be good accounts or easier or more desirable accounts out in the marketplace. We still have our pipeline full, but segmentation is playing through the -- for every carrier. And so the accounts that need the most rate or might have a more poor experience are the ones that are more likely out in the marketplace. So it's just tougher from that standpoint.
A few other things I would comment on, and I don't know how to fix other carriers, but the M&A activity that's occurred over the last 3, 4 years, that's fairly disruptive at the agency level. As some producers leave, the acquirers change the appetite for some agencies. We react to that. In some cases, it works out favorably for us. And in some cases, the consequence might be that we would appoint more agencies, and that takes a little bit more time for things to gear up. So we're not pushing any panic buttons in terms of the fact the new business was down. CSU, our Excess & Surplus Lines division, continued strong. We think we have tremendous potential there. Personal Lines is stabilized, and we think that you'll see an increase in new business in 2015 there. So it's -- maybe a little wordy, but those are kind of observations that we have. It's very reinforcing to be out this week with our agencies and hear their opinions of the marketplace and their confidence in us. So we'll keep our pipeline full, and we'll be good selectors of businesses through this year proceeds."

There will be -- the states are looking at principal base reserves. And when we get there, we think we can free up some of the capital at the -- in the life company. And if we had this principle base reserves today, I would suspect that our capital in the life company would be somewhere in the $350 million to $400 million range.

They're also pleased to hear that when it comes to middle-market Personal Lines, Will is reinforcing our activity there. They're pleased with the automation that we have there. We've gone through several years of rate increases, pretty darn strong rate increases in the homeowner area, and that's not as strong any longer, so the pressure is gone there. CSU is a -- we had a lot of feedback on that. Our agency is right, ballpark $2 billion in Excess & Surplus Lines premium, and so we have tremendous opportunity to grow our E&S company there. We gradually increased our appetite in that line of business, and so they're pleased to hear the news on that. Our Target Markets division has 17 programs, and that's going to expand. If there's anything, I guess, that's really created most of a wish list or a discussion at our sales meetings would be that they would ask that we continue to grow that particular division. Every agency, every aggressive agency, I would say, is niching. They have producers. They go after certain industry classes. And while it's not unusual for carriers to have that, what is a bit unusual from our standpoint is the fact that we have some managers in those areas, they'll go out and travel with agencies, go out and make sales calls with those agencies. So we -- maybe we outworth the competition a little bit better in that category. So I would say those would be the major areas that we've improved. Loss control continues to be a benefit. Our agencies are good. We're taking our loss control rep, our claims rep and our field underwriters are actually on the sales call, and feedback we get on that is excellent. So no particular area. Cyber is talked about a bit, it's being talked about by everyone, but that's on the radar screen for everyone as an emerging coverage that we're pleased to tell them we have some things in the works on."

As in recent years, I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the fourth stop on our tour of sales meeting with our independent agents in more than 20 states.
Meeting annually with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented, agency-centered strategy. We also enjoy this part of our job and find it energizing.
It's important to sincerely thank our agents in person for contributing to another year of underwriting profit and premium growth and for trusting Cincinnati Insurance as we earn the opportunity to serve the people and businesses in their communities.
Turning to our financial performance. We feel good about the strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the year 2014. They continue to reflect steady execution in our underwriting and pricing. We had our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth, and rising valuations in equity security markets helped boost book value for your company. Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with an improved expense ratio, led to a fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio of 90.4%, lowering the full year ratio to 95.6%.
We are further segmenting our book of business using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. That's an ongoing focus as we seek to further improve underwriting results. We think those actions will continue to provide benefits over time as we aim for a combined ratio below 95% in 2015.
Working with our agents, we benefit from the local presence of our field underwriters who make those decisions for all of our commercial new business. Their decisions are informed by analytics and risk inspection data from our ongoing loss control program.
We're pleased that 2014 was another year in which we met our premium growth objective of outpacing industry growth, thanks to strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing. 
Growth we reported for the fourth quarter reflected the favorable offsetting effect of the same factor of the slow growth reported last year, the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline -- I mean, last quarter, reported last quarter of the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline.
As we noted several times before, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth. Part of our long-term strategy is deploying agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve established agency relationships and the franchise value they enjoy.
In 2014, we appointed 99 new independent agencies and plan to appoint about 100 more in 2015. Our agency partners do a great job helping us retain profitable accounts.
Policy retention from both Commercial and Personal Lines was generally consistent with the year ago. Our Commercial Lines policy retention continues near the high end of the mid-80% range, and Personal Lines policy retention continues in a low to mid-90% range.
We continue to work hard to earn new business through our agencies. New products and services, such as expanding programs offered through our Target Markets department, are an important part of growing new business.
We are also excited by new business opportunities we'll see by expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policyholders and -- offered through our Personal Lines insurance segment. You'll hear more about that over the next few quarters as we march towards a longer-term goal of $2 billion in the Inter-Personal Lines segment premiums.
Although our new business volume was down from 2013, the new business premiums reached a record level for us. Our agencies still produced over $1.5 billion in new business premiums in 2014.
For the fourth quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines remained in the low single-digit range, a little lower than in the third quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the fourth quarter.
For smaller commercial property and commercial auto policies that renewed during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced increases averaging in the high single-digit range, and commercial auto average increases in the mid-single-digit range.
For our Personal Lines policies, renewal price increases averaged near the high end of the low single-digit range. For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, the fourth quarter 2014 average renewal price increases continued in the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business hit a home run in 2014 with a combined ratio of below 80% and net written premiums up 20%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, produced another quarter of steady earnings and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.
January 1 marked the renewal of our primary property casualty reinsurance treaties. Our per-risk treaty's terms for 2015 are similar to last year, except for an increase in our retention by $2 million to $10 million per  loss. That change in more favorable rates should result in approximately $21 million less in reinsurance cost for those treaties compared with 2014.
Our property catastrophe treaty also has terms similar to last year, except for an increase in our retention by $25 million to $100 million per event. We expect our season premiums for that treaty to be approximately $8 million less than last year.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value-creation ratio, ended 2014 at 12.6%. That result was toward the high end of our target, which is an annual ratio averaging 10% to 13%. While a healthy stock market contributed, majority of the 12.6% was due to the contribution of operating income.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to add his insights about our recent financial performance."
260681,281275099,756167,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend incom",881,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend income from our stock portfolio rose 6% for the quarter and 13% for the year. At our core portfolio of 50 common stocks, all 50 improved their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period ending December 2014 with a median increase of 8.3%.
Similar to others in our industry, yields for our bond portfolio continued to decline. The fourth quarter 2014 pretax average yield, reported at 4.72%, was 13 basis points lower than a year ago, while that measure on a full year was 14 basis lower.
Taxable bonds, representing nearly 70% of our bond portfolio, had a pretax yield of approximately 5.25% at the end of the fourth quarter 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was 4.49%. For the same period, our tax-exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.78%, and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.26%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained at the same level as one quarter ago at 4.4 years.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2014 were up 10% to $873 million, contributing to $324 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Careful expense management continues to be a priority, and together with premium growth, contributed to a 1.3% point of improvement to our full year 2014 underwriting expense ratio. 
We like to analyze the underwriting expense ratio's 2 components: commissions and noncommission expenses. The commission components tend to vary with recent year underwriting profitability. It also considers 3-year profitability by agency. So if the commission ratio were to rise, it should be more than offset by a lower loss ratio. The noncommission component tends to vary as a result of investments we make in the property casualty business, such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise. Again, we believe it would be worth the trade-off of a short-term increase in that component to create overall value for investors and others. We plan to continue to have non-commission expense dollar volume grow more slowly to premium volume, producing a favorable effect on the non-commission expense ratio.
Next, let's turn to loss reserves. I'd like to emphasize that we follow a consistent approach in that we have experienced 26 years -- consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. We continue to aim for a reserve reported on our balance sheet to be at the levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuary estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.
Our news release reported higher reserve estimates for our commercial casualty line of business. That translated in 2014 to a lower amount of total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years, although, in aggregate, our other lines of businesses were slightly more favorable than in 2013. Once we complete all of our year-end reporting, we'll be able to further analyze the details.
For now, I'll highlight a few important items. For a long time, we disclosed the historical paid loss patterns or our key assumptions used to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves.
During 2014, paid losses for commercial casualty, especially related to a few umbrella liability claims, emerged at levels higher than we expected, particularly for accident years 2005 and 2007. Considering that new data, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for subsequent accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with the recent past quarters.
Overall, our full year 2014 net favorable development was, as usual, spread over several accident years, including 58% for accident year 2013; 15% for accident year 2012; 17% for accident year 2011; and 10% for all older accident years in aggregate.
The capital liquidity position of the company reflects both strength and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company, nearly $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, was up 16% for the year. Our property casualty premium to surplus ratio at 0.9:1 continues to provide capital that adequately supports our plans for ongoing growth of insurance operations. We did not purchase additional shares during the fourth quarter. Full year 2014 share repurchases totaled 450,000 shares at an average price per share of $46.63.
I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing our contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.40. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.06. The changes in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.77, and we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.13 during the fourth quarter to a record high of $40.14 per share.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

As we looked at 2005, 2007, the largest, as Mike just mentioned, was one claim in 2005, one in 2007 that emerged in the IBNR lines. And I think we've had 26 years now of favorable development. There's 2 ways we could have looked at that. We could have said, ""Well, there are anomalies, and we'll just let that emergence come out of IBNR."" Or I think the prudent approach and consistent with the way we do things is to actually react to that by increasing our factors, which would then subsequently roll through the accident years and add additional IBNR to all those accident years. I think it's the prudent way to look at that. And I think -- I'm confident, as you look at our Schedule Ps, that you'll find our reserves and balance sheet at least as strong at the end of '14 as you did at the end of '13."

We had a significant year in 2013 there, and it's -- that was in the area of larger workers' comp. It's an area that we are conservative on. Very pleased with the progress we're making on the loss for a lot of reasons. But we just simply did not write as many larger workers' comp claims, and that can tend to have a slightly muting effect on overall package business because typically, our agents like to put the workers' comp with the package. So I chalked that up to conservatism on that particular line of business. Maybe overly conservative, I suppose, but that would have been a factor. The other factor that occurred and really started occurring, I think, really and maybe in the second quarter. But clearly, I think most carriers are feeling they've reached pretty close to rate adequacy and rather than signaling to their agents that they would be asking for and requiring fairly substantial rate increases at renewal. Instead, they are defending the renewals more strongly. So the atmosphere we're competing in is one where there aren't as many what I would consider to be good accounts or easier or more desirable accounts out in the marketplace. We still have our pipeline full, but segmentation is playing through the -- for every carrier. And so the accounts that need the most rate or might have a more poor experience are the ones that are more likely out in the marketplace. So it's just tougher from that standpoint.
A few other things I would comment on, and I don't know how to fix other carriers, but the M&A activity that's occurred over the last 3, 4 years, that's fairly disruptive at the agency level. As some producers leave, the acquirers change the appetite for some agencies. We react to that. In some cases, it works out favorably for us. And in some cases, the consequence might be that we would appoint more agencies, and that takes a little bit more time for things to gear up. So we're not pushing any panic buttons in terms of the fact that new business was down. CSU, our Excess & Surplus Lines division, continued strong. We think we have tremendous potential there. Personal Lines is stabilized, and we think that you'll see an increase in new business in 2015 there. So it's -- maybe a little wordy, but those are kind of observations that we have. It's very reinforcing to be out this week with our agencies and hear their opinions of the marketplace and their confidence in us. So we'll keep our pipeline full, and we'll be good selectors of businesses through this year proceeds."

CSU is a -- we had a lot of feedback on that. Our agency is right, ballpark $2 billion in Excess & Surplus Lines premium, and so we have tremendous opportunity to grow our E&S company there. We gradually increased our appetite in that line of business, and so they're pleased to hear the news on that. Our Target Markets division has 17 programs, and that's going to expand. If there's anything, I guess, that's really created most of a wish list or a discussion at our sales meetings would be that they would ask that we continue to grow that particular division. Every agency, every aggressive agency, I would say, is niching. They have producers. They go after certain industry classes.

Cyber is talked about a bit, it's being talked about by everyone, but that's on the radar screen for everyone as an emerging coverage that we're pleased to tell them we have some things in the works on."

As in recent years, I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the fourth stop on our tour of sales meeting with our independent agents in more than 20 states.
Meeting annually with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented, agency-centered strategy. We also enjoy this part of our job and find it energizing.
It's important to sincerely thank our agents in person for contributing to another year of underwriting profit and premium growth and for trusting Cincinnati Insurance as we earn the opportunity to serve the people and businesses in their communities.
Turning to our financial performance. We feel good about the strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the year 2014. They continue to reflect steady execution in our underwriting and pricing. We had our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth, and rising valuations in equity security markets helped boost book value for your company. Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with an improved expense ratio, led to a fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio of 90.4%, lowering the full year ratio to 95.6%.
We are further segmenting our book of business using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. That's an ongoing focus as we seek to further improve underwriting results. We think those actions will continue to provide benefits over time as we aim for a combined ratio below 95% in 2015.
Working with our agents, we benefit from the local presence of our field underwriters who make those decisions for all of our commercial new business. Their decisions are informed by analytics and risk inspection data from our ongoing loss control program.
We're pleased that 2014 was another year in which we met our premium growth objective of outpacing industry growth, thanks to strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing. 
Growth we reported for the fourth quarter reflected the favorable offsetting effect of the same factor of the slow growth reported last year, the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline -- I mean, last quarter, reported last quarter of the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline.
As we noted several times before, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth. Part of our long-term strategy is deploying agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve established agency relationships and the franchise value they enjoy.
In 2014, we appointed 99 new independent agencies and plan to appoint about 100 more in 2015. Our agency partners do a great job helping us retain profitable accounts.
Policy retention from both Commercial and Personal Lines was generally consistent with the year ago. Our Commercial Lines policy retention continues near the high end of the mid-80% range, and Personal Lines policy retention continues in a low to mid-90% range.
We continue to work hard to earn new business through our agencies. New products and services, such as expanding programs offered through our Target Markets department, are an important part of growing new business.
We are also excited by new business opportunities we'll see by expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policyholders and -- offered through our Personal Lines insurance segment. You'll hear more about that over the next few quarters as we march towards a longer-term goal of $2 billion in the Inter-Personal Lines segment premiums.
Although our new business volume was down from 2013, the new business premiums reached a record level for us. Our agencies still produced over $1.5 billion in new business premiums in 2014.
For the fourth quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines remained in the low single-digit range, a little lower than in the third quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the fourth quarter.
For smaller commercial property and commercial auto policies that renewed during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced increases averaging in the high single-digit range, and commercial auto average increases in the mid-single-digit range.
For our Personal Lines policies, renewal price increases averaged near the high end of the low single-digit range. For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, the fourth quarter 2014 average renewal price increases continued in the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business hit a home run in 2014 with a combined ratio of below 80% and net written premiums up 20%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, produced another quarter of steady earnings and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.
January 1 marked the renewal of our primary property casualty reinsurance treaties. Our per-risk treaty's terms for 2015 are similar to last year, except for an increase in our retention by $2 million to $10 million per  loss. That change in more favorable rates should result in approximately $21 million less in reinsurance cost for those treaties compared with 2014.
Our property catastrophe treaty also has terms similar to last year, except for an increase in our retention by $25 million to $100 million per event. We expect our season premiums for that treaty to be approximately $8 million less than last year.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value-creation ratio, ended 2014 at 12.6%. That result was toward the high end of our target, which is an annual ratio averaging 10% to 13%. While a healthy stock market contributed, majority of the 12.6% was due to the contribution of operating income.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to add his insights about our recent financial performance."
260681,281275099,756578,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend incom",881,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Both income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend income from our stock portfolio rose 6% for the quarter and 13% for the year. At our core portfolio of 50 common stocks, all 50 improved their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period ending December 2014 with a median increase of 8.3%.
Similar to others in our industry, yields for our bond portfolio continued to decline. The fourth quarter 2014 pretax average yield, reported at 4.72%, was 13 basis points lower than a year ago, while that measure on a full year was 14 basis lower.
Taxable bonds, representing nearly 70% of our bond portfolio, had a pretax yield of approximately 5.25% at the end of the fourth quarter 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was 4.49%. For the same period, our tax-exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.78%, and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.26%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained at the same level as one quarter ago at 4.4 years.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2014 were up 10% to $873 million, contributing to $324 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Careful expense management continues to be a priority, and together with premium growth, contributed to a 1.3% point of improvement to our full year 2014 underwriting expense ratio. 
We like to analyze the underwriting expense ratio's 2 components: commissions and noncommission expenses. The commission components tend to vary with recent year underwriting profitability. It also considers 3-year profitability by agency. So if the commission ratio were to rise, it should be more than offset by a lower loss ratio. The noncommission component tends to vary as a result of investments we make in the property casualty business, such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise. Again, we believe it would be worth the trade-off of a short-term increase in that component to create overall value for investors and others. We plan to continue to have non-commission expense dollar volume grow more slowly to premium volume, producing a favorable effect on the non-commission expense ratio.
Next, let's turn to loss reserves. I'd like to emphasize that we follow a consistent approach in that we have experienced 26 years -- consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. We continue to aim for a reserve reported on our balance sheet to be at the levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuary estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.
Our news release reported higher reserve estimates for our commercial casualty line of business. That translated in 2014 to a lower amount of total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years, although, in aggregate, our other lines of businesses were slightly more favorable than in 2013. Once we complete all of our year-end reporting, we'll be able to further analyze the details.
For now, I'll highlight a few important items. For a long time, we disclosed the historical paid loss patterns or our key assumptions used to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves.
During 2014, paid losses for commercial casualty, especially related to a few umbrella liability claims, emerged at levels higher than we expected, particularly for accident years 2005 and 2007. Considering that new data, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for subsequent accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with the recent past quarters.
Overall, our full year 2014 net favorable development was, as usual, spread over several accident years, including 58% for accident year 2013; 15% for accident year 2012; 17% for accident year 2011; and 10% for all older accident years in aggregate.
The capital liquidity position of the company reflects both strength and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company, nearly $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, was up 16% for the year. Our property casualty premium to surplus ratio at 0.9:1 continues to provide capital that adequately supports our plans for ongoing growth of insurance operations. We did not purchase additional shares during the fourth quarter. Full year 2014 share repurchases totaled 450,000 shares at an average price per share of $46.63.
I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing our contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.40. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.06. The changes in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.77, and we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.13 during the fourth quarter to a record high of $40.14 per share.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

In closing our prepared remarks, I'll note that during the fourth quarter, Fitch Ratings and A. M. Best affirmed their strong ratings of our companies.

Since its start-up in 2008, our Excess & Surplus Lines business has established a good track record, and we expect it to continue attracting more of our agents business. That's just one of many factors that give us confidence we can perform and benefit shareholders over the coming years. 
The board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by increasing the cash dividend to $0.46 per share. That action sets the stage for 55 consecutive years of dividend increases.

There's 2 ways we could have looked at that. We could have said, ""Well, there are anomalies, and we'll just let that emergence come out of IBNR."" Or I think the prudent approach and consistent with the way we do things is to actually react to that by increasing our factors, which would then subsequently roll through the accident years and add additional IBNR to all those accident years. I think it's the prudent way to look at that. And I think -- I'm confident, as you look at our Schedule Ps, that you'll find our reserves and balance sheet at least as strong at the end of '14 as you did at the end of '13."

We had a significant year in 2013 there, and it's -- that was in the area of larger workers' comp. It's an area that we are conservative on. Very pleased with the progress we're making on the loss for a lot of reasons. But we just simply did not write as many larger workers' comp claims, and that can tend to have a slightly muting effect on overall package business because typically, our agents like to put the workers' comp with the package. So I chalked that up to conservatism on that particular line of business. Maybe overly conservative, I suppose, but that would have been a factor. The other factor that occurred and really started occurring, I think, really and maybe in the second quarter. But clearly, I think most carriers are feeling they've reached pretty close to rate adequacy and rather than signaling to their agents that they would be asking for and requiring fairly substantial rate increases at renewal. Instead, they are defending the renewals more strongly. So the atmosphere we're competing in is one where there aren't as many what I would consider to be good accounts or easier or more desirable accounts out in the marketplace. We still have our pipeline full, but segmentation is playing through the -- for every carrier. And so the accounts that need the most rate or might have a more poor experience are the ones that are more likely out in the marketplace. So it's just tougher from that standpoint.
A few other things I would comment on, and I don't know how to fix other carriers, but the M&A activity that's occurred over the last 3, 4 years, that's fairly disruptive at the agency level. As some producers leave, the acquirers change the appetite for some agencies. We react to that. In some cases, it works out favorably for us. And in some cases, the consequence might be that we would appoint more agencies, and that takes a little bit more time for things to gear up. So we're not pushing any panic buttons in terms of the fact that new business was down. CSU, our Excess & Surplus Lines division, continued strong. We think we have tremendous potential there. Personal Lines is stabilized, and we think that you'll see an increase in new business in 2015 there. So it's -- maybe a little wordy, but those are kind of observations that we have. It's very reinforcing to be out this week with our agencies and hear their opinions of the marketplace and their confidence in us. So we'll keep our pipeline full, and we'll be good selectors of businesses through this year proceeds."

So we think there are still opportunities with modest rate increases, but we've put a lot of effort in the last few years, and we're going to continue to accelerate that in loss control, in claims specialization, in underwriting specializations, so -- and just general inspections of business. So we expect those kinds of activities will help us discover accounts that when we wrote them, perhaps years ago, they were better accounts than they are today. So we'll react accordingly there. And then our loss control efforts will help with loss mitigation efforts. Marty might want to comment on the claims side of things, but the rate improvement we've had in workers comp, for example, we think can continue in the programs we've been making there.

CSU is a -- we had a lot of feedback on that. Our agency is right, ballpark $2 billion in Excess & Surplus Lines premium, and so we have tremendous opportunity to grow our E&S company there. We gradually increased our appetite in that line of business, and so they're pleased to hear the news on that. Our Target Markets division has 17 programs, and that's going to expand. If there's anything, I guess, that's really created most of a wish list or a discussion at our sales meetings would be that they would ask that we continue to grow that particular division. Every agency, every aggressive agency, I would say, is niching. They have producers. They go after certain industry classes. And while it's not unusual for carriers to have that, what is a bit unusual from our standpoint is the fact that we have some managers in those areas, they'll go out and travel with agencies, go out and make sales calls with those agencies. So we -- maybe we outworth the competition a little bit better in that category. So I would say those would be the major areas that we've improved. Loss control continues to be a benefit. Our agencies are good. We're taking our loss control rep, our claims rep and our field underwriters are actually on the sales call, and feedback we get on that is excellent. So no particular area.

The quarter included several areas of good performance, including enhancing our balance sheet strength. We see incremental progress as we steadily execute our underwriting and pricing strategies. And our investment strategy is successful portfolio management produced our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth. 
Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with more favorable weather than the first 3 months of last year and to a first quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 97.5%. While that ratio improved by 2.8 points compared with the year ago, it did not meet our expectations.
Every major line in our property casualty segments except for our commercial and personal auto had loss ratios that translated into estimated combined ratios near or within the 90% to 95% range. We strengthen reserves for those auto lines of business causing our overall combined ratio to rise above the sub-95% we're seeking for the year 2015. And we believe our balance sheet is now stronger than it was at year end.
We continue to further segment our business using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and informed underwriting judgment on a policy by policy basis.
In the first quarter, we experienced strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing although premium growth continues to slow as we exercise pricing and underwriting discipline. As noted in the past, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on a single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth.
We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies and we experienced a healthy pace of new business premium growth in our personal lines and excess and surplus lines segments.
In addition to continuing to develop new products and services through our target markets department, we continue to make progress on expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policyholders offered through our personal lines insurance segments.
We believe we are on track to begin offering a new suite of high net worth insurance products in the second half of this year through agents in the state of New York. Those products will include higher coverage limits than we offer today along with other new options.
In addition to growth opportunities with our agencies on a direct written premium basis, we see long-term opportunities in assumed reinsurance. 
Last night, we announced with a separate new release an important initial step for realizing future opportunities. Hiring Jamie Hall as Managing Director, head of reinsurance assumed to lead this initiative.
We recognize the current challenges in the reinsurance market and we'll be trying to grow that business quickly. Instead, we'll take our time and maintain underwriting discipline as we develop relationships and expertise that we believe will benefit the company and shareholders over the long term.
Looking forward toward 2020, we're in the early phases of establishing the vision of what's to come. As always, that vision will include continuing to profitably grow the company with our successful agency-centered model in focusing on our value creation ratio to measure long-term value for shareholders.
Over time, we expect to develop more specific objectives and plans and we'll communicate them at appropriate times.
For the first quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continued at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range, very similar to the fourth quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the first quarter. For smaller commercial property, commercial auto policies that renewed during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced percentage increases averaging in the high single-digit range. In commercial auto, average increases in the mid-single-digit range.
For our personal auto policies, renewal price percentage increases averaged near the low end of the mid-single digit range. Homeowner policies were a little higher in the same range. For our excess and surplus lines segment, the first quarter of 2015 average renewal price increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business turned in another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio of below 90% and net written premiums up 20%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, again contributed nicely to earnings and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 1.3% for the first quarter with operating income leading the way. We feel we are well positioned for the overall financial performance for the remainder of 2015.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to add his insights about our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks, to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of our investment results. Our investment income grew in the first quarter, mainly from the boost by the stock portfolio dividends that rose 13% for the quarter. Yields continue to slowly decline for our bond portfolio. We generated a 1% increase in interest income over the first quarter of 2014 as our net purchases of bonds during the last 4 quarters totaled $375 million. Our bond portfolio's first quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported at 4.7% was 12 basis points lower than 1 year ago but only 2 basis points lower than what we reported for the fourth quarter of 2014. We now report in our 10-Q the yields for new bonds purchased during the quarter and we added a table for yields of bonds expected to be redeemed by year for the next 2 to 3 years. You can see that taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34% while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.13%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained the same level as last year end at 4.4 years.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income grow. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2015 rose 67% to $215 million, contributing to $93 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $38 million less for catastrophe losses was part of the reason for the increase in operating cash flow for the first quarter of this year compared with the year ago.
We're still carefully managing expenses. And the 0.02 ratio increase for the property casualty underwriting expense ratio was also explained in our 10-Q. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we think investing in our business in areas such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise is a good trade-off over time. A short-term increase in expense can create long-term value for investors. As an example, since the first quarter of last year, we strategically invested in the personal lines of staff additions to support high net worth market expansion and we anticipate a good return on that investment.
Loss reserves are the next subject of my comments. Our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past as we aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarily estimated range of net loss and loss experience reserves. In the first quarter, we strengthened reserves for our auto lines of business. For our other lines in total, the best estimate by our actuaries of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios for all accident years in aggregate was similar to our year-end estimate. The ratio for our total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was similar to the full year of 2014, benefiting the combined ratio by a little more than 2 points.
Overall, our first quarter 2015 net favorable development was as usual, spread over several accident years, including 30% for accident year 2014; 22% for accident year 2013; 39% for accident year 2012; and 9% for all older accident years in aggregate.
Steve noted that we enhanced the strength of our balance sheet this quarter. There are many ways to assess capital strength and we think it's an important aspect is our liquidity and financial flexibility.
Cash and marketable securities for our parent company rose 2% from year end, topping $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our strong capital also positions us well to continue to grow our insurance operations.
I'll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.11. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.37. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.19. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value by $0.18 and we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.08 during the first quarter to another record high of $40.22 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We were taking significant increases in home order rates over the last several years that have moderated now. That drove a lot of the growth. We think we've reached rate adequacy in a lot of the states and so we're doing a fair amount of tweaking but nothing as drastic as we have been. We're also in the process of running off our Florida-originated personal lines book of business. That started last July. And so that's contributing to an absence or it's diluting growth in the homeowner line as well. So that will finish up, we have 1 more quarter of that. And then beginning in the third quarter, the comparisons will be without the effect of Florida. Our new business in homeowners was up 16%. The initiative we have with the high net worth is really starting to take effect right now so we're seeing a bit more business generated in the higher net worth area in both homeowner and auto for that matter. So I think what you'll see, without making any predictions of it, is a rebound in the growth rate in the homeowners line."

It was willfully enacted, inadequate and had gotten at that way over a period of time for, really, matters related to legislative reasons where the legislator had passed limitations. They could not raise rates for our book of business for our rates to the level we had to have. It took us a lot of time to exhaust all those options and when it was finally concluded that we were not going to be able to get adequate rate increases, we chose to leave. There wasn't going to be enough relief, not even close to enough relief in reinsurance cost in Florida to cause us to believe that the risk we were taking at the rates we were being allowed to charge were worth it. So in the Commercial Lines area, there is more rate flexibility. Obviously, the Department of Insurance is interested in protecting the personal lines clients whereas business clients, or big boys, can make their own decisions about what they pay for insurance. So we're still there in Commercial Lines, we still monitor what goes on within the state. It could very well be that based on more flexibility in the state of Florida that we could someday write more business down there. But as it is right now, the only personal lines business that we're writing in Florida is business that's collateralized. By that, I mean it's originated from states outside Florida with business that we believe, warrants us to take whatever risk we might take on a secondary residence in Florida."

I guess one thing I would like to make, one point is, is assumed reinsurance is not entirely new to us here at Cincinnati over the past year. I guess over the past 20 years or so, voluntary assumed reinsurance has been as high as about 2.4% of our net writings. This has largely been done through the various pools, retrosessions that we've been involved with, with reinsurers and companies that we've had loan additions with. But we've been very passive participants in, in my opinion, we kind of lacked expertise and recognizing that it's a tough market. Right now, we're down to just 1 contract that we're involved with. So we feel in here, we've got the opportunity to bring in, really some excellent talent. And Jamie Hall, we know we have a known quantity. We have a long successful relationship with both Jamie and as you mentioned, with GLT, we've worked together for a long time and we are, as you mentioned, we're confident that we'll get good the deal flow from GLT over time, as well as other entities that we work with. We think Jamie is going to bring with him or maybe not bring with him is probably not the right word, but he will establish a small team of experts as part of Cincinnati Insurance. We're going to do this without establishing a new legal entity combined company and we're going to execute what we describe as an allocated capital model. We're going to do our best just contract by contract to estimate the capital that will be needed for that individual policy. And we'll only move forward if we feel we can get our fair risk-adjusted return on that policy. We recognize this is a really tough market right now and we're going to be very judicious. Just look at everything, kind of to the other point, policy by policy, we don't have a specific line of business strategy or anything like that. This is going to be very much technically based on a policy by policy basis. We're only going to look at diversifying opportunities. So obviously, nothing in the Midwestern convective storm area. And we think the diversification that we may be able to achieve over time should really be helpful to us in driving up our overall risk-adjusted returns. Again, we're going to very much walk before we run and be very disciplined in putting our capital to work here."

Actually, this is the first time we've done any national TV ads. The ad is being run 2 weeks on 2 weeks off, it run through September. It's being seen on CNN and Fox News, a variety of shows on Fox News, so that can run the gamut from Bell O'Reilly to Anderson Cooper. There's a demographic on those cable channels that we like in terms of it being a slightly higher net worth audience that we're interested in but also business owners. So we're not trying, I guess the point I would make, we're certainly not trying to compete with the major advertisers out there. What we're wanting to do is, as we have in the past, is to showcase the value of an agent and the role the agent plays in their relationship with our company. And simultaneously with that, we have ramped up a lot, our digital advertising. And so obviously, the TV ad is, we'll play a part in all this but digital advertising will play a major part. As much as the public is an audience for this ad, we want our agents to be an audience for it as well and as a result of seeing Cincinnati Insurance Company under national level, that creates confidence in them, certainly with our expansion and listen to some areas where Cincinnati Insurance Company had not been active, it's valuable for our name to be out there so that they can make reference to it and for that matter, I would be writing first lines businesses in New York City. So to be seen by potential customers there would be a value. So it's part of a very large initiative that we have, both internal with our agencies, digitally, as well as nationally. So I'd expect you'll see a consistency in this but certainly not a drastic expansion there. And we have been, we're measuring both qualitatively and quantitatively the effects of it and we're seeing, on our website, more activity on the weeks that we're on and most notably, they find an agent tab that is clicked by visitors, has gone up significantly as a result -- during the times that these adds are playing. So we think it's paying off already."

The quarter included several areas of good performance, including enhancing our balance sheet strength. We see incremental progress as we steadily execute our underwriting and pricing strategies. And our investment strategy in successful portfolio management produced our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth. 
Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with more favorable weather than the first 3 months of last year lead to a first quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 97.5%. While that ratio improved by 2.8 points compared with the year ago, it did not meet our expectations.
Every major line in our property casualty segments, except for our Commercial and Personal auto, had loss ratios that translated into estimated combined ratios near or within the 90% to 95% range. We strengthen reserves for those auto lines of business causing our overall combined ratio to rise above the sub-95% we're seeking for the year 2015. And we believe our balance sheet is now stronger than it was at year end.
We continue to further segment our business using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and informed underwriting judgment on a policy-by-policy basis.
In the first quarter, we experienced strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing, although premium growth continues to slow as we exercise pricing and underwriting discipline. As noted in the past, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on a single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth.
We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, and we experienced a healthy pace of new business premium growth in our Personal Lines and Excess & Surplus Lines segments.
In addition to continuing to develop new products and services through our target markets department, we continue to make progress on expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policyholders offered through our Personal Lines Insurance segments.
We believe we are on track to begin offering a new suite of high net worth insurance products in the second half of this year through agents in the state of New York. Those products will include higher coverage limits than we offer today along with other new options.
In addition to growth opportunities with our agencies on a direct written premium basis, we see long-term opportunities in assumed reinsurance. 
Last night, we announced, with a separate news release, an important initial step for realizing future opportunities, hiring Jamie Hole as Managing Director, Head of Reinsurance, assumed to lead this initiative.
We recognize the current challenges in the reinsurance market and won't be trying to grow that business quickly. Instead, we'll take our time and maintain underwriting discipline as we develop relationships and expertise that we believe will benefit the company and shareholders over the long term.
Looking forward -- toward 2020, we're in the early phases of establishing the vision of what's to come. As always, that vision will include continuing to profitably grow the company with our successful agency-centered model in focusing on our value creation ratio to measure long-term value for shareholders.  Over time, we expect to develop more specific objectives and plans, and we'll communicate them at appropriate times.
For the first quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continued at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range, very similar to the fourth quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the first quarter. 
For smaller commercial property, commercial auto policies that renewed during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced percentage increases averaging in the high single-digit range. 
In commercial auto, average increases in the mid-single-digit range.  For our personal auto policies, renewal price percentage increases averaged near the low end of the mid-single digit range. Homeowner policies were a little higher in the same range. 
For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, the first quarter of 2015 average renewal price increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business turned in another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio below 90% and net written premiums up 20%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, again contributed nicely to earnings and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 1.3% for the first quarter, with operating income leading the way. We feel we are well positioned for good overall financial performance for the remainder of 2015.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to add his insights about our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income grew in the first quarter, mainly from the boost by stock portfolio dividends that rose 13% for the quarter. Yields continue to slowly decline for our bond portfolio. We generated a 1% increase in interest income over the first quarter of 2014 as our net purchases of bonds during the last 4 quarters totaled $375 million. 
Our bond portfolio's first quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported at 4.7% was 12 basis points lower than 1 year ago but only 2 basis points lower than what we reported for the fourth quarter of 2014. We now report in our 10-Q the yields for new bonds purchased during the quarter, and we added a table for yields of bonds expected to be redeemed by year for the next 2 to 3 years. You can see that taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.13%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained the same level as last year end at 4.4 years.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income grow. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2015 rose 67% to $215 million, contributing to $93 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $38 million less for catastrophe losses was part of the reason for the increase in operating cash flow for the first quarter of this year compared with the year ago.
We're still carefully managing expenses. And the 0.02 ratio increase for the property casualty underwriting expense ratio was also explained in our 10-Q. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we think investing our business in areas such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise is a good trade-off over time. A short-term increase in expense can create long-term value for investors. As an example, since the first quarter of last year, we strategically invested in the Personal Lines staff additions to support high net worth market expansion, and we anticipate a good return on that investment.
Loss reserves are the next subject of my comments. Our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past, as we aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened reserves for our auto lines of business. For our other lines in total, the best estimate by our actuaries of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios for all accident years in aggregate was similar to our year-end estimate. The ratio for our total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was similar to the full year 2014, benefiting the combined ratio by a little more than 2 points.
Overall, our first quarter 2015 net favorable development was, as usual, spread over several accident years, including 30% for accident year 2014; 22% for accident year 2013; 39% for accident year 2012; and 9% for all older accident years in aggregate.
Steve noted that we enhanced the strength of our balance sheet this quarter. There are many ways to assess capital strength, and we think it's an important aspect is our liquidity and financial flexibility.
Cash and marketable securities for our parent company rose 2% from year end, topping $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our strong capital also positions us well to continue to grow our insurance operations.
I'll end my prepared remarks, as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.11. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.37. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.19. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.18. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.08 during the first quarter to another record high of $40.22 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We're also in the process of running off our Florida-originated Personal Lines book of business. That started last July. And so that's contributing to an absence or it's diluting growth in the Homeowner Line as well. So that'll finish up, we have 1 more quarter of that. And then beginning in the third quarter, the comparisons will be without the effect of Florida. Our new business in homeowners was up 16%. The initiative we have with a high net worth is really starting to take effect right now, so we're seeing a bit more business generated in the higher net worth area in both homeowner and auto for that matter.

There wasn't going to be enough relief, not even close to enough relief in reinsurance cost in Florida to cause us to believe that the risk we were taking at the rates we were being allowed to charge were worth it. So in the Commercial Lines area, there is more rate flexibility. Obviously, the Department of Insurance is interested in protecting the Personal Lines clients whereas business clients can -- or big boys can make their own decisions about what they pay for insurance. So we're still there in Commercial Lines, we still monitor what goes on within the state. It could very well be that based on more flexibility in the state of Florida that we could someday write more business down there. But for -- as it is right now, the only personal lines business that we're writing in Florida is business that's collateralized. By that, I mean, it's originated from states outside Florida with business that we believe warrants us to take whatever risk we might take on a secondary residence in Florida."

Do you think the attitude has changed by giving numbers right versus getting them overestimated has changed?

I guess, one thing I'd like to make, one point is, this assumed reinsurance is not entirely new to us here at Cincinnati over the past year. I guess, over the past 20 years or so, voluntary assumed reinsurance has been as high as about 2.4% of our net writings. This has largely been done through the various pools, retrocessions that we've been involved with, with reinsurers and companies that we've had long relationships with. But we've been very passive participants. In my opinion, we've kind of lacked expertise and recognizing that it's a tough market. Right now, we're down to just 1 contract that we're involved with. So we feel here, we've got the opportunity to bring in really some excellent talent. And Jamie Hole, we know we have a known quantity. We've had a long successful relationship with both Jamie and, as you mentioned, with JLT. We've worked together for a long time, and we are, as you mentioned, we're confident that we'll get good deal flow from JLT over time as well as other entities that we work with. We think Jamie is going to bring with him -- or maybe not bring with him, it's probably not the right word, but he will establish a small team of experts as part of Cincinnati Insurance. We're going to do this without establishing a new legal entity, a new company, and we're going to execute what we, I think, we described as an allocated capital model. We're going to do our best just contract by contract to estimate the capital that would be needed for that individual policy. And we'll only move forward if we feel that we can get a fair risk-adjusted return on that policy. We recognize this is a really tough market right now, and we're going to be very judicious. Just look at everything, kind of to your other point, policy by policy, we don't have a specific line of business strategy or anything like that. This is going to be very much technically based on a policy-by-policy basis. We're only going to look at diversifying opportunities. So obviously, nothing in the Midwestern convective storm area. And we think the diversification that we may be able to achieve over time should really be helpful to us in driving up our overall risk-adjusted returns. Again, we're going to very much walk before we run and be very, very disciplined in putting our capital to work here."

As much as the public is an audience for this ad, we want our agents to be an audience for it as well. And as a result of seeing Cincinnati Insurance Company on a national level, that creates confidence in them, certainly with our expansion out west and to some areas where Cincinnati Insurance Company had not been active, it's valuable for our name to be out there, so that they can make reference to it. And for that matter, I would be writing first lines businesses in New York City. And so to be seen by potential customers there would be a value.

The quarter included several areas of good performance, including enhancing our balance sheet strength. We see incremental progress as we steadily execute our underwriting and pricing strategies. And our investment strategy in successful portfolio management produced our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth. 
Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing, along with more favorable weather than the first 3 months of last year led to a first quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 97.5%. While that ratio improved by 2.8 points compared with the year ago, it did not meet our expectations.
Every major line in our property casualty segments, except for our Commercial and Personal auto, had loss ratios that translated into estimated combined ratios near or within the 90% to 95% range. We strengthened reserves for those auto lines of business causing our overall combined ratio to rise above the sub-95% we're seeking for the year 2015. And we believe our balance sheet is now stronger than it was at year end.
We continue to further segment our business using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and informed underwriting judgment on a policy-by-policy basis.
In the first quarter, we experienced strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing, although premium growth continues to slow as we exercise pricing and underwriting discipline. As noted in the past, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on a single quarter of data for certain measures, including premium growth.
We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, and we experienced a healthy pace of new business premium growth in our Personal Lines and Excess & Surplus Lines segments.
In addition to continuing to develop new products and services through our target markets department, we continue to make progress on expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policyholders offered through our Personal Lines Insurance segments.
We believe we are on track to begin offering a new suite of high net worth insurance products in the second half of this year through agents in the state of New York. Those products will include higher coverage limits than we offer today along with other new options.
In addition to growth opportunities with our agencies on a direct written premium basis, we see long-term opportunities in assumed reinsurance. 
Last night, we announced, with a separate news release, an important initial step for realizing future opportunities, hiring Jamie Hole as Managing Director, Head of Reinsurance Assumed to lead this initiative.
We recognize the current challenges in the reinsurance market and won't be trying to grow that business quickly. Instead, we'll take our time and maintain underwriting discipline as we develop relationships and expertise that we believe will benefit the company and shareholders over the long term.
Looking forward -- toward 2020, we're in the early phases of establishing the vision of what's to come. As always, that vision will include continuing to profitably grow the company with our successful agency-centered model in focusing on our value creation ratio to measure long-term value for shareholders.  Over time, we expect to develop more specific objectives and plans, and we'll communicate them at appropriate times.
For the first quarter, average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continued at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range, very similar to the fourth quarter. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the first quarter. 
For smaller commercial property, commercial auto policies that renewed during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced percentage increases averaging in the high single-digit range. 
In commercial auto, average increases in the mid-single-digit range.  For our personal auto policies, renewal price percentage increases averaged near the low end of the mid-single digit range. Homeowner policies were a little higher in the same range. 
For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, the first quarter of 2015 average renewal price increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. That segment of our business turned in another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio below 90% and net written premiums up 20%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, again contributed nicely to earnings and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 1.3% for the first quarter, with operating income leading the way. We feel we are well positioned for good overall financial performance for the remainder of 2015.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to add his insights about our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income grew in the first quarter, mainly from the boost by stock portfolio dividends that rose 13% for the quarter. Yie",744,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income grew in the first quarter, mainly from the boost by stock portfolio dividends that rose 13% for the quarter. Yields continue to slowly decline for our bond portfolio. We generated a 1% increase in interest income over the first quarter of 2014 as our net purchases of bonds during the last 4 quarters totaled $375 million. 
Our bond portfolio's first quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported at 4.7% was 12 basis points lower than 1 year ago but only 2 basis points lower than what we reported for the fourth quarter of 2014. We now report in our 10-Q the yields for new bonds purchased during the quarter, and we added a table for yields of bonds expected to be redeemed by year for the next 2 to 3 years. You can see that taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.13%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration remained the same level as last year end at 4.4 years.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income grow. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2015 rose 67% to $215 million, contributing to $93 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $38 million less for catastrophe losses was part of the reason for the increase in operating cash flow for the first quarter of this year compared with the year ago.
We're still carefully managing expenses. And the 0.02 ratio increase for the property casualty underwriting expense ratio was also explained in our 10-Q. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we think investing our business in areas such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise is a good trade-off over time. A short-term increase in expense can create long-term value for investors. As an example, since the first quarter of last year, we strategically invested in the Personal Lines staff additions to support high net worth market expansion, and we anticipate a good return on that investment.
Loss reserves are the next subject of my comments. Our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past, as we aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened reserves for our auto lines of business. For our other lines in total, the best estimate by our actuaries of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios for all accident years in aggregate was similar to our year-end estimate. The ratio for our total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was similar to the full year 2014, benefiting the combined ratio by a little more than 2 points.
Overall, our first quarter 2015 net favorable development was, as usual, spread over several accident years, including 30% for accident year 2014; 22% for accident year 2013; 39% for accident year 2012; and 9% for all older accident years in aggregate.
Steve noted that we enhanced the strength of our balance sheet this quarter. There are many ways to assess capital strength, and we think it's an important aspect is our liquidity and financial flexibility.
Cash and marketable securities for our parent company rose 2% from year end, topping $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our strong capital also positions us well to continue to grow our insurance operations.
I'll end my prepared remarks, as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.11. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.37. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.19. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.18. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.08 during the first quarter to another record high of $40.22 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We were taking some pretty significant increases in homeowner rates over the last several years that have moderated now. That drove a lot of the growth. We think we've reached rate adequacy in a lot of the states, and so we're doing a fair amount of tweaking, but nothing as drastic as we had been. We're also in the process of running off our Florida-originated Personal Lines book of business. That started last July. And so that's contributing to an absence or it's diluting growth in the Homeowner Line as well. So that'll finish up, we have 1 more quarter of that. And then beginning in the third quarter, the comparisons will be without the effect of Florida. Our new business in homeowners was up 16%. The initiative we have with a high net worth is really starting to take effect right now, so we're seeing a bit more business generated in the higher net worth area in both homeowner and auto for that matter. So I think what you'll see, without making any predictions of it, is a rebound in the growth rate in the Homeowners Line."

It was willfully inactive, inadequate and had gotten at that way over a period of time for, really, matters related to legislative reasons, where the legislator had passed limitations. They could not raise rates for our book of business, for our rates to the level we had to have. It took us a lot of time to exhaust all those options, and when it was finally concluded that we were not going to be able to get adequate rate increases, we chose to leave. There wasn't going to be enough relief, not even close to enough relief in reinsurance cost in Florida to cause us to believe that the risk we were taking at the rates we were being allowed to charge were worth it. So in the Commercial Lines area, there is more rate flexibility. Obviously, the Department of Insurance is interested in protecting the Personal Lines clients whereas business clients can -- or big boys can make their own decisions about what they pay for insurance. So we're still there in Commercial Lines, we still monitor what goes on within the state. It could very well be that based on more flexibility in the state of Florida that we could someday write more business down there. But for -- as it is right now, the only personal lines business that we're writing in Florida is business that's collateralized. By that, I mean, it's originated from states outside Florida with business that we believe warrants us to take whatever risk we might take on a secondary residence in Florida."

I guess, one thing I'd like to make, one point is, this assumed reinsurance is not entirely new to us here at Cincinnati over the past year. I guess, over the past 20 years or so, voluntary assumed reinsurance has been as high as about 2.4% of our net writings. This has largely been done through the various pools, retrocessions that we've been involved with, with reinsurers and companies that we've had long relationships with. But we've been very passive participants. In my opinion, we've kind of lacked expertise and recognizing that it's a tough market. Right now, we're down to just 1 contract that we're involved with. So we feel here, we've got the opportunity to bring in really some excellent talent. And Jamie Hole, we know we have a known quantity. We've had a long successful relationship with both Jamie and, as you mentioned, with JLT. We've worked together for a long time, and we are, as you mentioned, we're confident that we'll get good deal flow from JLT over time as well as other entities that we work with. We think Jamie is going to bring with him -- or maybe not bring with him, it's probably not the right word, but he will establish a small team of experts as part of Cincinnati Insurance. We're going to do this without establishing a new legal entity, a new company, and we're going to execute what we, I think, we described as an allocated capital model. We're going to do our best just contract by contract to estimate the capital that would be needed for that individual policy. And we'll only move forward if we feel that we can get a fair risk-adjusted return on that policy. We recognize this is a really tough market right now, and we're going to be very judicious. Just look at everything, kind of to your other point, policy by policy, we don't have a specific line of business strategy or anything like that. This is going to be very much technically based on a policy-by-policy basis. We're only going to look at diversifying opportunities. So obviously, nothing in the Midwestern convective storm area. And we think the diversification that we may be able to achieve over time should really be helpful to us in driving up our overall risk-adjusted returns.

Best, in one of their best weeks in March, put out the new rankings of companies with U.S. in net written premium. And we moved up to 22nd, so kind of over this period of time, we started at year-end 2010 as the 26th largest writer based on the United States net written premium. Each year we've moved up 1 position from 26th to 25th to 24th to 23rd, at the end of '14, 22nd. So I think setting and the work that goes in to setting these plans is very important.

So we're not trying -- I guess, the point I would make, we're certainly not trying to compete with the major advertisers out there. What we're wanting to do is, as we have in the past, is to showcase the value of an agent and the role the agent plays in their relationship with our company. And simultaneously with that, we have ramped up a lot our digital advertising. And so, obviously, the TV ad is -- will play a part in all this, but digital advertising will play a major part. As much as the public is an audience for this ad, we want our agents to be an audience for it as well. And as a result of seeing Cincinnati Insurance Company on a national level, that creates confidence in them, certainly with our expansion out west into some areas where Cincinnati Insurance Company had not been active, it's valuable for our name to be out there, so that they can make reference to it. And for that matter, we're going to be writing first lines businesses in New York City. And so to be seen by potential customers there would be a value. So it's part of a very large initiative that we have, both internal with our agencies digitally as well as nationally. So I'd expect you'll see a consistency in this, but certainly not a drastic expansion there.

Our results reflect well in our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit in our eighth consecutive quarter of investment income growth. 
Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was aided by more favorable weather than in the second quarter of last year. Together, they led to a second quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 92.4%. 
Our first half 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was 89.1%, improving on that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriting regiment to select and retain policies at prices we believe providing appropriate return for their risk we assume. We continue to earn quality business from our agencies, especially the areas we've been emphasizing such as personal lines, products and services fire agencies higher net worth clients. We are on track to release executive capstone, our new suite of high net worth insurance products in New York this quarter. 
We're also on track with progress for an initiative we announced earlier in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort, and we are developing a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to be very disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tougher insurance market conditions. 
We have already entered into a future release that will be reported during the third quarter, generating approximately $15 million in diversifying written premium in 2015. 
Overall pricing for the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter with average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continuing at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the second quarter. 
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the second quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with both lines averaging in the mid-single-digit range. 
Our personal auto policies average renewal price increases near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. The homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. 
For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, second quarter 2015 average renewal price percentage increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. 
The EMS segment continues to perform very well, from producing another quarter with combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premiums. 
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter, a double-digit growth in profit in the second quarter while our 6-month result in line with last year's first half. 
I'll conclude with a couple of points that I think are important for all company stakeholders to keep in mind. First, our primary measure of financial performance of the value creation ratio is designed long term in nature, so we're not along alarmed when that measure fall sort of target in the short term due to securities market volatility. Our insurance business is an excellent shape. We have confidence in all of our associates and the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
Second, those studying this industry over the years have seen other times were merger and acquisition activity generating excitement and speculation. We believe our proven successful strategy will continue to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. 
Looking forward to the next few years, our vision includes continuing to profitably grow the company with our agency model. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stock",712,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stocks in our core portfolio increased our annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of July 2014 through June 2015. The meeting dividend increase for those stocks was 7.7%. 
For our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first half 2015 net purchases totaling $311 million. 
The bond portfolio's second quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported at 4.64% was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.48% while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.43%. 
In both cases, those yields are higher than those we experienced a year ago and in the first quarter of this year. 
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 rose 34% compared with a year ago to $470 million and helped generate $394 million of net purchases of securities for investment portfolio. 
Paying $46 million less for catastrophe losses compared with a year ago helped drive the increase in operating cash flow for the first half of this year. 
We are still carefully managing our expenses while we continue to strategically invest in our business. We kept the second quarter and first half property casualty underwriting expense ratios essentially flat compared with prior periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts, low end to the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
For the first half of 2015, favorable development on prior accident years at 4.4% was essentially in line with 4.8% from the first half of last year. 
As we noted in our news release, we again prudently added IBNR reserves to our commercial and personal auto lines. At the same time, we were pleased to see another quarter of improvement in the case incurred loss ratio for those lines. 
Our 6-month 2015 net favorable development was against spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 23% for accident year 2013, 32% for accident year 2012 and 4% for all order accident years in aggregate. 
Our stellar capital strength includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at June 30 totaled nearly $1.8 million, up slightly from year-end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders. 
During the second quarter, we used $74 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $20 million to repurchase of 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $50.90 per share. 
Similar to our share repurchases in 2014, it was a maintenance type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. We represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.51. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance, and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.29. 
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses decrease book value per share by $0.71. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.32. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.62 during the second quarter to $39.60 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Overall, it was a strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits",670,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Overall, it was a strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. 
Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit in our eighth consecutive quarter of investment income growth. Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was aided by more favorable weather than in the second quarter of last year. Together, they led to a second quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 92.4%. Our first half 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was 89.1%, improving on that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriting judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, especially in areas we've been emphasizing, such as Personal Lines products and services for our agencies' higher net worth clients. We are on track to release Executive Capstone, our new suite of high-net-worth insurance products, in New York this quarter. 
We're also on track with progress for an initiative we announced early in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort, and we are developing a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to be very disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tougher insurance market conditions. We have already entered into a future release [ph] that will be reported during the third quarter, generating approximately $15 million in diversifying written premium in 2015. 
Overall pricing for the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter, with average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continuing at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the second quarter. For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the second quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with both lines averaging in the mid-single-digit range. 
Our Personal Auto policies average renewal price increase is near the low end of the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, second quarter 2015 average renewal price percentage increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. The E&S segment continues to perform very well, producing another quarter with combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter, a double-digit growth in profit in the second quarter brought our 6-month result in line with last year's first half. 
I'll conclude with a couple of points that I think are important for all company stakeholders to keep in mind. First, our primary measure of financial performance, the value-creation ratio, is designed long term in nature. So we're not alarmed when that measure falls short of target in the short term due to securities market volatility. Our insurance business is in excellent shape. We have confidence in all of our associates and the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
Second, those studying this industry over the years have seen other times where merger and acquisition activity generated excitement and speculation. We believe our proven successful strategy will continue to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Looking forward to the next few years, our vision includes continuing to profitably grow the company with our agency-centered model. 
I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.  First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stocks",709,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.  First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stocks in our core portfolio increased our annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of July 2014 through June 2015. The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.7%. For our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to first half 2015 net purchases totaling $311 million. 
The bond portfolio's second quarter 2015 pretax average yield, reported at 4.64%, was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.48% while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.43%. In both cases, those yields are higher than those we experienced a year ago and in the first quarter of this year. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 rose 34% compared with a year ago to $470 million and helped generate $394 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $46 million less for catastrophe losses compared with a year ago helped drive the increase in operating cash flow for the first half of this year. We are still carefully managing our expenses. While we continue to strategically invest in our business, we kept the second quarter and first half property casualty underwriting expense ratios essentially flat compared with prior periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts, well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. For the first half of 2015, favorable development on prior accident years at 4.4% was essentially in line with 4.8% from the first half of last year. As we noted in our news release, we again prudently added IBNR reserves to our Commercial and Personal Auto lines. At the same time, we were pleased to see another quarter of improvement in the case incurred loss ratio for those lines.  Our 6-month 2015 net favorable development was against spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 23% for accident year 2013, 32% for accident year 2012 and 4% for all older accident years in aggregate. 
Our stellar capital strength includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at June 30 totaled nearly $1.8 billion, up slightly from year-end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.  During the second quarter, we used $74 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $20 million to repurchase of 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $50.90 per share. Similar to our share repurchases in 2014, it was a maintenance-type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks, as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.51. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.71. 
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.32. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.62 during the second quarter to $39.60 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Overall, it was a strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits",670,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Overall, it was a strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. 
Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit in our eighth consecutive quarter of investment income growth. Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was aided by more favorable weather than in the second quarter of last year. Together, they led to a second quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 92.4%. Our first half 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was 89.1%, improving on that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriting judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, especially in areas we've been emphasizing, such as Personal Lines products and services for our agencies' higher net worth clients. We are on track to release Executive Capstone, our new suite of high-net-worth insurance products, in New York this quarter. 
We're also on track with progress for an initiative we announced early in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort, and we are developing a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to be very disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions. We have already entered into a few treaties that will be reported during the third quarter, generating approximately $15 million in diversifying written premium in 2015. 
Overall pricing for the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter, with average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continuing at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the second quarter. For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the second quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with both lines averaging in the mid-single-digit range. 
Our Personal Auto policies average renewal price increase is near the low end of the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, second quarter 2015 average renewal price percentage increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. The E&S segment continues to perform very well, producing another quarter with combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter, a double-digit growth in profit in the second quarter brought our 6-month result in line with last year's first half. 
I'll conclude with a couple of points that I think are important for all company stakeholders to keep in mind. First, our primary measure of financial performance, the value-creation ratio, is by design long term in nature. So we're not alarmed when that measure falls short of target in the short term due to securities market volatility. Our insurance business is in excellent shape. We have confidence in all of our associates and the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
Second, those studying this industry over the years have seen other times where merger and acquisition activity generated excitement and speculation. We believe our proven successful strategy will continue to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Looking forward to the next few years, our vision includes continuing to profitably grow the company with our agency-centered model. 
I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stock",710,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stocks in our core portfolio increased their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of July 2014 through June 2015. The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.7%. For our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first half 2015 net purchases totaling $311 million. 
The bond portfolio's second quarter 2015 pretax average yield, reported at 4.64%, was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.48% while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.43%. In both cases, those yields are higher than those we experienced a year ago and in the first quarter of this year. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 rose 34% compared with a year ago to $470 million and helped generate $394 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $46 million less for catastrophe losses compared with a year ago helped drive the increase in operating cash flow for the first half of this year. We are still carefully managing our expenses. While we continue to strategically invest in our business, we kept the second quarter and first half property casualty underwriting expense ratios essentially flat compared with prior periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. For the first half of 2015, favorable development on prior accident years at 4.4% was essentially in line with 4.8% from the first half of last year. As we noted in our news release, we again prudently added IBNR reserves to our Commercial and Personal Auto lines. At the same time, we were pleased to see another quarter of improvement in the case incurred loss ratio for those lines.  Our 6-month 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 23% for accident year 2013, 32% for accident year 2012 and 4% for all older accident years in aggregate. 
Our stellar capital strength includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at June 30 totaled nearly $1.8 billion, up slightly from year-end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.  During the second quarter, we used $74 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $20 million to repurchase of 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $50.90 per share. Similar to our share repurchases in 2014, it was a maintenance-type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks, as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.51. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.71. 
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.32. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.62 during the second quarter to $39.60 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Overall, it was a strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents.

Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. 
Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit in our eighth consecutive quarter of investment income growth. Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was aided by more favorable weather than in the second quarter of last year. Together, they led to a second quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 92.4%. Our first half 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was 89.1%, improving on that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriting judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, especially in areas we've been emphasizing, such as Personal Lines products and services for our agencies' higher net worth clients. We are on track to release Executive Capstone, our new suite of high-net-worth insurance products, in New York this quarter. 
We're also on track with progress for an initiative we announced early in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort, and we are developing a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to be very disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions. We have already entered into a few treaties that will be reported during the third quarter, generating approximately $15 million in diversifying written premium in 2015. 
Overall pricing for the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter, with average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continuing at percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the second quarter. For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the second quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with both lines averaging in the mid-single-digit range. 
Our Personal Auto policies average renewal price increase is near the low end of the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. For our Excess & Surplus Lines segment, second quarter 2015 average renewal price percentage increases were also near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. The E&S segment continues to perform very well, producing another quarter with combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter, a double-digit growth in profit in the second quarter brought our 6-month result in line with last year's first half. 
I'll conclude with a couple of points that I think are important for all company stakeholders to keep in mind. First, our primary measure of financial performance, the value-creation ratio, is by design long term in nature. So we're not alarmed when that measure falls short of target in the short term due to securities market volatility. Our insurance business is in excellent shape. We have confidence in all of our associates and the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
Second, those studying this industry over the years have seen other times where merger and acquisition activity generated excitement and speculation. We believe our proven successful strategy will continue to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Looking forward to the next few years, our vision includes continuing to profitably grow the company with our agency-centered model. 
I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stock",710,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stocks in our core portfolio increased their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of July 2014 through June 2015. The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.7%. For our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first half 2015 net purchases totaling $311 million. 
The bond portfolio's second quarter 2015 pretax average yield, reported at 4.64%, was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.48% while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.43%. In both cases, those yields are higher than those we experienced a year ago and in the first quarter of this year. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 rose 34% compared with a year ago to $470 million and helped generate $394 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $46 million less for catastrophe losses compared with a year ago helped drive the increase in operating cash flow for the first half of this year. We are still carefully managing our expenses. While we continue to strategically invest in our business, we kept the second quarter and first half property casualty underwriting expense ratios essentially flat compared with prior periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. For the first half of 2015, favorable development on prior accident years at 4.4% was essentially in line with 4.8% from the first half of last year. As we noted in our news release, we again prudently added IBNR reserves to our Commercial and Personal Auto lines. At the same time, we were pleased to see another quarter of improvement in the case incurred loss ratio for those lines.  Our 6-month 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 23% for accident year 2013, 32% for accident year 2012 and 4% for all older accident years in aggregate. 
Our stellar capital strength includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at June 30 totaled nearly $1.8 billion, up slightly from year-end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.  During the second quarter, we used $74 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $20 million to repurchase of 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $50.90 per share. Similar to our share repurchases in 2014, it was a maintenance-type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks, as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.51. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.71. 
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.32. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.62 during the second quarter to $39.60 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another strong quarter.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Overall, it was another strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and independent agents. 
We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit and the ninth consecutive quarter in our streak of investment income growth. 
Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was slightly offset by less favorable weather-related catastrophe effects than in the third quarter of last year. 
In total, we achieved a third quarter 2015 consolidated property cash casualty combined ratio of 87.8%. Our 9-month 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was also 87.8%, improving that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
Each of our major lines of business have performed well so far this year, except for Commercial Auto and Personal Auto. We continue to take action through better pricing precision and other initiatives for improved performance over time for our auto business. 
In late 2011, we established a long-term target of possibly reaching $5 billion in direct written premiums by the end of 2015. While it looks like we won't quite reach that level this year, we've often emphasized that we seek to grow only where we believe we can do so profitably. I'm pleased with our overall underwriting profitability so far this year and will be disappointed if we don't write $5 billion in premium until 2016. 
Over the past 5 years or so, our premium growth has approximately doubled the U.S. PNC industry. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, including areas we've been emphasizing such as personalized products and services for our agencies higher net worth clients. 
Of the $16 million increase in 9-month new business written premiums for our personalized segment, nearly 20% of the increase was from high net worth policies. We launched Executive Capstone, our new suite of high net worth insurance products in New York during September. We expect those products to contribute significantly to profitable premium growth over time. 
We're on track with progress for an initiative we announced in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort and continues to develop a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to remain disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions. 
At September 30, we had entered into a handful of diverse treaties. If each treaty remains in effect for its full term in premiums that are subject to the risk we are ensuring occur as anticipated, we estimate those treaties should generate approximately $30 million in premiums over the next year or so. 
Premiums losses and expenses recognized during the third quarter of 2015 for reinsurance assumed program were each less than $500,000 and immaterial effect on results for the quarter. 
Turning to renewal policies. As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriting judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. 
Overall pricing for the third quarter was similar to the second quarter. Average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the third quarter. 
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the third quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range. 
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, Worker's Compensation, averaged slightly negative pricing during the quarter. While the average pricing change may have been negative, we continue to price on a policy by policy basis. Certain policies that we determine needed the price increase received it. 
Our Personal Auto policies average renewal price increases near the low end of the mid-single-digit range while homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. 
For Excess & Surplus Lines segment, third quarter 2015 average renewal price percentage increases that were near the low end of the middle single-digit range. 
The segment continues to perform very well, producing another quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premium. 
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter. Strong growth and profit in the third quarter that our 9-month life insurance results above last year's. 
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, is by design long term in nature. We know that measure may sometimes fall below target in the short term due to securities market volatility. We are staying focused on underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business is in excellent shape, contributing more significantly to this year's 9-month value creation than a year ago. We have confidence in all of our associates and the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
I'd like to conclude by expressing my sympathy for those impacted by the flooding this fall. We sent a storm team of our own highly trained associates to South Carolina to meet face-to-face with policyholders quickly beginning the recovery process. 
We currently estimate our total losses from that industry catastrophe event to reach between $4 million and $8 million. That's $4 million and $8 million. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us to today. First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that per",656,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us to today. 
First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. 
While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that period with a net unrealized gain of over $1.5 billion before taxes for our common stockholdings in total. 
We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 4%. All 50 common stocks in our core portfolio increased their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of October 2014 through September 2015. 
The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.6%. 
For our equity maturity portfolio, our -- I'm sorry -- for our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to a 9-month 2015 net purchases totaling $486 million. The bond portfolio's third quarter 2015 pretax average yield, reported at 4.62%, was 14 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.64% while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.32%. In both cases, those yields are higher than we experienced a year ago. 
Our bond portfolio's effective duration as of September 30 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily due to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds, not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2015 rose 19% compared with a year ago to $755 million and helped generate $624 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. 
We're still carefully managing our expenses because we continue to strategically invest in our business. Third quarter and 9-month property casualty underwriting expense ratios rose slightly compared with prior year periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
For the first 9 months of 2015, favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefit our combined ratio 
[Audio Gap] 
for 2014 21% for accident year 2013, 29% for accident year 2012 and 9% for all order accident years in aggregate. 
Our capital strength remains excellent includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at September 30 total just over $1.8 billion, up 1% from year-end. 
Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders. 
During the third quarter, we used $73 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $21 million to repurchase 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $51.74 per share. 
Similar to our share repurchase -- purchases in recent years, it was a maintenance type action intended to partially offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.53. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.07. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $1.37. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.83 during the quarter -- third quarter to $38.77 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Most is when you drive around, and I'm sure above the highways, the number of deaths, well, the number of deaths on Ohio highways is up double digits this year. This is anecdotal to my way of description, but distracted driving, we believe, also has had some effect obviously not on the frequency but you had some situations whether or most skidmarks for somebody that's testing or talking on the phone house into someone. And so I think the industry is searching for a variety of things that are contributing to this, but I think it's not 1 thing, it's a lot of things."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another strong quarter.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Overall, it was another strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and independent agents. 
We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit and the ninth consecutive quarter in our streak of investment income growth. 
Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was slightly offset by less favorable weather-related catastrophe effects than in the third quarter of last year. In total, we achieved a third quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 87.8%. Our 9-month 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was also 87.8%, improving that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
Each of our major lines of business have performed well so far this year, except for commercial auto and personal auto. We continue to take action through better pricing precision and other initiatives for improved performance over time for our auto business. 
In late 2011, we established a long-term target of possibly reaching $5 billion in direct written premiums by the end of 2015. While it looks like we won't quite reach that level this year, we've often emphasized that we seek to grow only where we believe we can do so profitably. I'm pleased with our overall underwriting profitability so far this year and won't be disappointed if we don't write $5 billion in premium until 2016. 
Over the past 5 years or so, our premium growth has approximately doubled the U.S. P&C industry. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, including areas we've been emphasizing, such as personalized products and services for our agencies' higher-net-worth clients. 
Of the $16 million increase in 9-month new business written premiums for our personalized segment, nearly 20% of the increase was from high-net-worth policies. We launched Executive Capstone, our new suite of high-net-worth insurance products in New York during September. We expect those products to contribute significantly to profitable premium growth over time. 
We're on track with progress for an initiative we announced in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort and continues to develop a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to remain disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions. 
At September 30, we had entered into a handful of diverse treaties. If each treaty remains in effect for its full term and premiums that are subject to the risk we are reinsuring occur as anticipated, we estimate those treaties should generate approximately $30 million in premiums over the next year or so. Premiums losses and expenses recognized during the third quarter of 2015 for our reinsurance assumed program were each less than $500,000 and immaterial effect on results for the quarter. 
Turning to renewal policies. As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriter judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. Overall pricing for the third quarter was similar to the second quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the third quarter. 
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the third quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range. 
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers compensation, averaged slightly negative pricing during the quarter. While the average pricing change may have been negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. 
Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase received it. Our personal auto policies averaged renewal price increases near the low end of the mid-single-digit range while homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. For excess and surplus line segment, third quarter 2015 averaged renewal price percentage increases that were near the low end of the middle single-digit range. The E&S segment continues to perform very well, producing another quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premium. 
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter. Strong growth and profit in the third quarter drove our 9-month life insurance results above last year's. 
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, is by design long term in nature. We know that measure may sometimes fall below target in the short term due to securities market volatility. We are staying focused on underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business is in excellent shape, contributing more significantly to this year's 9-month value creation than a year ago. We have confidence in all of our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
I'd like to conclude by expressing my sympathy for those impacted by the flooding this fall. We sent a storm team of our own highly trained associates to South Carolina to meet face-to-face with policyholders, quickly beginning the recovery process. We currently estimate our total losses from that industry catastrophe event to reach between $4 million and $8 million. That's $4 million and $8 million. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that period w",732,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that period with a net unrealized gain of over $1.5 billion before taxes for our common stockholdings in total. 
We had another quarter of investment income growth, with an increase of 4%. All 50 common stocks in our core portfolio increased their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of October 2014 through September 2015. The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.6%. 
For our equity maturity portfolio, our -- I'm sorry, for our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to a 9-month 2015 net purchases totaling $486 million. The bond portfolio's third quarter 2015 pretax average yield, reported at 4.62%, was 14 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.64% while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.32%. In both cases, those yields are higher than we experienced a year ago. 
Our bond portfolio's effective duration as of September 30 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily -- due to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds, not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2015 rose 19% compared with a year ago to $755 million and helped generate $624 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. 
We're still carefully managing our expenses. Because we continue to strategically invest in our business, third quarter and 9-month property casualty underwriting expense ratios rose slightly compared with prior year periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
For the first 9 months of 2015, favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefit our combined ratio by 4.4 percentage points, slightly better than 3.9 points for the first 9 months of last year and in line with first half of this year. Although the commercial and personal auto, our major lines of businesses have developed favorably so far this year. For our auto lines, nearly 75% of the unfavorable reserve development was for accident years 2013 and 2014. Our 9-month 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 21% for accident year 2013, 29% for accident year 2012 and 9% for all order accident years in aggregate. 
Our capital strength remains excellent and includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at September 30 total just over $1.8 billion, up 1% from year-end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders. 
During the third quarter, we used $73 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $21 million to repurchase 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $51.74 per share. Similar to our share repurchase -- purchases in recent years, it was a maintenance-type action intended to partially offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.53. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.07. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $1.37. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.83 during the quarter -- third quarter to $38.77 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And so I think we're prepared to provide the kind of claims service that distinguishes us around the country as well. So it's been a good start. Obviously, we're not trying to explode on the scene. We're trying to do things the way we normally do it, slow and steady, but the appetite from an agency standpoint to do business with us has been great."

We provide a good option for our agencies. And so I think we can continue to be pretty choosy about what we write. And from the very beginning, Don has taken the approach that if we're -- being in this business, there are going to be times when you have to be tougher and maybe not grow as much, though I don't think we're at that point yet. But we've been able to continue, I think, growing it. We've had 61 consecutive months of rate increase, so I think that fortifies the results there.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another strong quarter.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Overall, it was another strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and independent agents. 
We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. Together, our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit and the ninth consecutive quarter in our streak of investment income growth. 
Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was slightly offset by less favorable weather-related catastrophe effects than in the third quarter of last year. In total, we achieved a third quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 87.8%. Our 9-month 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was also 87.8%, improving that ratio from both full year 2014 and 2013. 
Each of our major lines of business have performed well so far this year, except for commercial auto and personal auto. We continue to take action through better pricing precision and other initiatives for improved performance over time for our auto business. 
In late 2011, we established a long-term target of possibly reaching $5 billion in direct written premiums by the end of 2015. While it looks like we won't quite reach that level this year, we've often emphasized that we seek to grow only where we believe we can do so profitably. I'm pleased with our overall underwriting profitability so far this year and won't be disappointed if we don't write $5 billion in premium until 2016. 
Over the past 5 years or so, our premium growth has approximately doubled the U.S. P&C industry. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies, including the areas we've been emphasizing, such as personalized products and services for our agencies' higher-net-worth clients. 
Of the $16 million increase in 9-month new business written premiums for our personalized segment, nearly 20% of the increase was from high-net-worth policies. We launched Executive Capstone, our new suite of high-net-worth insurance products in New York during September. We expect those products to contribute significantly to profitable premium growth over time. 
We're on track with progress for an initiative we announced in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed, which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort and continues to develop a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to remain disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions. 
At September 30, we had entered into a handful of diverse treaties. If each treaty remains in effect for it's full term and premiums that are subject to the risk we are reinsuring occur as anticipated, we estimate those treaties should generate approximately $30 million in premiums over the next year or so. Premiums losses and expenses recognized during the third quarter of 2015 for our reinsurance assumed program were each less than $500,000 and immaterial effect on results for the quarter. 
Turning to renewal policies. As we further segment our business, we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriter judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. Overall pricing for the third quarter was similar to the second quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the third quarter. 
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the third quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range. 
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers' compensation, averaged slightly negative pricing during the quarter. While the average pricing change may have been negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. 
Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase received it. Our personal auto policies averaged renewal price increases near the low end of the mid-single-digit range while homeowner policies were a little higher in that range. For excess and surplus line segment, third quarter 2015 averaged renewal price percentage increases that were near the low end of the middle single-digit range. The E&S segment continues to perform very well, producing another quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premium. 
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from it's investment portfolio, also had another good quarter. Strong growth and profit in the third quarter drove our 9-month life insurance results above last year's. 
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, is by design long term in nature. We know that measure may sometimes fall below target in the short term due to securities and market volatility. We are staying focused on underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business is in excellent shape, contributing more significantly to this year's 9-month value creation than a year ago. We have confidence in all of our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. 
I'd like to conclude by expressing my sympathy for those impacted by the flooding this fall. We sent a storm team of our own highly trained associates to South Carolina to meet face-to-face with policyholders, quickly beginning the recovery process. We currently estimate our total losses from that industry catastrophe event to reach between $4 million and $8 million. That's $4 million and $8 million. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that period w",732,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
First, I'll highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that period with a net unrealized gain of over $1.5 billion before taxes for our common stockholdings in total. 
We had another quarter of investment income growth, with an increase of 4%. All 50 common stocks in our core portfolio increased their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of October 2014 through September 2015. The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.6%. 
For our equity maturity portfolio, our -- I'm sorry, for our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to a 9-month 2015 net purchases totaling $486 million. The bond portfolio's third quarter 2015 pretax average yield, reported at 4.62%, was 14 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.64% while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.32%. In both cases, those yields are higher than we experienced a year ago. 
Our bond portfolio's effective duration as of September 30 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end. The increase was due primarily -- due to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds, not a change in strategy. 
Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2015 rose 19% compared with a year ago to $755 million and helped generate $624 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. 
We're still carefully managing our expenses. Because we continue to strategically invest in our business, third quarter and 9-month property casualty underwriting expense ratios rose slightly compared with prior year periods. 
Moving to loss reserves. I'll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
For the first 9 months of 2015, favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.4 percentage points, slightly better than 3.9 points for the first 9 months of last year and in line with first half of this year. Other than commercial and personal auto, our major lines of businesses have developed favorably so far this year. For our auto lines, nearly 75% of the unfavorable reserve development was for accident years 2013 and 2014. Our 9-month 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 21% for accident year 2013, 29% for accident year 2012 and 9% for all order accident years in aggregate. 
Our capital strength remains excellent and includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at September 30 totaled just over $1.8 billion, up 1% from year-end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders. 
During the third quarter, we used $73 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $21 million to repurchase 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $51.74 per share. Similar to our share repurchase -- purchases in recent years, it was a maintenance-type action intended to partially offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. 
I'll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.53. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.07. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $1.37. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.83 during the quarter -- third quarter to $38.77 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And although the premiums are not always known on day 1, we estimate that we'll receive $32 million over the period compared to the $15 million that we reported at the end of the second quarter. So we basically have doubled that amount. The amounts that we've reported in the third quarter financials, though, are not material quite yet. When we write a contract, we may know what the entire premium -- or we may not know what the entire premium will be until the cedent actually cedes all the risk to us. So an example might be, say, if I use an example like workers' compensation in California, we may not know what the final premium on the specific contract will be until we know how much ultimately the cedent writes and cedes to us. So at any given point in time, it can be difficult to give a future written or earned number projections. So -- but what we've stated so far is we're going to walk, not run, as we build this business. And we're only going to take risk with superior returns that enhance our VCR.

I think we've just done -- the folks that are -- Don Doyle and the folks that are running E&S, who have just done a really good job of making certain that we're being thorough underwriters. And I think we've got a good opportunity within our agencies. Our agencies write ballpark $2.5 billion in E&S business in their agencies, and our model is unique. We provide a good option for our agencies. And so I think we can continue to be pretty choosy about what we write. And from the very beginning, Don has taken the approach that if we're -- being in this business, there are going to be times when you have to be tougher and maybe not grow as much, though I don't think we're at that point yet. But we've been able to continue, I think, growing it. We've had 61 consecutive months of rate increase, so I think that fortifies the results there.

The American Truckers Association (sic) [American Trucking Association] just, I guess, by way of a comment said that by -- at the end of 2014, there was a shortage of 38,000 drivers.

But it's -- even in Ohio, which is our -- it's gold-standard state as far as profitability. It's been a little tougher here in Ohio. We noticed on -- when you drive around -- I'm sure in your area, and they have signs above the highway that says the number of deaths, well, the number of deaths on Ohio highways is up double digits this year. This is anecdotal to -- by way of a description, but distracted driving, we believe, also has had some effect. Obviously not on the frequency, but you had some situations where there were no skid marks, and somebody that was texting or talking on the phone piles into someone.
