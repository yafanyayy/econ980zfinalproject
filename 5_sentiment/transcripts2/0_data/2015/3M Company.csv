For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere in all business groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future. 
I'll take you through a few numbers. Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales was $7.7 billion, a fourth quarter record. Organic growth company-wide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. And of our 4 business groups, Health Care, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Consumer each grew a solid 6%. We saw organic growth in every geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States, that marked its strongest growth of the year. Latin America/Canada grew 9%, while Europe/Middle East/Africa grew 3%. 
Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a stronger U.S. dollar which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%, yet, we still delivered good top and bottom line growth. Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated a strong cash flow with a conversion rate of 144%. This allowed us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and in December, we announced a 20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014. 
Overall, we finished the year strong, and I thank the entire 3M team for their hard work and execution. Nick will now go through the details. Nick?"

This was our stron",1540,"Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our fourth quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 6.3%, with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up 0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to growth and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013. Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America/Canada, where Electronics and Energy, Health Care and Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter and Brazil was up slightly. Asia Pacific grew 6.9%, Safety and Graphics and Health Care led the way, with growth of 12% and 9% respectively. Organic growth was 9% in Japan or 4% excluding electronics. China/Hong Kong grew 4% or 6%, excluding electronics. The United States grew 6.6% led by industrial at 10%, Health Care, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%. EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter. Central East Europe and Middle East/Africa each grew double digits, while West Europe grew 1%. EMEA economies remain soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in 4 of our 5 businesses led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights, fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year, with 6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar. Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year while continuing to invest for the future. I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating margins and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points. Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses, supported by technology innovation, brand and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter, commodity prices declined as we closed out Q4, and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs and restructuring. During Q4, we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive. Finally, productivity resulted in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year. Earnings were $1.81 per share, an increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging, reduced earnings by $0.05 a share given the broad-based strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added $0.01 to per share earnings, and average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share. 
Now I'll review cash flow performance on Slide #6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4, with 144% conversion versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million, driven by multiple factors, including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free cash flow conversion. We continue to manage toward a better-optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage which we are using for 2 purposes, first, to invest in our businesses; and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business organically. We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a reminder, on December 16, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of buybacks, growth share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. Net debt at the end of December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2013. 
Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups, starting with Industrial on Slide 7. Industrial, with sales of $2.6 billion, delivered strong organic local currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced materials led the way, with double-digit growth. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation business generated high single-digit growth, and we also saw strong growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and auto OEM. All regions delivered growth for industrial, paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad based, with notable performances in the 3 industrial heartland businesses, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Latin America/Canada grew 6% followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%. Operating income was $538 million and operating margins were 20.5%, down 90 basis points versus last year's all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year, including efforts to better-optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in line with normal seasonal trends, and for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013. 
Let's now look at Health Care on Slide 8. Health Care delivered another very good quarter, with sales of $1.4 billion and organic growth of over 6%. Every Health Care business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care, posted strong growth in the quarter. Health information systems and food safety each grew double digits. Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas led by Latin America/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The U.S. grew 7% and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 15% organically, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high priority investment area of ours for some time, and these investments are paying off. We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future. Operating income was $431 million and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business continues to exceed sales and profit objectives. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Electronics and Energy continue to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%. Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the quarter and for the year. Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our electronics-related businesses as we continue to see strong end customer demand enhanced by spec in wins at several OEMs. In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales increased 2%. Electrical Markets business was up high single digits, while Renewable Energy and Telecom both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America/Canada; 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter's sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organically. Personal Safety grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand for 3M Safety Solutions in the manufacturing sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China where air quality is an ongoing concern. We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4 sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, commercial solutions group mid-single digits and organic sales declined slightly in granules and traffic safety and security. Asia Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety. Growth was 10% in Latin America/Canada, 9% in EMEA and 7% in the United States. Operating income was $285 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity. 
I'll finish with the Consumer Business Group found on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of nearly 6%. All 4 businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double-digit increase in do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace, with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. We also saw good growth in Consumer Health Care with notable strength in our Futuro-branded health supports. Looking by geography, U.S. organic growth was 7% boosted by a strong holiday sell-in of Scotch and other 3M branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America/Canada and 5% in Asia Pacific. EMEA declined 1% year-on-year. Operating income increased 12% to $254 million, and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continue to drive efficiencies across the business. 
That wraps up my review of the quarter. I'll hand it back over to Inge."

The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we delivered a record $32 billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area, with a good balance between developed and developing markets. We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. We also made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our investor meeting here on St. Paul on November 8, 2012. On earnings per share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS 11.5%. On organic growth, our target was 4% to 6%, we grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014, we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%. 
Driving our success is the scale of our people and the strengths of our business model which includes 3 key levers. The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 27. In 2014, we combined businesses within 3 of our business groups, Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Industrial. All in, we invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success. We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A. In 2014, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions, including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We also just recently divested our static control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for 3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity. 
Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M's primary growth strategy is organic and we strive to develop unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. This is why research and development is the heartbeat of our company. In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strengths of our innovation engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also earned more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our history, we have now earned more than 100,000 patents globally. 
The third lever is business transformation. At our investor meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create the more ideal and efficient 3M, and allow us to better serve customers around the world. 
Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these 3 levers is considering to drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015. 
Please turn to Slide 13, and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30. Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger currency headwinds than expected in December. We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%. However, it's evident in our fourth quarter and full year result, we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input costs lower versus one-month ago, and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate estimates remains at 28% to 29%, with free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. 
As you can see, we look forward to another strong and successful year. And with that, I thank you for your attention, and we now welcome your questions."

First of all, I am, we are pleased to see the momentum that has build over many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth and for me specifically why that is encouraging is we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States, but also outside of the United States to make sure we're becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers. And I think that is what we see paying off. And it's broad based. And I think that is also related to -- we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the 5 business groups, we're very diversified from a business group perspective, and we are very diversified geographically as well, with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it's very nice to see it all coming together for us. When we look upon the results for the quarter and then look out the range for 2015, there are no change in the range for us. We still believe we had in United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for '15, 3 to 6 in the range. We believe that will be in the high end of that range in my mind as we sit here today doing very, very well. APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit, both in China for us and in Southeast Asia, and Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look at that in terms of our range for the year, we believe Asia is 3 to 7, China probably 4 to 10, and Japan, a little bit lower. So there is a good market condition for us in order to be able to grow. Latin America as you saw came back -- Latin America/Canada came back this quarter, and we talked about that at the last call where we said see 5% 8% for them as we roll into the year and we're still sticking with that. Brazil was slightly positive, Mexico did very, very well. So I think when you look at North America, U.S., Canada, Mexico has a very good growth momentum for us. And then West Europe, we would say as we said before, a little bit of a question mark. We had that in the range of minus 2 to plus 2 for the year. We had growth of 1 percentage point in West Europe and Europe/Middle East/Africa, 3 for the quarter. And then as we produce quite a bit in those countries in terms of export, that should not be too negative for us as we move ahead. And as you know, it's not only that the research and development, which is driving organic local currency growth, by the way, but also the strategy we have had around domestic business models should play for us here. When you asked about market share and so forth, we have many businesses so it's difficult to go through all of them, but when I look upon it, it's clear that we're taking market share in many of our businesses."

Our approach in managing that is really unchanged, and it's on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges. And that has been demonstrated time after time. We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure. And we hedged that out in the past for 12 months. As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenure out to 24 months for some of the currencies and some of the developed countries we're in such as euro and yen. And then operationally, some of the things we do to manage that exposure is looking for opportunities in sources of supply, and in some cases, raising prices to offset that currency or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency such as the U.S. dollar. And as much of the story we've had in the past and it remains the same in 2015. On your question on Switzerland, we have minimal cost exposure there and that will have an immaterial impact on our results in 2015."

So I'll use the Eurozone right now, where we have a European center of excellence that's looking at what kind of opportunities do we have with the current FX rates on the euro. Looking at our material costs, are there potentials to renegotiate purchase prices? Material localization, does it create new opportunities for us to source something from a new supplier at a different FX exchange-rate to our advantage? In times like this, it also causes us to manage our spending probably more tightly in some parts of the world. And then to what you were talking this is a little longer-term looking at regional sales sufficiency. We do have manufacturing capability to manufacture products that is spread around the world, and then we use movements like this to look for those opportunities.

The restructuring actions we're taking in the United States, we see paybacks occurring within the next calendar year or less than 12 months.

And I would say that specifically, we had good growth in some of the businesses that are specific around automotive and so forth which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in Personal Safety which is very much related in to the industrial space. So it's still a slow growth generally speaking over there, but I think personally with the trend relative to the currency, that we will see more exports coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong, I would say, in our industrial position and in Health Care. We are weaker in the consumer space in Europe based on historical position. So I think as export will increase as we go, I think that will help 3M as we go ahead. I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years, I think 4 years, relative to the structure over there. So I think one of the thing -- sometimes it's difficult to predict exactly the outcome of the growth, but I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure constantly. And as we have talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary structure to regional structure and taking all out quite a bit of layers and management into the organization while we kept the front end of the organization in terms of the execution. So let's say, I think we are in a good place in Europe but it's not an easy environment, that as we all know. But there's no disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in industrial, Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us -- our Electronics and Energy and consumer businesses have a smaller mix in Europe, and I would say specifically consumer electronics is very small in Europe. We are strong in Energy. Consumer Retail is, by definition, is a small portion for us. And I think in that segment also where you will see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead."

For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere, in all business groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future. 
I'll take you through a few numbers. Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales were $7.7 billion, a fourth quarter record. Organic growth company-wide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. Our other 4 business groups, Health Care, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Consumer each grew a solid 6%. We saw organic growth in every geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States, that marked its strongest growth of the year. Latin America/Canada grew 9%, while Europe/Middle East/Africa grew 3%. 
Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%. Yet, we still delivered good top and bottom line growth. Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated strong cash flow with a conversion rate of 144%. This allowed us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in December, we announced a 20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014. 
Overall, we finished the year strong, and I thank the entire 3M team for their hard work and execution. Nick will now go through the details. Nick?"

Worldwide organic local currency growth was 6.3% with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up 0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to growth and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013. Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America/Canada where Electronics and Energy, Health Care and Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter and Brazil was up slightly. Asia Pacific grew 6.9%, Safety and Graphics and Health Care led the way with growth of 12% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth was 9% in Japan or 4% excluding Electronics. China/Hong Kong grew 4% or 6% excluding Electronics. The United States grew 6.6% led by Industrial at 10%. Health Care, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%. EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa each grew double digits while West Europe grew 1%. EMEA economies remained soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in 4 of our 5 businesses, led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter. 
Turn to Slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year, with 6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar. Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year while continuing to invest for the future. 
I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points. Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses, supported by technology innovation, brand and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter, commodity prices declined as we closed out Q4 and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs and restructuring. During Q4, we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points, and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive. Finally, productivity resulted in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year. 
Earnings were $1.81 per share, an increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced earnings by $0.05 a share given the broad-based strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added $0.01 to per-share earnings. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share. 
Now I'll review cash flow performance on Slide #6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4 with 144% conversion versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million, driven by multiple factors, including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free cash flow conversion. 
We continue to manage toward a better-optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage, which we are using for 2 purposes: first, to invest in our businesses; and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business organically. 
We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a reminder, on December 16, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of buybacks, gross share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. 
Net debt at the end of December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year-end 2013. 
Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups starting with Industrial on Slide 7. Industrial, with sales of $2.6 billion, delivered strong organic local currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced materials led the way with double-digit growth. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation business generated high single-digit growth. And we also saw strong growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and auto OEM. 
All regions delivered growth for Industrial, paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad based with notable performances in the 3 Industrial Heartland businesses: industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Latin America/Canada grew 6% followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%. 
Operating income was $538 million and operating margins were 20.5%, down 90 basis points versus last year's all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year, including efforts to better optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in line with normal seasonal trends, and for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013. 
Let's now look at Health Care on Slide 8. Health Care delivered another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion and organic growth of over 6%. Every Health Care business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical businesses, namely, infection prevention and critical and chronic care, posted strong growth in the quarter. Health information systems and food safety each grew double digits. Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas led by Latin America/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The U.S. grew 7% and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 15% organically, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time and these investments are paying off. We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future. 
Operating income was $431 million and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business continues to exceed sales and profit objectives. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Electronics and Energy continued to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%. 
Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the quarter and for the year. Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our Electronics-related businesses as we continue to see strong end customer demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs. 
In our Energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales increased 2%. The Electrical Markets business was up high single digits while renewable energy and telecom both declined year-on-year. 
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter's sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organically. Personal safety grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand for 3M safety solutions in the manufacturing sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China where air quality is an ongoing concern. We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4 sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, commercial solutions group mid-single digits and organic sales declined slightly in roofing granules and traffic safety and security. 
Asia Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety. Growth was 10% in Latin America/Canada, 9% in EMEA and 7% in the United States. 
Operating income was $285 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity. 
I'll finish with the Consumer Business Group found on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of nearly 6%. All 4 businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double-digit increase in Do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. We also saw good growth in consumer health care with notable strength in our Futuro-branded health supports. 
Looking by geography. U.S. organic growth was 7%, boosted by a strong holiday sell-in of Scotch and other 3M-branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America/Canada and 5% in Asia Pacific. EMEA declined 1% year-on-year. 
Operating income increased 12% to $254 million and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continue to drive efficiencies across the business. 
That wraps up my review of the quarter. I'll hand it back to Inge."

The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we delivered a record $32 billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area with a good balance between developed and developing markets. We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. 
We also made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our investor meeting here on St. Paul on November 8, 2012. On earnings per share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS 11.5%. On organic growth, our target was 4% to 6%. We grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014, we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%. 
Driving our success is the skill of our people and the strengths of our business model, which includes 3 key levers. The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 27. In 2014, we combined businesses within 3 of our business groups: Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Industrial. All in, we invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success. 
We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A. In 2014, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions, including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We also just recently divested our strategic -- Static Control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for 3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity. 
Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M's primary growth strategy is organic and we strive to develop unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. This is why research and development is the heartbeat of our company. In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strengths of our innovation engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also earned more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our history, we have now earned more than 100,000 patents globally. 
The third lever is business transformation. At our investor meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create the more ideal and efficient 3M and allow us to better serve customers around the world. 
Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these 3 levers is continuing to drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015. 
Please turn to Slide 13 and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30. Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger currency headwinds than expected in December. We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%. However, it's evident in our fourth quarter and full year result we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input costs lower versus one month ago and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate estimates remain at 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. 
As you can see, we look forward to another strong and successful year. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we now welcome your questions."

First of all, I am -- we are pleased to see the momentum that has built over many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth.

First of all, I am -- we are pleased to see the momentum that has built over many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth. And for me, specifically, why that is very encouraging is that we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States, but also outside of United States to make sure we're becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers. And I think that is what we see paying off. And it's broad based. And I think that is also related to -- we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the 5 business groups, we're very diversified from a business group perspective and we are very diversified geographically as well with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it's very nice to see it all coming together for us. When we look upon the results for the quarter and then look out to the range for 2015, there are no change in the range for us. We still believe -- we had a -- in United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for '15, 3% to 6% in the range. So we believe that we'll be on the high end of that range in my mind as we sit here today, doing very, very well. APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit, both in China for us and in Southeast Asia, and Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look up on that in terms of our range for the year, we believe Asia is 3% to 7%, China is probably 4% to 10% and Japan a little bit lower. So there is a good market condition for us in order to be able to grow. Latin America, as you saw, came back and -- Latin America/Canada came back this quarter and we talked about that at the last call where we said see 5% to 8% for them as we roll into the year and we're still sticking with that. Brazil was slightly positive. Mexico did very, very well. So I think when you look upon North America, U.S., Canada, Mexico, has a very good growth momentum for us. And then West Europe, we would say, as we said before, a little bit of a question mark. We have had that in the range of minus 2% to plus 2% for the year. We had growth of 1 percentage point in West Europe. Europe/Middle East/Africa, 3% for the quarter. And then as we produce quite a bit in those countries in terms of export, that should not be too negative for us as we move ahead. And as you know, it's not only that the research and development, which is driving organic local currency growth, by the way, but also the strategy we have had around domestic business models should play for us here. So when you asked about market share and so forth, we have many businesses so it's difficult to go through all of them, but when I look upon it, it is clear that we take market share in many of our businesses."

With the movement in the foreign exchange rates that we've seen in the last month, we now put ourselves right at the high end of that range as hurting 3M's earnings per share by $0.20 year-on-year. Our approach in managing that is really unchanged and it's on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges and that has been demonstrated time-after-time. We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure and we hedged that out in the past for 12 months. As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenure out to 24 months for some of the currencies in developed -- some of the developed countries we're in such as euro and yen. And then operationally, some of the things we do to manage that exposure is looking for opportunities in sources of supply, and in some cases, raising prices to offset that currency or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency such as the U.S. dollar. And as much of the story we've had in the past and it remains the same in 2015. As far as your question on Switzerland, we have minimal cost exposure there and that will have an immaterial impact on our results in 2015."

In times like this, it also causes us to manage our spending probably more tightly in some parts of the world.

If I give you some facts relative to that additional 5% -- or from 5.5% to 6% increase in spending is around disruptive technologies and this is now going into the third year. So overall, we have 30 programs that are funded. 19 of them came on in 2013, 7 in 2014 and we are looking for another 4 here in 2015. So the investment over the years have been 82 in '14 and was 40 in '13 and we plan for another 70-plus this year. Seven of the programs are now in early stage of commercialization and that's in Health Care, Infrastructure and transportation, electronics and consumer markets. So we had sales from those investment in 2014 for around $150 million and we are looking, as I said, in New York, for around $250 million as we go ahead. So we will continue to invest and our, as we had talked about in the past, our New Product Vitality Index is robust, 32%, 33%, that's a good place for us to be, and we are continuing to invest in. Now the investment going into it is important, but equally important for me is to see the outcome. And I'm pleased by that because, as you see, we are running in the middle of a range of 4% to 6% now -- or running around 5%, in fact, this quarter on the high end of that range. And that is clear evidence that new programs are being introduced as we grow. And we had quite a number of new product introduced in 2014 that hit the market. So it was $10.4 billion on new products hitting the market from 3M 2014. So I'm not -- we will continue to invest, but they are not excluded from productivity improvements."

And if we go over 50% in most cases, we would then be subject to mark-to-market accounting and therefore defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do with our hedging process. In fact, we'd probably add more volatility if we did that. So that's the upper limit constraint on what we can. And part of our approach, if I go back over a decade, is not to eliminate all the risks there. Our approach is to give the business some time to react and adjust to the changing business conditions and that's consistent with our 50% strategy."

And I would say that, specifically, we had good growth in some of the businesses that are specific around automotive and so forth, which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in personal safety, which is very much related into the Industrial space. So it's still a slow growth generally speaking over there, but I think personally with the trend relative to the currency, that we will see more exports coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong, I will say, in our Industrial position and in Health Care. We are weaker in the Consumer space in Europe based on historical position. So I think as export will increase as we go, I think that will help 3M as we go ahead. I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say that we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years, I think 4 years, relative to the structure over there. So I think one of the thing that sometimes is difficult to predict exactly the outcome of the growth, but I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure constantly. And as we had talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary structure to regional structure and taking all out quite a bit of layers and management in the organization while we kept the front end of the organization in terms of execution. So let's say, I think we are in a good place in Europe, but it's not an easy environment, as we all know, but there's no disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in Industrial, Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us. Our Electronics and Energy and Consumer businesses have a smaller mix in Europe and I would say specifically consumer Electronics is very small in Europe. We are strong in Energy. Consumer retail is, by definition, a small portion for us so -- and I think in that segment also where you will see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead."

For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere, in all business groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future. 
I'll take you through a few numbers. Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales were $7.7 billion, a fourth quarter record. Organic growth company-wide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. Our other 4 business groups, Health Care, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Consumer each grew a solid 6%. We saw organic growth in every geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States, that marked its strongest growth of the year. Latin America/Canada grew 9%, while Europe/Middle East/Africa grew 3%. 
Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%. Yet, we still delivered good top and bottom line growth. Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated strong cash flow with a conversion rate of 144%. This allowed us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in December, we announced a 20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014. 
Overall, we finished the year strong, and I thank the entire 3M team for their hard work and execution. Nick will now go through the details. Nick?"

Worldwide organic local-currency growth was 6.3% with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up 0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to growth, and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013. Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America/Canada where Electronics and Energy, Health Care and Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter, and Brazil was up slightly. Asia Pacific grew 6.9%, Safety and Graphics and Health Care led the way with growth of 12% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth was 9% in Japan or 4% excluding Electronics. China/Hong Kong grew 4% or 6% excluding Electronics. The United States grew 6.6% led by Industrial at 10%. Health Care, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%. EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa each grew double digits while West Europe grew 1%. EMEA economies remained soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in 4 of our 5 businesses, led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter. 
Turn to Slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year, with 6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar. Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year while continuing to invest for the future. 
I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points. Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses, supported by technology innovation, brand and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter, commodity prices declined as we closed out Q4, and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs and restructuring. During Q4, we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points, and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive. Finally, productivity resulted in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year. 
Earnings were $1.81 per share, an increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced earnings by $0.05 a share given the broad-based strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added $0.01 to per-share earnings. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share. 
Now I'll review cash flow performance on Slide #6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4 with 144% conversion versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million, driven by multiple factors, including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free cash flow conversion. 
We continue to manage toward a better-optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage, which we are using for 2 purposes: first, to invest in our businesses; and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business organically. 
We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a reminder, on December 16, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of buybacks, gross share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. 
Net debt at the end of December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year-end 2013. 
Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups starting with Industrial on Slide 7. Industrial, with sales of $2.6 billion, delivered strong organic local-currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced materials led the way with double-digit growth. Our aerospace and commercial transportation business generated high single-digit growth. And we also saw strong growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and auto OEM. 
All regions delivered growth for Industrial, paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad-based with notable performances in the 3 Industrial Heartland businesses: industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Latin America/Canada grew 6% followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%. 
Operating income was $538 million and operating margins were 20.5%, down 90 basis points versus last year's all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year, including efforts to better optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in line with normal seasonal trends. And for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013. 
Let's now look at Health Care on Slide 8. Health Care delivered another very good quarter, with sales of $1.4 billion and organic growth of over 6%. Every Health Care business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical businesses, namely, infection prevention and critical and chronic care, posted strong growth in the quarter. Health information systems and food safety each grew double digits. Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Latin America/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The U.S. grew 7%, and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets Health Care grew 15% organically, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, and these investments are paying off. We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future. 
Operating income was $431 million, and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations, and the business continues to exceed sales and profit objectives. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Electronics and Energy continued to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%. 
Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the quarter and for the year. Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our Electronics-related businesses as we continue to see strong end customer demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs. 
In our Energy-related businesses, organic local-currency sales increased 2%. The Electrical Markets business was up high single digits while renewable energy and telecom both declined year-on-year. 
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organically. Personal safety grew double digits as we continued to see strong demand for 3M safety solutions in the manufacturing sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4 sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, commercial solutions grew mid-single digits, and organic sales declined slightly in roofing granules and traffic safety and security. 
Asia Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety. Growth was 10% in Latin America/Canada, 9% in EMEA and 7% in the United States. 
Operating income was $285 million, and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity. 
I'll finish with the Consumer Business Group found on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of nearly 6%. All 4 businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double-digit increase in Do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. We also saw good growth in consumer health care with notable strength in our Futuro-branded health supports. 
Looking by geography, U.S. organic growth was 7%, boosted by a strong holiday sell-in of Scotch and other 3M-branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America/Canada and 5% in Asia Pacific. EMEA declined 1% year-on-year. 
Operating income increased 12% to $254 million, and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continued to drive efficiencies across the business.

The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we delivered a record $32 billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area with a good balance between developed and developing markets. We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. 
We also made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our investor meeting here in St. Paul on November 8, 2012. On earnings per share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS 11.5%. On organic growth, our target is 4% to 6%. We grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014, we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%. 
Driving our success is the skill of our people and the strengths of our business model, which includes 3 key levers. The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 27. In 2014, we combined businesses within 3 of our business groups: Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Industrial. All in, we invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success. 
We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A. In 2014, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions, including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We also just recently divested our strategic -- Static Control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for 3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity. 
Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M's primary growth strategy is organic, and we strive to develop unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. This is why research and development is the heartbeat of our company. In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strengths of our innovation engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also earned more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our history, we have now earned more than 100,000 patents globally. 
The third lever is business transformation. At our investor meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create a more agile and efficient 3M and allow us to better serve customers around the world. 
Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these 3 levers is continuing to drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015. 
Please turn to Slide 13, and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30. Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger currency headwinds than expected in December. We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%. However, as evident in our fourth quarter and full year result we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input costs lower versus one month ago, and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate estimates remain at 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. 
As you can see, we look forward to another strong and successful year. And with that, I thank you for your attention, and we now welcome your questions."

First of all, I am -- we are pleased to see the momentum that has built over many quarters now relative to organic local-currency growth. And for me, specifically, why that is very encouraging is that we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States, but also outside of United States to make sure we're becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers. And I think that is what we see paying off. And it's broad-based. And I think that is also related to -- we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the 5 business groups, we're very diversified from a business group perspective, and we are very diversified geographically as well with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it's very nice to see it all coming together for us. When we looked upon the results for the quarter and then look out to the range for 2015, there are no change in the range for us. We still believe -- we had a -- in United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for '15, 3% to 6% in the range. So we believe that we'll be on the high end of that range in my mind as we sit here today, doing very, very well. APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit, both in China for us and in Southeast Asia, and Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look upon that in terms of a range for the year, we believe Asia is 3% to 7%, China is probably 4% to 10% and Japan a little bit lower. So there is a good market condition for us in order to be able to grow. Latin America, as you saw, came back and -- Latin America/Canada came back this quarter, and we talked about that at the last call where we said see 5% to 8% for them as we roll into the year. And we're still sticking with that. Brazil was slightly positive. Mexico did very, very well. So I think when you look upon North America, U.S., Canada, Mexico, has a very good growth momentum for us. And then West Europe, we would say, as we said before, a little bit of a question mark. We have had that in the range of minus 2% to plus 2% for the year. We had growth of 1 percentage point in West Europe. Europe/Middle East/Africa, 3% for the quarter. And then as we produce quite a bit in those countries in terms of export, that should not be too negative for us as we move ahead. And as you know, it's not only that the research and development -- which is driving organic local-currency growth, by the way -- but also the strategy we have had around domestic business models should play for us here. So when you ask about market share and so forth, we have many businesses so it's difficult to go through all of them. But when I look upon it, it is clear that we take market share in many of our businesses."

With the movement in the foreign exchange rates that we've seen in the last month, we now put ourselves right at the high end of that range, as hurting 3M's earnings per share by $0.20 year-on-year. Our approach in managing that is really unchanged, and it's on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges, and that has been demonstrated time-after-time. We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure. And we hedged that out in the past for 12 months. As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenor out to 24 months for some of the currencies in developed -- some of the developed countries we're in, such as euro and yen. And then operationally, some of the things we do to manage that exposure is looking for opportunities in sources of supply and, in some cases, raising prices to offset that currency, or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency, such as the U.S. dollar. And that's much of the story we've had in the past, and it remains the same in 2015. As far as your question on Switzerland, we have minimal cost exposure there, and that will have an immaterial impact on our results in 2015."

So I'll use the Eurozone right now where we have a European center of excellence that's looking at what kinds of opportunities do we have with the current FX rates on the euro; looking at our material costs, are there potentials to renegotiate purchase prices; material localization, is there -- does it create new opportunities for us to source something from a new supplier at a different FX exchange rate to our advantage? In times like this, it also causes us to manage our spending probably more tightly in some parts of the world. And then to what you were talking, that's a little longer term, looking at regional self-sufficiency. We do have manufacturing capability to manufacture products that is spread around the world.

If I were you modeling, I would not be modeling that same ratio of pricing action to offset that. The businesses are out there engaged, working on where the opportunities are for offsetting some of that FX in price. But the ratios that we've experienced in the past are not going to be the same as what we're going to see in Western Europe. There are some parts of EMEA, though, where we are changing our pricing to be U.S. dollar-priced, which will bolster our price growth there. But the guidance I give, Steve, is, temper that ratio that you've historically seen."

I think one important thing is to just recognize the investments that we have done over years under the umbrella of domestic demand and domestic manufacturing, which is helping you a lot relative to issues like this. I think the other thing is the technology innovation will, by definition, in most businesses, help you. And the way we look upon our business, we have one that I will describe as a design and spec-in business and then you have one on consumables. On design and spec-in businesses, where you provide technology innovation that is coming on platforms, that's a big advantage for us. Because the technology is there. And in most cases we are able to produce locally. So another thing is over 1/3 of our business is in United States. And as I've said before, 3M never left United States. We stayed here. In fact, we have also invested this year in more capacity, specifically in our Health Care business. So I see, in terms of some competitive moves, yes, from time-to-time, there can be, in my view, in smaller countries around the world, maybe some push in the low end of the portfolio from some local competitors. But I think that's not what 3M is all about based on our business model generally speaking. So we should be able to hold in there and, as I said, probably gain market share as we move ahead, right. I am, generally speaking, very, very pleased with the execution relative to our commercialization capabilities in the company. And I'm very pleased to see how that momentum have built now for 5, 6 quarters, slightly stronger every quarter. So that's good."

If I give you some facts relative to that additional 5% -- or from 5.5% to 6% increase in spending is around disruptive technologies. And this is now going into the third year. So overall, we have 30 programs that are funded. 19 of them came on in 2013, 7 in 2014, and we are looking for another 4 here in 2015. So the investment over the years have been 82 in '14 and was 40 in '13 and we plan for another 70-plus this year. Seven of the programs are now in early stage of commercialization, and that's in Health Care, infrastructure and transportation, Electronics and Consumer markets. So we had sales from those investment in 2014 for around $150 million and we are looking, as I said in New York, for around $250 million as we go ahead. So we will continue to invest and our, as we had talked about in the past, our New Product Vitality Index is robust, 32%, 33%, that's a good place for us to be. And we are continuing to invest in. Now the investment going into it is important, but equally important for me is to see the outcome. And I'm pleased by that because, as you see, we are running in the middle of a range of 4% to 6% now. Running around 5%, in fact, this quarter on the high end of that range. And that is clear evidence that new programs are being introduced as we grow. And we had quite a number of new product introduced in 2014 that hit the market.

And I would say that, specifically, we had good growth in some of the businesses that -- specific around automotive and so forth, which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in personal safety, which is very much related in to the Industrial space. So it's still a slow growth generally speaking over there. But I think personally with the trend relative to the currency that we will see more exports coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong, I will say, in our Industrial position and in Health Care. We are weaker in the Consumer space in Europe based on historical position. So I think as export will increase as we go, I think that will help 3M as we go ahead. I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say that we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years, I think 4 years, relative to the structure over there. So I think one of the thing that sometimes is difficult to predict exactly the outcome of the growth, but I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure constantly. And as we had talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary structure to regional structure and taking all out quite a bit of layers and management in the organization while we kept the front end of the organization in terms of execution. So let's say, I think we are in a good place in Europe. But it's not an easy environment, as we all know, but there's no disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in Industrial, Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us. Our Electronics and Energy and Consumer businesses have a smaller mix in Europe. And I would say specifically consumer Electronics is very small in Europe. We are strong in Energy. Consumer retail is, by definition, a small portion for us so -- and I think in that segment also where you will see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead."

I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved this against a more challenging first quarter economic backdrop. 
The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition, global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures.
As 3M always does, we continue to manage 2 things within our control: Execute our plan and build for the future. I'll take you through the first quarter highlights.
Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%. For the seventh consecutive quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group, as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against the number of currencies reducing sales by 6.5%.
We expanded company-wide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year. And all business groups delivered margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions over the last 3 years are paying off.
This quarter, 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio. We announced plans to acquire Polypore Separation's media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. 
Last month, we completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business. And at the same time, we completed the sales of our Static Control business in January.
Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we increased the first quarter dividend by 20%, on top of a 35% increase last year.
Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

As Inge mentioned, in the quarter, we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worl",2113,"Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our first quarter sales change. As Inge mentioned, in the quarter, we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3% with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%. 2 Health Care related acquisitions, namely Treo solutions and Ivera Medical, added 10 basis points to growth. This impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points.
The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of 2014. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing a trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen declined 14% and the Brazilian real, 19%.
Looking more closely at organic local currency growth. Asia Pacific lead the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8%, and Electronics and Energy at 7%. Organic growth was 7% in China/Hong Kong or 8% excluding electronics, similar to recent quarters.
Japan was up against a challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year, leading up to the April 1, 2014 consumption tax increase. EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter, with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up mid single-digits and middle East Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1%, respectively.
We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America/Canada, where industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil was down 2%. The United States grew 3.1% organically with industrial, Health Care and consumer each growing 4%, Safety and Graphics and outrunning synergy each grew 3%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating income, on the other hand, increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share.
Early in the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place, and we executed those plans as Q1 played out. Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by 90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1 percentage point. Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement.
Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion. We continued to generate positive selling price changes across our businesses, boosted by 3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business model.
In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum as the year progresses.
Productivity added 30 basis points to margins, as spending remained under good control in the quarter and foreign currency impacts, net of hedge gains, were neutral to margins.
First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continue to make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs, along with business transformation and ERP. These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a result of the adoption of new mortality tables, along with a lower discount rate.
Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point.
Now let's take -- turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $90 million or the equivalent of $0.10 a share.
The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05. The increase was due to geographic mix, which was influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a one-time benefit that did not repeat. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share.
Now let's review cash flow performance on Slide #7. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million, consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
First quarter free cash flow was $789 million, and we converted 66% of net income to cash in line with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continue to expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%.
As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter, and we continue to plan $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year. Now let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #8.
Industrial, with sales of $2.7 billion, delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation, Automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses all generated high single-digit growth. We also posted positive organic growth in Advanced Materials and in Industrial, adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada set the pace with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%, Asia Pacific increased 3% and EMEA was flat.
We continue to invest for the future within industrial. During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of MicroProse membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company.
Wrapping up on Industrial's first quarter performance. Operating income was $598 million. And operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's Q1. Now let's turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 9. 
First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4% organically. Personnel safety grew high single-digits in the quarter. Worker safety remains high priority for manufacturers globally, and we are gaining share.
In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security each posted positive organic growth, while ripping granules declined year-on-year.
Asia Pacific delivered 9% organic growth, Latin America/Canada increased 5%, the U.S. was up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million, and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continued to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on prioritization and portfolio management.
Let's now turn to Health Care on Slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%. Growth was strongest in food, safety, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Our infection prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business declined year-over-year. Geographically, organic growth in Asia Pacific was 8%, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%. EMEA declined 1%.
In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, as health care markets rapidly evolve in developing countries.
In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's vascular access product offerings to health care facilities. Integration is going smoothly, and we look forward to expanding this business globally. Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remained strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were 31.1%.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local currency growth in the first quarter with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local currency sales grew 12% in our Electronics-related businesses, as we continue to see strong consumer demand enhanced by spec in wins at several OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales declined 3%. The Electrical Markets business was flat, while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics And Energy increased 7% in Asia Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both the U.S. and Latin America/Canada.
The divestiture of the Static Control business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014. 
Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $283 million, and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities and contributing to higher productivity and margins.
Please turn to Slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion with organic growth of 2%. All 4 businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by do-it-yourself and home care, each growing mid single-digits. Looking by geography, the U.S. grew 4% and Asia Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America/Canada declined slightly year-on-year. Operating income increased to $240 million, and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on productivity programs.
Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on corporate and unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension postretirement expenses being the primary reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate corporate and unallocated net expense to be approximately $400 million.
That wraps up our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, where we address our full year planning estimates. On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales by 8%. 
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share versus a previous estimate of $8 to $8.30 per share. In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course, since then, the dollar has strengthened further.
Today, we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share or an incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates.
These figures are net of hedging. 
For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share. For the tax rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate.
Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year. I'll now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments."

We executed our playbook and delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now more than ever, our teams remain keenly focused on efficient growth, focused both on organic growth and, of course, productivity.
As Nick described, we also took a number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic environment. Clearly necessary, given external realities. As we navigate short-term challenges, we also continue to invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing commitment to building our core strength.
I've talked to you before about 3M's 4 fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise: Technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. 
On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the quarter, while at the same time, managing our SG&A investment very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities, including breaking ground on a new custom innovation center in Shendou in West China. 
As you heard from Nick, our 3M China team continues to execute well, delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's future in China. And our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely, both with local and global customers, and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China.
In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tagline, ""3M Science Applied to Life."" Through our brand work, we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives. 
So in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against stuff economical headwinds. We continue to make investments for the future. And by that, we are now open to take your questions."

And the way I look upon it is, specifically as you came off, that Q4 was around 6%. But I think overall, when you look upon the economy around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global basis. So I think, first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the same level as we have seen in the past. I think when we look upon our performance, you could see, as you see there, you'll see a little bit of a lower growth in Health Care, which is related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One is relative to West Europe and is relative to our drug delivery system, that is, I would say, a project based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of that business based on year-end or quarter. So when I look upon Health Care, that's basically where you can see. Our core business in Health Care did very well again. And as you see, we maintain very high margin, et cetera. When I look upon industrial, we had a 4% growth in United States for industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable. And I think that was related very much to as we maybe some uncertainty, generally speaking, around what will happen for exports due to the dollar strengthening and also, what you saw in oil. I think people, specifically, not so much what is designed in and expect in, but maybe on the consumables, became a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter. So I don't see that as an issue, either. And as you know, that's a big business for us, and we continue to invest in IBG. When I say big, it's -- our biggest is 33% of our portfolio. You saw again Electronic and Energy did very well. We opted a reorganization and realignment of that business now over 2 years ago. We really get good traction based on our relevance to customers and speed-to-market, et cetera. And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter. And specifically, in personal safety, that is going into respirator business. We are doing well on a global base even if it was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter, but very well in Asia. Again, in whole of APAC doing very, very well. And then, finally, consumer that you saw had a 2% growth, 4% was in U.S., which is our bigger business. I would say there, the slowness was in West Europe and Latin America was slow for them. So when I, as you all know, a quarter start and end. There's always something going in and out of a quarter. I look very carefully on 6 months comparisons going back over 2 years. And when we look upon that over 2 years with 6 months comparisons, because you don't know always if history is coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera, we have, for the last 2 years on that comparison, been in the range of 4 to 6, always in 4 to 5 during that period. So this was on the low end. But still, in the 3 to 6 that we have set for the year. And when we look upon and talk to the businesses, what we see going out for the year, I will say that maybe Q2 will be very similar to Q1, maybe slight improvement. But we not count too much of that. And then, you will see for the rest of the year more growth will come."

So consumer for us is a smaller portion in China, and so is actually Health Care as well. I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind. It's where we all grew up, what we are used to, et cetera. So it take longer time in order for you to build wellness in those businesses. So we still see growth opportunities in China for consumer. But in that specific market, I will turn Health Care and consumer around and say Health Care will get faster traction for us than consumer. So I will say, I agree with you. I hope we will be be good at this point in time. I'd hope we've been able to grow faster, but we will over time. So it is -- we have some very strong brands. It's just that it take time for us to get awareness and build out in the category. And we're also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel partners. So I think it's, over time, it will be big. We will grow faster. And we have to make sure that we get with that business good profitability for us as well, right? So we are not, as you know, giving away things. And it's not only about market share. We need to make sure that we are investing in businesses where we get the good return.

But if you think about it broader relative to our filtration business, that is a huge opportunity for us. And I will look upon that as -- I will combine it, if you like, to think about it in terms of our nonwoven technologies, combined with what we have in our Purification business and then some additional technologies that will be added later on. So if you think about global mega trends that are related to both air pollution and clean water, that is where we will play big time with a platform as we go ahead. So I will say that I'm very encouraged, actually, relative to our current performance, both in Purification and in personal safety that is around respiratory products. And we will build out those businesses as we go. So think about it as a good way of us to extend our technology capabilities in order to create more value in those spaces, which is both global mega trend, but also local mega trends. And as Scott and I talked about here earlier relative to China. China, this is a huge opportunity, as we all know, and everyone know that. But you need to be able to capitalize on it with technologies because in the end of the day, this is a very much a regulatory business, and we need to make sure we have products that meet the standards."

One is it's largely in developed markets in those currencies that we're able to cost effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging. Other currencies, such as the Brazilian real, that's less cost effective for us to hedge. In markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely more on natural hedges. Meaning, how much do we source locally? Our ability to price, to offset some of the FX movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX in more developing markets. To your question on, does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016? No, it doesn't. It's never our intent with our hedging and strategy, our financial hedging strategy, to offset all of the risk. We offset a portion of it to help minimize reduce volatility, and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and take some of that volatility off the table."

Relative to Europe, we have good penetration on the sign and spec in there as all other places. And you could assume, but who knows, that in the later part of the year, that export, generally speaking, for West Europe will improve due to the dollar versus euro and other currency. And by then, by definition, automotive will capitalize on that as well. So assuming that, that is correct, as I talk about, then there will be improved export from Europe, generally speaking. Automotive, by definition, is a big engine for growth in West Europe, as we all know. Now many of the automotive makers, they're designing and spec in certain places and produce in the other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing.

I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance.

I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved this against a more challenging first quarter economic backdrop. 
The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition, global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures.
As 3M always does, we continued to manage 2 things within our control: execute our plan and build for the future. I'll take you through the first quarter highlights.
Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%. For the seventh consecutive quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against a number of currencies, reducing sales by 6.5%.
We expanded company-wide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year, and all business groups delivered margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions over the last 3 years are paying off.
This quarter, 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio. We announced plans to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. 
Last month, we completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business. And at the same time, we completed the sales of our Static Control business in January.
Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we increased the first quarter dividend by 20% on top of a 35% increase last year.
Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our first quarter sales change. As Inge mentioned, in the quarter, we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3%, with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%. Two Health Care-related acquisitions, namely Treo Solutions and Ivera Medical, added 10 basis points to growth. This impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points.
The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of 2014. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing a trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen declined 14% and the Brazilian real, 19%.
Looking more closely at organic local currency growth. Asia Pacific led the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8% and Electronics and Energy at 7%. Organic growth was 7% in China/Hong Kong or 8% excluding Electronics, similar to recent quarters.
Japan was up against a challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year, leading up to the April 1, 2014, consumption tax increase. 
EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter, with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up mid-single digits and Middle East Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1%, respectively.
We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America/Canada, where Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil was down 2%. The United States grew 3.1% organically, with Industrial, Health Care and Consumer each growing 4%. Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy each grew 3%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating income, on the other hand, increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share.
Early in the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place, and we executed those plans as Q1 played out. Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by 90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1 percentage point. 
Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion. We continued to generate positive selling price changes across our businesses, boosted by 3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business model. In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. 
On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum as the year progresses.
Productivity added 30 basis points to margins, as spending remained under good control in the quarter and foreign currency impacts, net of hedge gains, were neutral to margins.
First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continued to make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs, along with business transformation and ERP. These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a result of the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate.
Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point.
Now let's take -- turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $90 million or the equivalent of $0.10 a share.
The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05. The increase was due to geographic mix, which was influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a onetime benefit that did not repeat. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share.
Now let's review cash flow performance on Slide #7. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million, consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
First quarter free cash flow was $789 million, and we converted 66% of net income to cash, in line with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continue to expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%.
As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter, and we continue to plan $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year. 
Now let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #8.  Industrial, with sales of $2.7 billion, delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation, Automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses all generated high single-digit growth. We also posted positive organic growth in Advanced Materials and in Industrial Adhesives & Tapes. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada set the pace with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%, Asia Pacific increased 3% and EMEA was flat.
We continue to invest for the future within Industrial. During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company.
Wrapping up on Industrial's first quarter performance. Operating income was $598 million and operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's Q1.
Now let's turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 9. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4% organically. Personal safety grew high single digits in the quarter. Worker safety remains a high priority for manufacturers globally, and we are gaining share.
In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security each posted positive organic growth, while roofing granules declined year-on-year.
Asia Pacific delivered 9% organic growth, Latin America/Canada increased 5%, the U.S. was up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continued to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on prioritization and portfolio management.
Let's now turn to Health Care on Slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%. Growth was strongest in food safety, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Our infection prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business declined year-over-year. 
Geographically, organic growth in Asia Pacific was 8%, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%. EMEA declined 1%.
In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, as health care markets rapidly evolve in developing countries.
In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's vascular access product offerings to health care facilities. Integration is going smoothly and we look forward to expanding this business globally. Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remained strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were 31.1%.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local-currency growth in the first quarter with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local-currency sales grew 12% in our electronics-related businesses as we continued to see strong consumer demand, enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local-currency sales declined 3%. The electrical markets business was flat, while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics And Energy increased 7% in Asia Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both the U.S. and Latin America/Canada.
The divestiture of the Static Control business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014. 
Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $283 million, and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities and contributing to higher productivity and margins.
Please turn to Slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion with organic growth of 2%. All 4 businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by do-it-yourself and home care, each growing mid-single digits. Looking by geography, the U.S. grew 4% and Asia Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America/Canada declined slightly year-on-year. Operating income increased to $240 million and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on productivity programs.
Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on corporate and unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension postretirement expenses being the primary reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate corporate and unallocated net expense to be approximately $400 million.
That wraps up our first quarter results. 
Please turn to Slide 13, where I'll address our full year planning estimates. On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales by 8%. 
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share versus a previous estimate of $8 to $8.30 per share. 
In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course, since then, the dollar has strengthened further. Today, we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share or an incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates. These figures are net of hedging. 
For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share. For the tax rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate.
Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments."

We executed our playbook and delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now more than ever, our teams remain keenly focused on efficient growth, focused both on organic growth and, of course, productivity.
As Nick described, we also took a number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic environment, clearly necessary given external realities. As we navigate short-term challenges, we also continue to invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing commitment to building our core strength.
I've talked to you before about 3M's 4 fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. 
On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the quarter while at the same time managing our SG&A investment very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities, including breaking ground on a new custom innovation center in Chengdu in West China. 
As you heard from Nick, our 3M China team continues to execute well, delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's future in China, and our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely, both with local and global customers, and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China.
In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tagline, ""3M Science. Applied to Life."" Through our brand work, we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives. 
So in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against tough economical headwinds. We continue to make investments for the future. 
And by that, we are now open to take your questions."

And the way I look upon it is, specifically, as you came off the Q4 was around 6%. But I think, overall, when you look upon the economy around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global base. So I think, first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the same level as we have seen in the past. I think when we will look upon our performance, you could see, as you see there, you'll see a little bit of a lower growth in Health Care, which is related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One is relative to West Europe and is relative to our drug delivery system, that is, I would say, a project-based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of that business based on year-end or quarter. So when I look upon Health Care, that's basically what you can see. And our core business in Health Care did very well, again, and as you see, we maintained very high margin, et cetera. When I look upon Industrial, we had a 4% growth in United States for Industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable. And I think that was related very much to, as there became maybe some uncertainty, generally speaking, around what will happen for exports due to the dollar strengthening and, also, what you saw in oil, I think people, specifically -- not so much what is designed in and spec-ed in, but maybe on the consumables, became [ph] a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter. So I don't see that as an issue, either. And as you know, that's a big business for us, and we continue to invest in IBG. When I say big, it's our biggest. It's 33% of our portfolio. You saw, again, Electronic and Energy did very well. We opted a reorganization and realignment of that business, now over 2 years ago. We really get good traction based on our relevance to customers and speed-to-market, et cetera. And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter. And specifically, in personal safety, that is going into respirator business. We are doing well on a global base, even if it was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter. But very well in Asia, again, and whole of APAC doing very, very well. And then, finally, Consumer that you saw had a 2% growth, 4% was in U.S., which is our bigger business. I would say there, the slowness was in West Europe, and Latin America was slow for them. So when I -- as we all know, a quarter start and end, there's always something going in and out of the quarter. I look very carefully on 6-months comparisons going back over 2 years. And when we look upon that over 2 years with 6-months comparisons, because you don't know always if history's coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera, we have, for the last 2 years on that comparison, been in the range of 4% to 6%, always in 4% to 5% during that period. So this was on the low end, but still in the 3% to 6% that we have set for the year. And when we look upon and talk to the businesses what we see going out for the year, I will say that maybe Q2 will be very similar to Q1, maybe a slight improvement. But we'll not count too much on that. And then, you will see, for the rest of the year, more growth will come."

And again, this quarter, we had a 7% growth, in fact, 8% in the core business, if you take out electronics. As I talked to earlier, the way the evolution of businesses are going is starting with Industrial, followed by Electronics and Energy, then Safety, then Consumer, finally, Health Care. So Consumer, for us, is a smaller portion in China, and so is actually Health Care as well. I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind. It's where we all grew up, what we are used to, et cetera. So it take longer time in order for you to build awareness in those businesses. So we still see growth opportunities in China for Consumer. But in that specific market, I will turn Health Care and Consumer around and say Health Care will get faster traction for us than Consumer. So I will say, I agree with you. I hope we will be bigger at this point in time. I'd hope we'd been able to grow faster, but we will over time. So it is -- we have some very strong brands. It's just that it take time for us to get awareness and build out in the category. And we are also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel [ph] partners. So I think it's -- over time, it will be big. We'll grow faster. And we just need to make sure that we get with that business good profitability for us as well, right? So we are not, as you know, giving away things. And it's not only about market share. We need to make sure that we are investing in businesses where we get a good return. And there are some very good businesses for us in China as we speak, as you know, both in Industrial -- specifically Industrial.

One is it's largely in developed markets in those currencies that we're able to cost-effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging. Other currencies such as the Brazilian real, that's less cost-effective for us to hedge. In markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely more on natural hedges, meaning, how much do we source locally? Our ability to price, to offset some of the FX movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX in more developing markets. To your question on, does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016? No, it doesn't. It's never our intent with our hedging and strategy, our financial hedging strategy, to offset all of the risk. We offset a portion of it to help minimize -- reduce volatility, and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and take some of that volatility off the table."

And you could assume, but who knows, that in the later part of the year, that export, generally speaking, for West Europe will improve due to the dollar versus euro and other currency.

Automotive, by definition, is a big engine for growth in West Europe, as we all know. Now many of the automotive makers, they're designing and spec in on certain places and produce at the other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing. To your second quarter, no, I will not say there was any change. With more than, which is a small piece, is Middle East/Africa. Middle East/Africa, as we all know and understand, due to geopolitical issues, they have challenges.

I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved this against a more challenging first quarter economic backdrop. 
The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition, global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures.
As 3M always does, we continued to manage 2 things within our control: execute our plan and build for the future. I'll take you through the first quarter highlights.
Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%. For the seventh consecutive quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against a number of currencies, reducing sales by 6.5%.
We expanded company-wide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year, and all business groups delivered margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions over the last 3 years are paying off.
This quarter, 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio. We announced plans to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. 
Last month, we completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business. And at the same time, we completed the sales of our Static Control business in January.
Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we increased the first quarter dividend by 20% on top of a 35% increase last year.
Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our first quarter sales change. As Inge mentioned, in the quarter, we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3%, with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%. Two Health Care-related acquisitions, namely Treo Solutions and Ivera Medical, added 10 basis points to growth. This impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points.
The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of 2014. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing a trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen declined 14% and the Brazilian real, 19%.
Looking more closely at organic local currency growth. Asia Pacific led the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8% and Electronics and Energy at 7%. Organic growth was 7% in China/Hong Kong or 8% excluding Electronics, similar to recent quarters.
Japan was up against a challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year, leading up to the April 1, 2014, consumption tax increase. 
EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter, with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up mid-single digits and Middle East Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1%, respectively.
We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America/Canada, where Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil was down 2%. The United States grew 3.1% organically, with Industrial, Health Care and Consumer each growing 4%. Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy each grew 3%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating income, on the other hand, increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share.
Early in the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place, and we executed those plans as Q1 played out. Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by 90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1 percentage point. 
Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion. We continued to generate positive selling price changes across our businesses, boosted by 3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business model. In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. 
On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum as the year progresses.
Productivity added 30 basis points to margins, as spending remained under good control in the quarter and foreign currency impacts, net of hedge gains, were neutral to margins.
First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continued to make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs, along with business transformation and ERP. These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a result of the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate.
Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point.
Now let's take -- turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $90 million or the equivalent of $0.10 a share.
The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05. The increase was due to geographic mix, which was influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a onetime benefit that did not repeat. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share.
Now let's review cash flow performance on Slide #7. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million, consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
First quarter free cash flow was $789 million, and we converted 66% of net income to cash, in line with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continue to expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%.
As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter, and we continue to plan $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year. 
Now let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #8.  Industrial, with sales of $2.7 billion, delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation, Automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses all generated high single-digit growth. We also posted positive organic growth in Advanced Materials and in Industrial Adhesives & Tapes. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada set the pace with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%, Asia Pacific increased 3% and EMEA was flat.
We continue to invest for the future within Industrial. During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company.
Wrapping up on Industrial's first quarter performance. Operating income was $598 million and operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's Q1.
Now let's turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 9. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4% organically. Personal safety grew high single digits in the quarter. Worker safety remains a high priority for manufacturers globally, and we are gaining share.
In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security each posted positive organic growth, while roofing granules declined year-on-year.
Asia Pacific delivered 9% organic growth, Latin America/Canada increased 5%, the U.S. was up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continued to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on prioritization and portfolio management.
Let's now turn to Health Care on Slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%. Growth was strongest in food safety, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Our infection prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business declined year-over-year. 
Geographically, organic growth in Asia Pacific was 8%, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%. EMEA declined 1%.
In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, as health care markets rapidly evolve in developing countries.
In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's vascular access product offerings to health care facilities. Integration is going smoothly and we look forward to expanding this business globally. Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remained strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were 31.1%.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local-currency growth in the first quarter with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local-currency sales grew 12% in our electronics-related businesses as we continued to see strong consumer demand, enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local-currency sales declined 3%. The electrical markets business was flat, while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 7% in Asia Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both the U.S. and Latin America/Canada.
The divestiture of the Static Control business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014. 
Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $283 million, and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities and contributing to higher productivity and margins.
Please turn to Slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion with organic growth of 2%. All 4 businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by do-it-yourself and home care, each growing mid-single digits. Looking by geography, the U.S. grew 4% and Asia Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America/Canada declined slightly year-on-year. Operating income increased to $240 million and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on productivity programs.
Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on corporate and unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension postretirement expenses being the primary reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate corporate and unallocated net expense to be approximately $400 million.
That wraps up our first quarter results. 
Please turn to Slide 13, where I'll address our full year planning estimates. On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales by 8%. 
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share versus a previous estimate of $8 to $8.30 per share. 
In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course, since then, the dollar has strengthened further. Today, we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share or an incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates. These figures are net of hedging. 
For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share. For the tax rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate.
Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments."

We executed our playbook and delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now more than ever, our teams remain keenly focused on efficient growth, focused both on organic growth and, of course, productivity.
As Nick described, we also took a number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic environment, clearly necessary given external realities. As we navigate short-term challenges, we also continue to invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing commitment to building our core strength.
I've talked to you before about 3M's 4 fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. 
On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the quarter while at the same time managing our SG&A investment very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities, including breaking ground on a new custom innovation center in Chengdu in West China. 
As you heard from Nick, our 3M China team continues to execute well, delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's future in China, and our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely, both with local and global customers, and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China.
In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tagline, ""3M Science. Applied to Life."" Through our brand work, we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives. 
So in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against tough economical headwinds. We continue to make investments for the future. 
And by that, we are now open to take your questions."

It was a little bit slower than we have seen in the past. And the way I look upon it is, specifically, as you came off the Q4 was around 6%.

And the way I look upon it is, specifically, as you came off the Q4 was around 6%. But I think, overall, when you look upon the economy around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global base. So I think, first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the same level as we have seen in the past. I think when we will look upon our performance, you could see, as you see there, you see a little bit of a lower growth in Health Care, which is related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One is relative to West Europe and is relative to our drug delivery system, that is, I would say, a project-based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of that business based on year-end or quarter. So when I look upon Health Care, that's basically what you can see. And our core business in Health Care did very well, again, and as you see, we maintained very high margin, et cetera. When I look upon Industrial, we had a 4% growth in United States for Industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable. And I think that was related very much to, as there became maybe some uncertainty, generally speaking, around what will happen for exports due to the dollar strengthening and, also, what you saw in oil, I think people, specifically -- not so much what is designed in and spec-ed in, but maybe on the consumables, became [ph] a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter. So I don't see that as an issue, either. And as you know, that's a big business for us, and we continue to invest in IBG. When I say big, it's our biggest. It's 33% of our portfolio. You saw, again, Electronic and Energy did very well. We opted a reorganization and realignment of that business, now over 2 years ago. We really get good traction based on our relevance to customers and speed-to-market, et cetera. And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter. And specifically, in personal safety, that is going into respirator business. We are doing very well on a global base, even if it was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter. But very well in Asia, again, and whole of APAC doing very, very well. And then, finally, Consumer that you saw had a 2% growth, 4% was in U.S., which is our bigger business. I would say there, the slowness was in West Europe, and Latin America was slow for them. So when I -- as we all know, a quarter start and end, there's always something going in and out of the quarter. I looked very carefully on 6-months comparisons going back over 2 years. And when we look upon that over 2 years with 6-months comparisons, because you don't know always if history's coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera, we have, for the last 2 years on that comparison, been in the range of 4% to 6%, always in 4% to 5% during that period. So this was on the low end, but still in the 3% to 6% that we have set for the year. And when we look upon and talk to the businesses what we see going out for the year, I will say that maybe Q2 would be very similar to Q1, maybe a slight improvement. But we'll not count too much on that. And then, you will see, for the rest of the year, more growth will come."

As I talked to earlier, the way the evolution of businesses are going is starting with Industrial, followed by Electronics and Energy, then Safety, then Consumer, finally, Health Care. So Consumer, for us, is a smaller portion in China, and so is actually Health Care as well. I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind. It's where we all grew up, what we are used to, et cetera. So it take longer time in order for you to build awareness in those businesses. So we still see growth opportunities in China for Consumer. But in that specific market, I will turn Health Care and Consumer around and say Health Care will get faster traction for us than Consumer. So I will say, I agree with you. I'd hope we will be bigger at this point in time. I'd hope we'd been able to grow faster, but we will over time. So it is -- we have some very strong brands. It's just that it take time for us to get awareness and build out in the category. And we are also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel [ph] partners. So I think it's -- over time, it will be big. We grow faster. And we just need to make sure that we get with that business good profitability for us as well, right?

So I will say that I'm very encouraged, actually, relative to our current performance, both in Purification and in personal safety that is around respiratory products, and we will build out those businesses as we go. So think about it as a good way of us to extend our technology capabilities in order to create more value in those spaces, which is both global mega trend but also local mega trends. And as Scott and I talked about here earlier relative to China. China, this is a huge opportunity, as we all know, and everyone know that. But you need to be able to capitalize on it with technologies because in the end of the day, this is very much a regulatory [ph] business, and we need to make sure we have products that meet the standards."

One is it's largely in developed markets in those currencies that we're able to cost-effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging. Other currencies such as the Brazilian real, that's less cost-effective for us to hedge. In markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely more on natural hedges, meaning, how much do we source locally? Our ability to price, to offset some of the FX movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX in more developing markets. To your question on, does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016? No, it doesn't. It's never our intent with our hedging and strategy, our financial hedging strategy, to offset all of the risk. We offset a portion of it to help minimize -- reduce volatility, and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and takes some of that volatility off the table."

Relative to Europe, we have good penetration on design and spec-in there, as all other places. And you could assume, but who knows, that in the later part of the year, that export, generally speaking, for West Europe will improve due to the dollar versus euro and other currency. And by then, by definition, automotive will capitalize on that as well. So assuming that, that is correct, as everyone talk about, then there will be improved export from Europe, generally speaking. Automotive, by definition, is a big engine for growth in West Europe, as we all know. Now many of the automotive makers, they're designing and spec-ing on certain places and produce at the other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing. To your second quarter, no, I will not say there was any change. With more than, which is a small piece, is Middle East/Africa. Middle East/Africa, as we all know and understand, due to geopolitical issues, there challenges. So I will say, that was not in March, I think that was for the whole first quarter, was total different environment to do business in. So I think that's the only place that we could see any change in trends, right? But that's understandable in a way, and we have to manage it through the situation."

Overall, this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment, which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins at full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long-term with strong investments in our portfolio. Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers. 
Earnings per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex Electronic basis, growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1. And I will talk more about our Electronics business shortly.
Organic growth both positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. 4 of our 5 business groups grew organically, led by Safety and Graphics at 5%, followed by consumer and Health Care businesses at 3%. Growth in the industrial slowed a bit to 1%, as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general industrial markets. 
Electronics and Energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business grew face the tough year in your comparison and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the Electronics market. However, even in softer market condition, we increased margins in Electronics and Energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter. 
As you recall, last year, we consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I'm pleased with the progress of this business. And going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technologies capabilities.
In the second quarter, we continued -- we saw a continued strength of the U.S. dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide. Our margins remained strong and broad-based as all business group posted margins greater than 21%.
This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio business model and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter, we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders.
We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month, we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of full protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we are taking to strengthen our portfolio.
Please turn to Slide #4. Portfolio management is 1 of our 3 strategic levels and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term, we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy.
Back in 2012, we began a comprehensive review of 3M's spreads polio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value, such as combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity, acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives, and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strength objectives.
In the first half of 2015, we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined 2 of our Health Care businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands will merge to form a single oral care solution business. Now through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus, increasing our relevance and generating efficiency.
In fact, since 2012, we have consummated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from 6 business groups to 5 and from 40 businesses to 26. Next, our acquisitions. Earlier, I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety.
In February, we also announced the $1 billion acquisition of Polypore Separations Media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March, we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our Health Care business group. At the same time, in January, we sold our Static Control business after thorough strategic review.
Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for our customers, and ultimately, for our shareholders today and even more so in the future. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?"

Let's begin on Slide 5, where I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8% with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%.
The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the Static Control business. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 20%, 17% and 28%, respectively.
In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014. On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. U.S. growth was broad-based, led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer at 6%, Health Care at 4% and Industrial at 3%.
Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our Health Care and Industrial businesses, while Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy both declined organically. 
Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us starting in Q3.
Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter with Health Care and Safety and Graphics each growing 9% and consumer growing 3%. Electronics and Energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific. Organic growth was down 2% in China, Hong Kong in the second quarter. Health Care delivered strong growth, which was offset by declines in Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer.
We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels, and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China, Hong Kong to be in the mid single-digit range versus mid to high single-digits previously.
Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2% or up 7% excluding Electronics. Health Care and Safety and Graphics posted strong organic growth, followed by steady growth in our consumer and industrial businesses.
Turning to EMEA. Organic growth was 0.4% in Q2 with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central/East Europe increased high single-digits, while Middle East/Africa was down mid single-digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Safety and Graphics at 4%, Health Care was flat and Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy each declined 1%.
Please turn to Slide 6 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin.
On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations.
We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remained favorable and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remained strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments.
Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP in business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with the lower discount rate.
For the full year, we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. 
Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year's Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves, which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance.
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding reduce -- declined by 3% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share. Let's now review cash flow. Please turn to Slide #8. 
Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second quarter free cash flow was $1 billion, and we converted 74% of net income to cash.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Growth share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion.
Let's now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis starting with our industrial business. Please turn to Slide #9. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial's organic growth was led by 3M Purification and Aerospace and Commercial transportation each generating double-digit growth in the quarter.
The automotive OEM business posted mid single-digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat.
On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat while EMEA declined 1%. Heavy Industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were strong a 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price raw materials.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 10. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personnel safety, one of the 3M's Heartland businesses, grew mid single-digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast-growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets.
As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further. Geographically, organic sales growth in Safety and Graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%.
Operating income was $364 million and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions.
Let's now turn to Health Care. Please turn to Slide 11. Health Care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter with organic growth of 3.4%. We continue to see broad-based organic growth across much of the Health Care portfolio, including Food Safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to Health Care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was led by Asia Pacific at 9% with strong contributions from both Japan and China, Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4% and EMEA was flat. Health Care's operating income was $440 million and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.2%. Primary drivers of marketing expansion included strong productivity and price raw material benefits.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2% and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance.
Organic local-currency sales declined 2% on the Electronics side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec in wins with electronic OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales were down 3%, consistent with the first quarter growth patterns. On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4% and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 13. 
Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of ScotchBlue Painter's Tape. Our stationery and office supplies, home care and Consumer Healthcare businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter.
Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command Solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items.
Looking at the consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America/Canada was flat and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs. 
That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update of our 2015 planning estimates."

Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M's entire team, I'm very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economic environment, which is evident in our strong productivity.
Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4% versus the prior expectation of 3% to 6%. 
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8 versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%. And we continue to expect the free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%. Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investments for the future and managing new things within our control, in other words, controlling the controllable. As I described earlier, our performance is strong and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments.
Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M's 4 fundamental streams: Technology, manufacturing, global capability and our brand.

Well, as you recall, we saw all of our stripes saw a slow economic environment coming early in the year. And after the first quarter, we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And I think now, as we move in and so the second quarter coming through here, I think it's the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And where we now, you can see -- basically, the Industrial Production Index came down even here capital weeks ago from 2 6 to 2 1. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it's prudent for us to take it now to 2.5 to 4 versus what we had earlier. I will say if I just comment on organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the Electronics. Electronics was 2 things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth 1 year ago. And then that became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right? And so I think that the 2 5 to 4, I think that's reasonable guidance for us and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that."

So I think the way I look upon this is to say we are making the same progress now as in the past relative to our spec-ing. And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you may then also can see relative to purchasing, right? So that was a little bit of delay of some new product introductions, and they didn't build inventory, right? They type of slowed it down. That's impacting us as well. I will make the comment on that business if we have to put it in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started our business with margins around 15 7, 15 8 or something and now moved that up to 21. And the question was always, is this volume driven? And my answer was always, no, the action we've taken on the portfolio in order to get the more efficient organization better aligned to customer and have better asset utilization. Meaning, if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume-related. I think we proved that to -- in this quarter, we proved that, that model is correct. So volume went down a little bit. And in fact, we had margin expansion in that business. For that and on the work we have done on our portfolio, I'm personally very pleased with what that team have done relative to that portfolio work."

But I think when I look upon it, used to say, first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully, recall, a quarter ago, that growth was slightly lower and the question were then, ""Are you concerned about U.S."" Answer was, ""No, not necessarily."" And I think with 4% growth here, that's good. In Asia or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding electronic, which is the base business at 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down. And they're kind of adjusting to a new growth level there. And we are now talking about mid to single -- mid single-digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy, as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that growth need to pick up more specifically in the domestic market and was Health Care did well for us. Data businesses went basically sideways. West Europe, we all predicted that there will be growth pickup based on the euro situation. So far, we have not seen that. And probably, it will come later in the year, but I think it will be be late in the year. Latin America is doing's fine. And as you can see again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now it's the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison where we will go into Q3. And so I think that's my view on that. So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2 5 to 4, at least as we go in for this year.

If you don't have a clear picture of where you will like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be a part on options on most things that are becoming available, right?

I will say I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever that whispered of that assets.

First of all, there is a very robust pipeline of new products in each individual business groups. So I don't see, from that perspective, a difference in between them. And -- but when I look upon it, we have some businesses here that is -- industrial is 33% of our portfolio and very strong. And we are now adding even an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that's what I call the designers spec-ing there is very strong credible business. So I think it will be strong. I think, as I said earlier, Safety and Graphics, I've talked about that for over a year now that I believe that Safety and Graphics is the next breakout business group for us as oceanic and energy game earlier, right? the margin have expanded quite a bit there. And I predicted at safety and graphics will follow and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that, that will happen. And you see our Health Care business. Health Care business is usually the fastest growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolios in the developed world. Meaning, we 20% in the developing. And that's why, a lot of growth for us is coming. And again, I would say that's what I would look upon you see the performance of our Consumer business again with a very good growth, I will say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I will say I'm -- for the future, for what we are doing here, I'm optimistic, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portal side, get more efficience in organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say year, 3M -- that productivity is important and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is on working on that big time. So no, I will not make a distinction in between there. We have good position ever."

In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities. There could have an impact where things become more attractive to us, but that's highly driven by the opportunities that we see presenting at that time."

Overall, this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins at full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio. Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers.
Earning per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex electronic basis, growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1. And I will talk more about our electronics business shortly.
Organic growth bodes positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. 4 of our 5 business groups grew organically, led by Safety and Graphics at 5%, followed by Consumer and Health Care businesses at 3%. Growth in Industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general industrial markets.
Electronics and Energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business group faced a tough year-on-year comparison, and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer market condition, we increased margins in Electronics and Energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter.
As you recall, last year, we consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I'm pleased with the progress of this business. And going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technologies' capabilities.
In the second quarter, we continued -- we saw continued strength of the U.S. dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide. Our margins remained strong and broad-based as all business groups posted margins greater than 21%.
This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and business model and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter, we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders.
We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month, we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we are taking to strengthen our portfolio.
Please turn to Slide #4. Portfolio management is 1 of our 3 strategic levers and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term, we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy.
Back in 2012, we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value such as: combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity; acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives; and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strength objectives.
In the first half of 2015, we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined 2 of our Health Care businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands, will merge to form a single Oral Care Solution business. Now through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency.
In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from 6 business groups to 5 and from 40 businesses to 26.
Next, our acquisitions. Earlier, I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also announced the $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March, we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our Health Care business group. At the same time, in January, we sold our Static Control business after thorough strategic review.
Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers, and ultimately, for our shareholders today and even more so in the future.
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?"

Let's begin on Slide 5, where I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8%, with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%.
The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the Static Control business. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 20%, 17% and 28%, respectively.
In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014. On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. U.S. growth was broad-based, led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer at 6%, Health Care at 4% and Industrial at 3%.
Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our Health Care and Industrial businesses, while Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy both declined organically.
Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us, starting in Q3.
Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter, with Health Care and Safety and Graphics each growing 9% and Consumer growing 3%. Electronics and Energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific. Organic growth was down 2% in China/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Health Care delivered strong growth, which was offset by declines in Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer.
We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels, and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China/Hong Kong to be in the mid-single-digit range versus mid- to high single digits previously.
Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2% or up 7% excluding Electronics. Health Care and Safety and Graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our Consumer and Industrial businesses.
Turning to EMEA. Organic growth was 0.4% in Q2, with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central/East Europe increased high single digits, while Middle East/Africa was down mid-single digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Safety and Graphics at 4%, Health Care was flat, and Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy each declined 1%.
Please turn to Slide 6 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin.
On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations.
We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remained favorable, and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remained strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments.
Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with the lower discount rate.
For the full year, we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point.
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year's Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves, which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance.
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding reduced -- declined by 3% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share.
Let's now review cash flow. Please turn to Slide #8.  Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second quarter free cash flow was $1 billion, and we converted 74% of net income to cash.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per-share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Growth share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion.
Let's now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with our Industrial business. Please turn to Slide #9. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial's organic growth was led by 3M Purification and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation, each generating double-digit growth in the quarter.
The automotive OEM business posted mid-single-digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat.
On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price/raw materials.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 10. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal safety, one of the 3M's heartland businesses, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast-growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets.
As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further. Geographically, organic sales growth in Safety and Graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%.
Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price/raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions.
Let's now turn to Health Care. Please turn to Slide 11. Health Care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter with organic growth of 3.4%. We continue to see broad-based organic growth across much of the Health Care portfolio, including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to Health Care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was led by Asia Pacific at 9% with strong contributions from both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4%, and EMEA was flat. Health Care's operating income was $440 million, and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion included strong productivity and price/raw material benefits.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2%, and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance.
Organic local currency sales declined 2% on the electronic side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with electronic OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales were down 3%, consistent with the first quarter growth patterns. On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4%, and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 13. 
Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of ScotchBlue Painter's Tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter.
Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items.
Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America/Canada was flat, and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million, and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs. 
That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our 2015 planning estimates."

Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M's entire team, I'm very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economic environment, which is evident in our strong productivity.
Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4% versus a prior expectation of 3% to 6%.
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8 versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%, and we continue to expect the free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%.
Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investments for the future and managing new things within our control; in other words, controlling the controllable.
As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M's 4 fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. Those strengths are leveraged across our company and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world-class margins and generate efficient growth in the future.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Well, as you recall, we saw -- all of us, right, saw a slow economic environment coming early in the year. And after the first quarter, we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And I think now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it's the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And the way we're now, you can see basically that Industrial Production Index came down even here a couple weeks ago from 2.6% to 2.1%. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it's prudent for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4% versus what we had earlier. I will say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the Electronics. Electronics was 2 things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth a year ago. And then it became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right? And so I think the 2.5% to 4%, I think that's reasonable guidance for us, and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that."

So I think the way I look upon this is to say we are making the same progress now as in the past relative to our spec-in. And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then can see relative to purchasing, right? So if there was a little bit of delay on some new product introductions and they didn't build inventory, right, the type of slowed it down, that's impacting us as well. I will make the comment on that business, if we just put this in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8%, and we now moved that up to 21%. And the question was always, ""Is this volume-driven?"" And my answer was always, ""No, the action we have taken on the portfolio in order to get a more efficient organization better aligned to customer and have better asset utilization."" Meaning, if we will have on a quarter that will happen in that business a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume-related. I think we proved that to -- in this quarter, we proved that, that model is correct. So volume went down a little bit. And in fact, we had margin expansion in that business. For that and on the work we have done on our portfolio, I'm personally very pleased with what that team had done relative to that portfolio work."

But I think when I look upon it, is to say, first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago, that growth was slightly lower, and the question were then, ""Are you concerned about U.S.?"" Answer was, ""No, not necessarily."" And I think with 4% growth here, that's good. In Asia or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding Electronic, which is the base biz at 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down, and they're kind of adjusting to a new growth level there. And we are now talking about mid to single -- mid-single digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy, as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that growth need to pick up more specifically in the domestic markets. And Health Care did well for us. The data businesses went basically sideways. West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pickup based on the euro situation. So far, we have not seen that. And probably, it will come later in the year, but I think it would be very late in the year. Latin America is doing fine. And as you see, again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now it's the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison going into Q3. And so I think that's my view on it. So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2.5% to 4%, at least as we go in for this year.

Clearly, it's strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So that's a -- I think that's an important element. There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated. And where we can drive synergy, others cannot. And the reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection. So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right. So as I said, 2 elements into it, right? It's some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot of synergy, and we will. On the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the return even faster. It's a highly regulated business, as you know. And then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to entry is very high. So you have to think about it if you're going to integrate, as you move on it, you have to make sure that you can drive more synergy. But the answer to your question, necessarily not. This was a specific case, right, so this is a very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here. And it's a high-class asset. It's a high-class asset that is very similar to 3M in terms of margins, returns and growth and so forth. So we can always -- yes?"

It's very, very tough, so you need to come into a leading position. So that was one. So yes, we were there. We were, in my view, not relevant enough for the industry. So very opportunistic. Now let's go back to your comment relative to why now. I talked about in my speech before, but I have to go back to it because I think this is important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you will like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on lost things that are becoming available, right? And if you are part of bidding on more things that are becoming available, you maybe don't really know if this is a real important, strategic imperative for you, and you should go for it. I will say, I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever, when there was bid on that asset. But maybe at that point in time, it was not clear enough relative to the portfolio where we should invest for the future. This time, it was very, very clear for me where we should go.

And -- but when I look upon it, we have some businesses here that is -- Industrial is 33% of our portfolio and very strong, and we are now adding even an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that's what I call the designer's spec-ing there is very strong credible business. So I think it will be strong. I think as I said earlier, Safety and Graphics, I've talked about that for over a year now, that I believe that Safety and Graphics is the next breakout business group for us as Electronic and Energy came earlier, right? The margin have expanded quite a bit there, and I predicted that Safety and Graphics will follow and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that, that will happen. And you see our Health Care business, Health Care business is usually the fastest-growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolio is in the developed world. Meaning, only 20% in the developing. And that's why, a lot of growth for us is coming. And again, I will say that's when I would look upon it and try to -- you see the performance of our Consumer business, again with a very good growth, I will say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I will say, I'm -- for the future, for what we are doing here, I'm optimistic, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio side, get more efficiency in organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say here at 3M that productivity is important, and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is working on that big time. So no, I will not make a distinction in between there. We have good position everywhere."

On the margin, what would change, and again, this would be volatile of exactly why we're seeing that of more -- a lower growth world. But for example, CapEx, our capital allocation strategy, I think it would be natural to assume there would be less of our capital going into our CapEx capacity building. In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities.

Overall, this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins a full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio. Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers.
Earning per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex electronic basis, growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1. And I will talk more about our electronics business shortly.
Organic growth was positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. Four of our 5 business groups grew organically, led by Safety and Graphics at 5%, followed by Consumer and Health Care businesses at 3%. Growth in Industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general industrial markets.
Electronics and Energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business group faced a tough year-on-year comparison, and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer market condition, we increased margins in Electronics and Energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter.
As you recall, last year, we consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I'm pleased with the progress of this business. And going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technologies' capabilities.
In the second quarter, we continued -- we saw continued strength of the U.S. dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide. Our margins remained strong and broad-based as all business groups posted margins greater than 21%.
This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and business model and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter, we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders.
We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month, we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we are taking to strengthen our portfolio.
Please turn to Slide #4. Portfolio management is 1 of our 3 strategic levers and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term, we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy.
Back in 2012, we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value such as: combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity; acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives; and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strength objectives.
In the first half of 2015, we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined 2 of our Health Care businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands, were merged to form a single Oral Care Solution business. Now through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency.
In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from 6 business groups to 5 and from 40 businesses to 26.
Next, our acquisitions. Earlier, I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also announced the $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March, we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our Health Care business group. At the same time, in January, we sold our Static Control business after thorough strategic review.
Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers, and ultimately, for our shareholders today and even more so in the future.
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?"

Let's begin on Slide 5, where I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8%, with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%.
The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the Static Control business. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 20%, 17% and 28%, respectively.
In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014. On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. U.S. growth was broad-based, led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer at 6%, Health Care at 4% and Industrial at 3%.
Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our Health Care and Industrial businesses, while Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy both declined organically.
Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us, starting in Q3.
Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter, with Health Care and Safety and Graphics each growing 9% and Consumer growing 3%. Electronics and Energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific. Organic growth was down 2% in China/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Health Care delivered strong growth, which was offset by declines in Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer.
We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels, and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China/Hong Kong to be in the mid-single digit range versus mid- to high single digits previously.
Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2% or up 7% excluding Electronics. Health Care and Safety and Graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our Consumer and Industrial businesses.
Turning to EMEA. Organic growth was 0.4% in Q2, with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central/East Europe increased high single digits, while Middle East/Africa was down mid-single digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Safety and Graphics at 4%, Health Care was flat, and Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy each declined 1%.
Please turn to Slide 6 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin.
On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of the currency devaluations.
We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remained favorable, and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remained strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments.
Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with the lower discount rate.
For the full year, we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point.
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year's Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves, which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance.
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding reduced -- declined by 3% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share.
Let's now review cash flow. Please turn to Slide #8. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second quarter free cash flow was $1 billion, and we converted 74% of net income to cash.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per-share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Growth share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion.
Let's now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with our Industrial business. Please turn to Slide #9. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial's organic growth was led by 3M Purification and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation, each generating double-digit growth in the quarter.
The automotive OEM business posted mid-single digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat.
On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price/raw materials.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 10. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal safety, one of the 3M's heartland businesses, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast-growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets.
As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further. Geographically, organic sales growth in Safety and Graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%.
Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price/raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions.
Let's now turn to Health Care. Please turn to Slide 11. Health Care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter with organic growth of 3.4%. We continue to see broad-based organic growth across much of the Health Care portfolio, including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to Health Care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was led by Asia Pacific at 9% with strong contributions from both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4%, and EMEA was flat. Health Care's operating income was $440 million, and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion included strong productivity and price/raw material benefits.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2%, and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance.
Organic local currency sales declined 2% on the electronic side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with electronic OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales were down 3%, consistent with the first quarter growth patterns. On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4%, and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 13. 
Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of ScotchBlue Painter's Tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter.
Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items.
Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America/Canada was flat, and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million, and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs. 
That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our 2015 planning estimates."

Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M's entire team, I'm very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economical environment, which is evident in our strong productivity.
Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4% versus a prior expectation of 3% to 6%.
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8 versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%, and we continue to expect the free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%.
Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investments for the future and managing those things within our control; in other words, controlling the controllable.
As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M's 4 fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. Those strengths are leveraged across our company and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world-class margins and generate efficient growth in the future.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And after the first quarter, we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And I think now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it's the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And the way we're now, you can see basically that Industrial Production Index came down even here a couple weeks ago from 2.6% to 2.1%. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it's prudent for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4% versus what we had earlier. I will say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the Electronics. Electronics was 2 things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth a year ago. And then it became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right? And so I think the 2.5% to 4%, I think that's reasonable guidance for us, and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that."

And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then can see relative to purchasing, right? So if there was a little bit of delay on some new product introductions and they didn't build inventory, right, the type of slowed it down, and that's impacting us as well. I will make the comment on that business, if we just put this in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8%, and we now moved that up to 21%. And the question was always, ""Is this volume-driven?"" And my answer was always, ""No, the action we have taken on the portfolio in order to get a more efficient organization better aligned to customer and have better asset utilization."" Meaning, if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume-related. I think we proved that to -- in this quarter, we proved that, that model is correct. So volume went down a little bit. And in fact, we had margin expansion in that business.

But I think when I look upon it, is to say, first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago, that growth was slightly lower, and the question was then, ""Are you concerned about U.S.?"" Answer was, ""No, not necessarily."" And I think with 4% growth here, that's good. In Asia or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding Electronic, which is the base business of 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down, and they're type of adjusting to a new growth level there. And we are now talking about mid to single -- mid-single digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy, as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that growth need to pick up more specifically in the domestic markets. And it was Health Care did well for us there. The other businesses went basically sideways. West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pickup based on the euro situation. So far, we have not seen that. And probably, it will come later in the year, but I think it will be very late in the year. Latin America is doing fine. And as you see, again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now it's the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison going into Q3. And so I think that's my view on it. So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2.5% to 4%, at least as we go in for this year.

Clearly, it's strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So that's a -- I think that's an important element. There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated. And where we can drive synergy, others cannot. And the reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection. So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right. So what I said, 2 elements into it, right? It's some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot of synergy, and we will. On the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the return even faster. It's a highly regulated business, as you know. And then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to entry is very high. So you have to think about it if you get it integrated, as you move on it, you have to make sure that you can drive more synergy. But the answer to your question, necessarily not. This was a specific case, right, so this is a very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here. And it's a high-class asset. It's a high-class asset that is very similar to 3M in terms of margins, returns and growth and so forth. So we can always -- yes?"

Now let's go back to your comment relative to why now. I talked about in my speech before, but I have to go back to it because I think this is important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you will like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on most things that are becoming available, right? And if you are part of bidding on more things that are becoming available, you maybe don't really know if this is a real important, strategic imperative for you, and you should go for it. I will say, I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever, when there was bid on that asset. But maybe at that point in time, it was not clear enough relative to the portfolio where we should invest for the future. This time, it was very, very clear for me where we should go.

And -- but when I look upon it, we have some businesses here that is -- Industrial is 33% of our portfolio and very strong, and we are now adding even an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that's what I call the designer's spec-in there is very strong credible business. So I think it will be strong. I think as I said earlier, Safety and Graphics, I've talked about that for over a year now, that I believe that Safety and Graphics is the next breakout business group for us as Electronic and Energy came earlier, right? The margin have expanded quite a bit there, and I predicted that Safety and Graphics will follow and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that, that will happen. And you see our Health Care business, Health Care business is usually the fastest-growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolio is in the developed world. Meaning, only 20% in the developing. And that's where a lot of growth for us is coming. And again, I will say that's when I would look upon it and try to [indiscernible]. You see the performance of our Consumer business, again with a very good growth, I will say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I will say, I'm -- for the future, for what we are doing here, I'm optimistic, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio side, get more efficiency in organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say here at 3M that productivity is important, and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is working on that big time. So no, I will not make a distinction in between there. We have good position everywhere."

Overall, this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins a full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio. Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers.
Earning per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex electronic basis, growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1. And I will talk more about our electronics business shortly.
Organic growth was positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. Four of our 5 business groups grew organically, led by Safety and Graphics at 5%, followed by Consumer and Health Care businesses at 3%. Growth in Industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general industrial markets.
Electronics and Energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business group faced a tough year-on-year comparison, and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer market condition, we increased margins in Electronics and Energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter.
As you recall, last year, we consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I'm pleased with the progress of this business. And going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technologies' capabilities.
In the second quarter, we continued -- we saw continued strength of the U.S. dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide. Our margins remained strong and broad-based as all business groups posted margins greater than 21%.
This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and business model and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter, we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders.
We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month, we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we are taking to strengthen our portfolio.
Please turn to Slide #4. Portfolio management is 1 of our 3 strategic levers and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term, we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy.
Back in 2012, we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value such as: combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity; acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives; and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strength objectives.
In the first half of 2015, we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined 2 of our Health Care businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands, were merged to form a single Oral Care Solution business. Now through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency.
In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from 6 business groups to 5 and from 40 businesses to 26.
Next, our acquisitions. Earlier, I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also announced the $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March, we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our Health Care business group. At the same time, in January, we sold our Static Control business after thorough strategic review.
Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers, and ultimately, for our shareholders today and even more so in the future.
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?"

Let's begin on Slide 5, where I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8%, with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%.
The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the Static Control business. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 20%, 17% and 28%, respectively.
In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014. On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. U.S. growth was broad-based, led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer at 6%, Health Care at 4% and Industrial at 3%.
Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our Health Care and Industrial businesses, while Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy both declined organically.
Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us, starting in Q3.
Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter, with Health Care and Safety and Graphics each growing 9% and Consumer growing 3%. Electronics and Energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific. Organic growth was down 2% in China/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Health Care delivered strong growth, which was offset by declines in Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer.
We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels, and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China/Hong Kong to be in the mid-single digit range versus mid- to high single digits previously.
Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2% or up 7% excluding Electronics. Health Care and Safety and Graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our Consumer and Industrial businesses.
Turning to EMEA. Organic growth was 0.4% in Q2, with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central/East Europe increased high single digits, while Middle East/Africa was down mid-single digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Safety and Graphics at 4%, Health Care was flat, and Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy each declined 1%.
Please turn to Slide 6 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin.
On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of the currency devaluations.
We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remained favorable, and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remained strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments.
Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with the lower discount rate.
For the full year, we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point.
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year's Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves, which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance.
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding reduced -- declined by 3% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share.
Let's now review cash flow. Please turn to Slide #8. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second quarter free cash flow was $1 billion, and we converted 74% of net income to cash.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per-share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Growth share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion.
Let's now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with our Industrial business. Please turn to Slide #9. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial's organic growth was led by 3M Purification and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation, each generating double-digit growth in the quarter.
The automotive OEM business posted mid-single digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat.
On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price/raw materials.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 10. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal safety, one of the 3M's heartland businesses, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast-growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets.
As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further. Geographically, organic sales growth in Safety and Graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%.
Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price/raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions.
Let's now turn to Health Care. Please turn to Slide 11. Health Care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter with organic growth of 3.4%. We continue to see broad-based organic growth across much of the Health Care portfolio, including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to Health Care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was led by Asia Pacific at 9% with strong contributions from both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4%, and EMEA was flat. Health Care's operating income was $440 million, and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion included strong productivity and price/raw material benefits.
Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2%, and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance.
Organic local currency sales declined 2% on the electronic side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with electronic OEMs.
In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales were down 3%, consistent with the first quarter growth patterns. On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4%, and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 13. 
Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of ScotchBlue Painter's Tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter.
Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items.
Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America/Canada was flat, and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million, and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs. 
That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our 2015 planning estimates."

Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M's entire team, I'm very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economical environment, which is evident in our strong productivity.
Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4% versus a prior expectation of 3% to 6%.
With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8 versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%, and we continue to expect the free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%.
Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investments for the future and managing those things within our control; in other words, controlling the controllable.
As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M's 4 fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. Those strengths are leveraged across our company and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world-class margins and generate efficient growth in the future.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And I think now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it's the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And the way we're now, you can see basically that Industrial Production Index came down even here a couple weeks ago from 2.6% to 2.1%. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it's prudent for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4% versus what we had earlier. I will say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the Electronics. Electronics was 2 things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth a year ago. And then it became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right? And so I think the 2.5% to 4%, I think that's reasonable guidance for us, and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that."

And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then can see relative to purchasing, right? So if there was a little bit of delay on some new product introductions and they didn't build inventory, right, the type of slowed it down, and that's impacting us as well. I will make the comment on that business, if we just put this in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8%, and we now moved that up to 21%. And the question was always, ""Is this volume-driven?"" And my answer was always, ""No, the action we have taken on the portfolio in order to get a more efficient organization better aligned to customer and have better asset utilization."" Meaning, if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume-related. I think we proved that to -- in this quarter, we proved that, that model is correct. So volume went down a little bit. And in fact, we had margin expansion in that business.

But I think when I look upon it, is to say, first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago, that growth was slightly lower, and the question was then, ""Are you concerned about U.S.?"" Answer was, ""No, not necessarily."" And I think with 4% growth here, that's good. In Asia or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding Electronic, which is the base business of 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down, and they're type of adjusting to a new growth level there. And we are now talking about mid to single -- mid-single digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy, as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that growth need to pick up more specifically in the domestic markets. And it was Health Care did well for us there. The other businesses went basically sideways. West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pickup based on the euro situation. So far, we have not seen that. And probably, it will come later in the year, but I think it will be very late in the year. Latin America is doing fine. And as you see, again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now it's the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison going into Q3. And so I think that's my view on it. So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2.5% to 4%, at least as we go in for this year.

Clearly, it's strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So that's a -- I think that's an important element. There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated. And where we can drive synergy, others cannot. And the reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection. So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right. So what I said, 2 elements into it, right? It's some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot of synergy, and we will. On the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the return even faster. It's a highly regulated business, as you know. And then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to entry is very high. So you have to think about it if you get it integrated, as you move on it, you have to make sure that you can drive more synergy. But the answer to your question, necessarily not. This was a specific case, right, so this is a very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here. And it's a high-class asset.

Now let's go back to your comment relative to why now. I talked about in my speech before, but I have to go back to it because I think this is important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you will like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on most things that are becoming available, right? And if you are part of bidding on more things that are becoming available, you maybe don't really know if this is a real important, strategic imperative for you, and you should go for it. I will say, I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever, when there was bid on that asset.

The margin have expanded quite a bit there, and I predicted that Safety and Graphics will follow and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that, that will happen. And you see our Health Care business, Health Care business is usually the fastest-growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolio is in the developed world. Meaning, only 20% in the developing. And that's where a lot of growth for us is coming.

And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio side, get more efficiency in organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say here at 3M that productivity is important, and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is working on that big time. So no, I will not make a distinction in between there. We have good position everywhere."

On the margin, what would change, and again, this would be volatile of exactly why we're seeing that of more -- a lower growth world. But for example, CapEx, our capital allocation strategy, I think it would be natural to assume there would be less of our capital going into our CapEx capacity building. In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities.

And as always, thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a solid operational performance in the third quarter. In an external environment that will remain soft, our team posted strong earnings, organic growth in all geographic areas and expanded margins. Equally important, we continue to make investments and take actions to build strengths on strings and position 3M for long-term success. Let me first take you through the quarterly numbers.
Earnings per share rose to $2.05, which is a 3.5% increase year-over-year. Company wide, we delivered organic local currency sales growth of 1% with positive growth across all geographic areas. 4 of our 5 business groups grew organically paced by consumer at 5% and Health Care at 4%. Acquisitions added 1 percentage to sales in the quarter, as we deployed capital to drive growth and strengthen the business. The strong U.S. dollar continued to impact our top line, reducing quarterly sales by more than 7%. Total sales in the quarter declined 5% to $7.7 billion. At the same time, we continued to generate strong productivity in the quarter by controlling those things within our control. As a result, operating margins were 24.3%, up nearly a full percentage point year-on-year. All 5 business groups delivered margins greater than 22%. In the quarter, 3M also returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now please turn to Slide #5. At 3M, we always have 1 eye on the microscope and 1 eye on the telescope. The microscope view is about driving growth, productivity and efficiency day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year to year. The telescope view is about the long term and making sure we are investing in the future. The global economy continues to evolve as do the needs for us and for our customers. 3M is evolving as well, building for a future the will be more competitive, more dynamic and more challenging. We're doing that in large part through our 3 strategic levers: Portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation.
Let me start by describing our efforts to strengthen and focus our portfolio and ongoing processes -- and ongoing process we began in 2012.
In the third quarter, we closed 2 important acquisitions to both complement organic growth and enhance 2 of 3M's core platforms, personal safety and filtration. The integration of those businesses is off to a good start. At the same time, earlier this month, we announced the divestitures of our library system business and our French License plate converting business, both within our Safety and Graphics business group. After extensive review, we concluded that these businesses was worth more to an outside owner versus remaining parts of the 3M portfolio. Selling the businesses resulted in greatest value creating for the company and for the shareholders.
Last month, we also announced the we're exploring strategic alternatives for Health Information Systems business, which is an industrial leader in Health Care coding software. Options include spinning off, selling or keeping the business. Ultimately, we will choose the best part to benefit 3M, our stakeholders and the business itself. The selection of a strategic direction is anticipated by the end of Q1 in 2016.
In addition to portfolio investments in the quarter, we continue to invest in organic growth to research and development in close partnership with our customers and the market. Technology conversion will remain a key driver for the global economy into the future, and our investments will strengthen 3M's scientific edge. And at our Investor Day in St. Paul next March, we look forward to taking you through our new state-of-the-art research laboratory.
Finally, to make 3M more competitive, more productive and more efficient, we are transforming our business processes. The backbone is a new global ERP system. As you recall, we are implementing this system on a regional basis, starting in Europe. 3M made good progress in the third quarter, including a successful deployment across the Nordic countries. Our team is focused on continuing to execute our roll-up plan in West Europe, with the United States to follow. By 2020, our business transformation efforts will result in an estimated operational savings of $500 million to $700 million annually and a reduction in working capital of $0.5 billion.
Beyond our 3 strategic levers, we are taking other steps to increase our competitiveness and strengthen 3M for the future. Today, we announced a restructuring plan that will result in a reduction of 1,500 positions. Reduction will be preliminary focused on structural overhead, largely in the United States, along with slower growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe/Middle East/Africa and Latin America.
On a pretax basis, we would take a charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter related to this plan, with savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Each and every day, as I look across our enterprise, I grow more confident in our future. We're taking action to build a stronger, more agile and more focused company that will compete and win, not just today but well into the future.
Thank you, and now Nick will give you more details in the quarter. Nick?"

Q3 organic growth was 1.2%, largely driven by higher selling prices, volumes were up slightly in the quarter. All geographic areas posted positive organic growth in the quarter.
In August, we completed the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore’s Separations Media business. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to sales growth in Q3. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.4 percentage points, with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. These currencies devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 15%, 14% and 37%, respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.2% versus the third quarter of 2014.
The United States delivered organic growth of 1.5%, led by consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Our U.S. industrial business, which experienced softer end-market conditions and a challenging year-on-year comparison, declined organically.
Asia Pacific organic sales increased 0.4% in the quarter, where 4 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth. Organic growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics, while Electronics and Energy declined year-on-year.
Within Asia Pacific, Japan increased 1% organically or 5%, excluding electronics. As you may recall, last fall, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in our Sumitomo Japan subsidiary. The 3M Japan team continues to execute well and is delivering strong results in 2015.
China/Hong Kong's organic growth was down 2% or up 3%, excluding electronics.
Moving to EMEA. We saw organic growth of 1.5%, with West Europe flat, Central/East Europe up double digits and Middle East Africa down slightly.
Finally, Latin America/Canada delivered organic growth of 2.3% versus last year's third quarter. Mexico continued its trend of strong double-digit organic growth increasing 13% while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, with operating income of $1.9 billion. Operating margins were 24.3%, an increase of 90 basis points year-on-year. As you see on the right-hand side of the slide, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 170 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity added another 20 basis points to margins as we continue to prioritize investments, benefit from past portfolio actions and drive operational efficiencies through Lean Six Sigma. Foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains increased margins by 20 basis points.
The impact from recent acquisitions reduced Q3 operating margins by 60 basis points as we began to absorb purchase accounting adjustments and worked through integration plans for Capital Safety and Polypore’s Separations Media business. Strategic investments reduced margins by 10 basis points. 
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced third quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. Through 9 months, we have increased total company operating margins by 1 percentage point to 23.7%.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.05 per share, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. The combination of organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.11 to our earnings growth this quarter. These results include a negative $0.04 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Our third quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 30.3% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-over-year, which added $0.08 to third quarter earnings per share. The acquisitions of Polypore’s Separations Media business and Capital Safety reduced earnings by $0.04 per share in the quarter due to purchase accounting adjustments and onetime expenses and integration costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 per share of additional dilution from these transactions. 
Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by approximately $95 million or the equivalent of $0.10 per share. For the full year, we expect foreign currency impacts to reduce earnings by approximately $0.40 per share. 
Let's now review cash flow performance on Slide 9. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, down slightly from last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $354 million, in line year-on-year. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus the prior expectation of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow and converted 101% of net income to cash. Free cash flow conversion for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of 95% to 100% versus 90% to 100% previously. As a reminder, our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion is typically the strongest of the year. 
We returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter, an increase of $369 million year-on-year. Cash dividends were $635 million and gross share repurchases were $1.5 billion. For the full year, growth repurchases are now forecasted to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion versus the prior expectation of $4 billion to $5 billion. 
Now let's review our business group performance, starting on Slide 10. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, up slightly organically. Our automotive OEM business grew mid-single digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business consistently grows faster than the rate of global car and light-truck production levels. 3M purification, abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes also posted positive organic growth in the quarter
Our advanced materials business declined, primarily due to weakness in the oil and gas market. The acquisition of Polypore’s Separations Media business added 70 basis points to industrial sales growth in the third quarter. 
On a geographic basis, industrial's growth was positive in Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific and EMEA while declining in the U.S. The industrial business delivered operating income of $580 million in the quarter, and operating margins were 22.5%, up 30 basis points year-over-year or up 90 basis points, excluding the Polypore’s Separations Media acquisition.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 11. Sales in Safety and Graphics increased 2.9% organically to $1.4 billion. Organic sales growth was strong across much of the portfolio, including commercial solutions and our heartland personal safety business. The business posted double-digit organic growth in Q3 while traffic, safety and security systems declined year-on-year.
Complementing Safety and Graphics organic growth was the acquisition of Capital Safety, which added 4.2% to sales in the third quarter.
On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S., while Latin America/Canada declined.
Operating income was $324 million, and operating margins declined 0.6 percentage points to 22.9%. Excluding the Capital Safety acquisition, margins rose 1.3 percentage points to 24.8%.
Please turn to Slide 12. The Health Care business generated third quarter sales of $1.3 billion, with organic growth of 3.7%. Our medical consumables businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care, along with our Oral Care business, were up mid-single digits year-on-year. Together, these businesses represent 3 quarters of our Health Care business. Health Information Systems and food safety enjoyed double-digit growth in Q3. Drug delivery declined organically, as its challenging year-on-year comparisons continued into the third quarter.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to quarterly growth. Integration of this business is going well, and it is exceeding sales and profit objectives.
Our Health Care business grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific and the U.S. The business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 10% organic growth in the quarter. Countries with notable strength included Taiwan, China/Hong Kong, India and Mexico, all up double digits.
Health Care's operating income was $432 million, with margins of 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year.
Next, let's cover the third quarter performance of Electronics and Energy. Please turn to Slide 13. Sales for this business were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 2.8% organically, while operating income increased slightly to $342 million. Portfolio management actions, raw material benefits and the team's relentless focus on operational excellence drove a 240 basis point improvement in operating margins to 24.9%.
Organic sales declined 3% on the electronics side of the business, with electronics material solutions up slightly and Display Materials and Systems declining.
In our energy-related businesses, organic sales were down 2%, similar to past quarters, with growth in telcom, more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy.
On a geographic basis, organic growth increased in EMEA while the U.S., Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific all declined. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Third quarter sales in consumer were $1.2 billion, with organic growth of 5%. Organic growth was led by our stationery and office supplies business, with strong back-to-school sales in Scotch home and office tapes, Post-it and Command products. In the home improvement business, our Filtrete brand filters, which significantly improve air quality in the home, also helped to propel growth in the quarter. Our home care business also delivered positive organic growth while consumer Health Care declined slightly.
Looking at the business, consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA while Latin America/Canada declined. Operating income increased to $293 million and margins were 25.2%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year.
That wraps up our review of the third quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 15, where Inge will provide an update on our 2015 planning estimates. Inge?"

I think first of all, when you look upon the decline in terms of IPI growth, we have all seen that going down quarter-by-quarter during the year. And that is related both to United States and to China and Germany. You can say basically on a global base. I think that has one impact. And then of course, enterprises around the world look upon the balance sheet and the cash flow and type of work down the inventory as well. So I would say when we look upon our performance in terms of growth, yes, it slowed during the year, but we don't believe and we know that we are not losing out in terms of penetration or market share, but I think it's a combination of both of them. So we clearly see a -- we ending out a year, I would say, at the lower global growth rate in the economy versus what all of us anticipated as we went into the year. And when I look upon that, I feel personally very good of how, we as a team, and I'm talking now about all the 90,000 at 3M and be able to manage that through and improve most other metrics when it became more of a challenge for us to grow. But we are growing, right? We are growing, and we have margins expansion and very good cash flow. So that answer your question. I think it's a combination of both, and I think people would like to look out a couple of years now what would this mean. And I think everything you see that we have been doing this year in terms of our portfolio work and our investment in R&D and the business transformation, in addition to the announcement today of a restructuring is for us to be prepared as we move ahead in order for us to give good retain despite maybe something that is being difficult for us to control, which is the growth in IPI and GDP. So I hope that helps."

It's tough for rates prices when you have -- when you're trying to raise prices in an economy in a recession. And then at the same time, Simon of these countries like Brazil are kind of hard to restructure. It's not easy to fire people there either. I mean, how do you plan for it? Then how do you change? I mean, do you just keep moving forward then like [indiscernible] have? Or do you start to think in terms of taking real fixed assets out and disinvesting in some of these areas?"

Because the landscape changed and then you have to -- that's always said you dealt in the forest and you dealt with your map. And the map and the floor, it doesn't connect any longer. The forest is also always right, so you cannot continue with your map if you think about that as the business plan. So we are doing that. when I look back over the years here, it's not something that we react to just today based on a quarter that is softer in one way or the other. You'll go back to China for instance. We have not added people there for 12 to 18 months. We didn't reduce by definition, but we adjusted and slowed down the way we added people. Brazil today, you're correct, Brazil today was still, in my view and I think in most of our views, be a challenge maybe for the next 2 years. And you can see also in the restructuring announcement today, we are talking about Latin America as a primary focus and inside of that is of course, Brazil. So what you have to do is to surgically go in and address it. And I think that's serving us well with the model we have that is very much around localization, meaning we have a managing director in each country that is leading to operation and there's an empowerment around that. But to get a lot of help from us, I can tell you that Scott in order to make an sure that we take action. But yes, careful in terms of building out assets in terms of manufacturing and so forth that you may be did differently 5, 6 years ago. And yes, see how you can serve those markets differently. Now you heard, as Nick said, if you take our Health Care business that is growing very well and is very profitable, they had 10% organic local currency growth in developing economies in the quarter. Consumers doing well, et cetera. So when I look upon it, yes, there is a shift in the second quarter between developed and developing, and we adjust accordingly that we -- there's still a big penetration opportunities in those countries. But you're more cautious. You are looking upon it slightly different and make sure you position yourself for the long term."

And what has happened is, first of all, we realigned the businesses. As you may be recall, we did that in 2000 -- late 2012. And one of the reasons for that was we reduced the number of business groups, right? So we tried to build out relevance for our customers. We reduced a number of divisions, meaning tried to get out efficient -- not the efficiency, more productivity and get more alignment with the market and the customer. So we were able to respond faster with technology platforms. If you take this specific business, Electronics and Energy, we went from 8 or 9 divisions to 4 divisions, and we've relentlessly looked upon the structure of it and we reallocate assets in a better way that we had for that specific business that they have to utilize maybe in between 3 different business groups. Now we add it together so they could manage. It would help them to drive efficiency in the manufacturing, be able to respond much faster to customer demands and also they address a lot of the, I would say, issues in the portfolio, right? So remember, we had this analysis where we had a hotline division, strategic or Push Forward and then under strategic review. They addressed that all of that. And as I've said earlier, and I think this is now showing again, I said the last 2 quarters that the margins for that business is now at the point that is not dependent on big growth on top line only to drive margins. So we have now proven that for the third quarter that the model is now streamlined, efficient with very good combination of manufacturing, commercialization and R&D capabilities in a very streamlined the organization. And then I would say, you said -- you referred to rest of 3M, it's the same everywhere but this business group could get a big left because where they started. One business that we -- you see have a very good result this quarter is consumer. Consumer 2012 also started with 8 divisions and now 4 divisions. We worked to streamline the organizations. We took out unnecessary layer to an organization. We have addressed span of control and levels in the organization. And that is happening everywhere in 3M. You see bigger benefit from some short term because they had the lower starting point. But EBG had the lowest, right? And if you're running 15.7% operating margin and a part of 3M, that is not us. And I would complement that business group for taking that on and work it through. And today, we see the result. It's nice to see."

First of all, that incremental to ERP, the track record, the trending for the ERP pacing? I assume there's an enablement? Are they completely separate? Is one enabled by the order? Was there any financial overlap between the 2?"

And now the efficiency is now at a point where we can take the next swing of it. But I would say that when you look at an organization like ours, we have to make sure that we really have the commercialization capabilities in place, that we have continued focus on research and development and also I would say around Lean Six Sigma, making sure in times like these that we maybe even add more to Lean Six Sigma. What you have to ask is all this structure, management layers and so forth, right, which is necessary sometimes but then you're coming to other times where it has to pay for the future.

We don't call it life sciences, but it's a combination of Health Care and biotech where there is big opportunities for us. And we do business in the biotech area, not necessarily with our Health Care business group but very much with the purification business. And there's big opportunities for us that we can build out. But at this point in time, the total focus is short term to integrate the business, make sure we get full leverage based on what we are paid and can give back to the shareholders based on what we paid for that business. But you're right, I think you have more opportunities in businesses going versus Health Care, life sciences, biotech than you have for instance in consumer or Safety and Graphics.

And I think the important thing that was for sure not in the first [indiscernible] under Strategic Review. It's a business that is doing very well. I think it's our responsibility to look upon all businesses to say can we get better benefit in the different business model? Is there more value that can be created in a different way for some of our businesses. This business could be one of them where we would like to evaluate. And as you know, it could be a spend, it could be a sell or we keep it. We are making that evaluation now, and we will know because I wouldn't like to move forward or -- and ahead of our on process. I said in the end of Q1, we should know how the outcome of that will be. If you go back and look upon -- in my view at least today, we have a very good process in order to measure our businesses and try to understand where we can leverage even more. And in some cases, we have to ask the question, can we lever more and can there be more return to shareholders in a different business model? I think that's my responsibility to do. And I think it's our team's responsibility to do and then we do it. So it's not always a business that is underperforming that you need to evaluate. Sometimes in a case like this, you have to look upon it. And it had been on my mind for sometime, I would say, but I'm very careful to not overload the organization, the initiatives relative to the portfolio. My first objective was to make sure that we got all businesses to respectable position, and I think we are there now, as you have seen with result in EEBG as well and there's a time for everything. Now we are here. We have announced it. We're transparent about it and then we have to see in the end of Q1 what the next step will be. Any case, it's a fantastic business if it's with us, if it's a spin or it's sold. It's fantastic so there's nothing wrong with this business.

And as always, thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a solid operational performance in the third quarter. In an external environment that will remain soft, our team posted strong earnings, organic growth in all geographic areas and expanded margins. Equally important, we continue to make investments and take actions to build strength on strings and position 3M for long-term success. Let me first take you through the quarterly numbers.
Earnings per share rose to $2.05, which is a 3.5% increase year-over-year. Company-wide, we delivered organic local currency sales growth of 1%, with positive growth across all geographic areas. 4 of our 5 business groups grew organically paced by consumer at 5% and Health Care at 4%. Acquisitions added 1 percentage to sales in the quarter, as we deployed capital to drive growth and strengthen the business. The strong U.S. dollar continued to impact our top line, reducing quarterly sales by more than 7%. Total sales in the quarter declined 5% to $7.7 billion. At the same time, we continued to generate strong productivity in the quarter by controlling those things within our control. As a result, operating margins were 24.3%, up nearly a full percentage point year-on-year. All 5 business groups delivered margins greater than 22%. In the quarter, 3M also returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now please turn to Slide #5. At 3M, we always have 1 eye on the microscope and 1 eye on the telescope. The microscope view is about driving growth, productivity and efficiency day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. The telescope view is about the long term and making sure we are investing in the future. The global economy continues to evolve as do the needs for us and for our customers. 3M is evolving as well, building for a future the will be more competitive, more dynamic and more challenging. We're doing that in large part through our 3 strategic levers: portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation.
Let me start by describing our efforts to strengthen and focus our portfolio and ongoing processes -- an ongoing process we began in 2012.
In the third quarter, we closed 2 important acquisitions to both complement organic growth and enhance 2 of 3M's core platforms, personal safety and filtration. The integration of those businesses is off to a good start. At the same time, earlier this month, we announced the divestitures of our library system business and our French License plate converting business, both within our Safety and Graphics business group. After extensive review, we concluded that these businesses was worth more to an outside owner versus remaining parts of the 3M portfolio. Selling the businesses resulted in greatest value creating for the company and for the shareholders.
Last month, we also announced the we're exploring strategic alternatives for health information systems business, which is an industrial leader in Health Care coding software. Options include spinning off, selling or keeping the business. Ultimately, we will choose the best part to benefit 3M, our stakeholders and the business itself. The selection of a strategic direction is anticipated by the end of Q1 in 2016.
In addition to portfolio investments in the quarter, we continue to invest in organic growth to research and development in close partnership with our customers and the market. Technology conversion will remain a key driver for the global economy into the future, and our investments will strengthen 3M's scientific edge. And at our Investor Day in St. Paul next March, we look forward to taking you through our new state-of-the-art research laboratory.
Finally, to make 3M more competitive, more productive and more efficient, we are transforming our business processes. The backbone is a new global ERP system. As you recall, we are implementing this system on a regional basis, starting in Europe. 3M made good progress in the third quarter, including a successful deployment across the Nordic countries. Our team is focused on continuing to execute our roll-up plan in West Europe, with the United States to follow. By 2020, our business transformation efforts will result in an estimated operational savings of $500 million to $700 million annually and a reduction in working capital of $0.5 billion.
Beyond our 3 strategic levers, we are taking other steps to increase our competitiveness and strengthen 3M for the future. Today, we announced a restructuring plan that will result in a reduction of 1,500 positions. Reduction will be preliminary focused on structural overhead, largely in the United States, along with slower growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe/Middle East/Africa and Latin America.
On a pretax basis, we would take a charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter related to this plan, with savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Each and every day, as I look across our enterprise, I grow more confident in our future. We're taking action to build a stronger, more agile and more focused company that will compete and win, not just today, but well into the future.
Thank you, and now Nick will go through more details on the quarter. Nick?"

Q3 organic growth was 1.2%, largely driven by higher selling prices. Volumes were up slightly in the quarter. All geographic areas posted positive organic growth in the quarter.
In August, we completed the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to sales growth in Q3. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.4 percentage points, with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. These currencies devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 15%, 14% and 37%, respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.2% versus the third quarter of 2014.
United States delivered organic growth of 1.5%, led by Consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Our U.S. industrial business, which experienced softer end-market conditions and a challenging year-on-year comparison, declined organically.
Asia Pacific organic sales increased 0.4% in the quarter, where 4 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth. Organic growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics, while Electronics and Energy declined year-on-year.
Within Asia Pacific, Japan increased 1% organically or 5%, excluding Electronics. As you may recall, last fall, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in our Sumitomo Japan subsidiary. The 3M Japan team continues to execute well and is delivering strong results in 2015.
China/Hong Kong's organic growth was down 2% or up 3%, excluding Electronics.
Moving to EMEA. We saw organic growth of 1.5%, with West Europe flat, Central/East Europe up double digits and Middle East Africa down slightly.
Finally, Latin America/Canada delivered organic growth of 2.3% versus last year's third quarter. Mexico continued its trend of strong double-digit organic growth increasing 13% while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, with operating income of $1.9 billion. Operating margins were 24.3%, an increase of 90 basis points year-on-year. As you see on the right-hand side of the slide, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 170 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity added another 20 basis points to margins as we continue to prioritize investments, benefit from past portfolio actions and drive operational efficiencies through Lean Six Sigma. Foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains increased margins by 20 basis points.
The impact from recent acquisitions reduced Q3 operating margins by 60 basis points as we began to absorb purchase accounting adjustments and worked through integration plans for Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. Strategic investments reduced margins by 10 basis points. 
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced third quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. Through 9 months, we have increased total company operating margins by 1 percentage point to 23.7%.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.05 per share, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. The combination of organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.11 to our earnings growth this quarter. These results include a negative $0.04 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Our third quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 30.3% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-over-year, which added $0.08 to third quarter earnings per share. The acquisitions of Polypore's Separations Media business and Capital Safety reduced earnings by $0.04 per share in the quarter due to purchase accounting adjustments and onetime expenses and integration costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 per share of additional dilution from these transactions. 
Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by approximately $95 million or the equivalent of $0.10 per share. For the full year, we expect foreign currency impacts to reduce earnings by approximately $0.40 per share. 
Let's now review cash flow performance on Slide 9. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, down slightly from last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $354 million, in line year-on-year. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow and converted 101% of net income to cash. Free cash flow conversion for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of 95% to 100% versus 90% to 100% previously. As a reminder, our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion is typically the strongest of the year. 
We returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter, an increase of $369 million year-on-year. Cash dividends were $635 million and gross share repurchases were $1.5 billion. For the full year, growth repurchases are now forecasted to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $4 billion to $5 billion. 
Now let's review our business group performance, starting on Slide 10. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, up slightly organically. Our automotive OEM business grew mid-single digits as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business consistently grows faster than the rate of global car and light truck production levels. 3M Purification, abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes also posted positive organic growth in the quarter
Our advanced materials business declined, primarily due to weakness in the oil and gas market. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business added 70 basis points to industrial sales growth in the third quarter. 
On a geographic basis, industrial's growth was positive in Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific and EMEA while declining in the U.S. The industrial business delivered operating income of $580 million in the quarter, and operating margins were 22.5%, up 30 basis points year-over-year or up 90 basis points, excluding the Polypore's Separations Media acquisition.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 11. Sales in Safety and Graphics increased 2.9% organically to $1.4 billion. Organic sales growth was strong across much of the portfolio, including commercial solutions and our Heartland personal safety business. The business posted double-digit organic growth in Q3 while traffic, safety and security systems declined year-on-year.
Complementing Safety and Graphics organic growth was the acquisition of Capital Safety, which added 4.2% to sales in the third quarter.
On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S. while Latin America/Canada declined.
Operating income was $324 million, and operating margins declined 0.6 percentage points to 22.9%. Excluding the Capital Safety acquisition, margins rose 1.3 percentage points to 24.8%.
Please turn to Slide 12. The Health Care business generated third quarter sales of $1.3 billion, with organic growth of 3.7%. Our medical consumables businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care, along with our oral care business, were up mid-single digits year-on-year. Together, these businesses represent 3 quarters of our Health Care business. Health information systems and food safety enjoyed double-digit growth in Q3. Drug delivery declined organically, as its challenging year-on-year comparison continued into the third quarter.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to quarterly growth. Integration of this business is going well, and it is exceeding sales and profit objectives.
Our Health Care business grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific and the U.S. The business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 10% organic growth in the quarter. Countries with notable strength included Taiwan, China/Hong Kong, India and Mexico, all up double digits.
Health Care's operating income was $432 million, with margins of 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year.
Next, let's cover the third quarter performance of Electronics and Energy. Please turn to Slide 13. Sales for this business were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 2.8% organically while operating income increased slightly to $342 million. Portfolio management actions, raw material benefits and the team's relentless focus on operational excellence drove a 240 basis point improvement in operating margins to 24.9%.
Organic sales declined 3% on the electronics side of the business, with electronics material solutions up slightly and Display Materials and Systems declining.
In our energy-related businesses, organic sales were down 2%, similar to past quarters, with growth in telecom more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy.
On a geographic basis, organic growth increased in EMEA while the U.S., Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific all declined. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion, with organic growth of 5%. Organic growth was led by our stationery and office supplies business, with strong back-to-school sales in Scotch home and office tapes, Post-it and Command products. In the home improvement business, our Filtrete brand filters, which significantly improve air quality in the home, also helped to propel growth in the quarter. Our home care business also delivered positive organic growth while consumer health care declined slightly.
Looking at the business -- Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA while Latin America/Canada declined. Operating income increased to $293 million and margins were 25.2%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year.
That wraps up our review of the third quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 15, where Inge will provide an update on our 2015 planning estimates. Inge?"

I think first of all, when you look upon the decline in terms of IPI growth, we have all seen that going down quarter-by-quarter during the year. And that is related both to United States and to China and Germany. You can say basically on a global base. I think that has one impact. And then of course, enterprises around the world look upon the balance sheet and the cash flow and type of work down the inventory as well. So I would say when we look upon our performance in terms of growth, yes, it slowed during the year, but we don't believe and we know that we are not losing out in terms of penetration or market share, but I think it's a combination of both of them. So we clearly see a -- we're ending out the year, I would say, at the lower global growth rate in economy versus what all of us anticipated as we went into the year. And when I look upon that, I feel personally very good of how, we as a team, and I'm talking now about all the 90,000 at 3M and be able to manage that through and improve most other metrics when it became more of a challenge for us to grow. But we are growing, right? We are growing, and we have margins expansion and very good cash flow. So -- but answer your question, I think it's a combination of both, and I think people would like to look out a couple of years now what would this mean. And I think everything you see that we have been doing this year in terms of our portfolio work and our investment in R&D and the business transformation, in addition to the announcement today of a restructuring is for us to be prepared as we move ahead in order for us to give good return despite maybe something that is being difficult for us to control, which is the growth in IPI and GDP. So I hope that helps."

It's tough to raise prices when you have -- when you're trying to raise prices in economy in a recession. And then at the same time, some of these countries like Brazil are kind of hard to restructure. It's not easy to fire people there either. I mean, how do you plan for it? And how do you change? I mean, do you just keep moving forward like you always have? Or do you start to think in terms of taking real fixed assets out and disinvesting in some of these areas?"

No, it has not continue as we have done in the past of course, right, because you -- the landscape changed and then you have to -- as I always said, you go in the forest and you go with your map, and the map and the forest doesn't connect any longer. The forest is also always right, so you cannot continue with your map if you think about that as the business plan. So we are doing that. And when I look back over the years here, it's not something that we react to just today based on a quarter that is softer in one way or the other. You'll go back to China for instance. We have not added people there for 12 to 18 months. We didn't reduce by definition, but we adjusted and slowed down the way we added people. Brazil today, you're correct, Brazil today will still, in my view and I think in most of our views, be a challenge maybe for the next 2 years. And you can see also in the restructuring announcement today, we are talking about Latin America as a primary focus and inside of that is, of course, Brazil. So what you have to do is to surgically go in and address it. And I think that's serving us well with the model we have that is very much around localization, meaning, we have a managing director in each country that is leading to operation, and there is an empowerment around that. But they get a lot of help from us, I can tell you that, Scott, in order to make sure that we take action. But yes, we're careful in terms of building out assets in terms of manufacturing and so forth that you may be did differently 5, 6 years ago, and yes, see how you can serve those markets differently. Now you heard, as Nick said, if you take our Health Care business that is growing very well and is very profitable, they had 10% organic local currency growth in developing economies in the quarter. Consumers doing well, et cetera. So when I look upon it, yes, there is a shift in between developed and developing, and we adjust accordingly, but we -- there's still a big penetration opportunities in those countries. But you're more cautious. You are looking upon it slightly different and make sure you position yourself for the long term."

And what has happened is, first of all, we realigned the businesses. As you maybe recall, we did that in 2000 -- late 2012. And one of the reasons for that was we reduced the number of business groups, right? So we tried to build out relevance for our customers. We reduced the number of divisions, meaning, tried to get out efficient -- more efficiency, more productivity and get more alignment with the market and the customer. So we were able to respond faster with technology platforms. If you take this specific business, Electronics and Energy, we went from 8 or 9 divisions to 4 divisions. We relentlessly looked upon the structure of it, and we reallocate assets in a better way that we had for that specific business that they have to utilize maybe in between 3 different business groups. Now we add it together so they could manage. It would help them to drive efficiency in the manufacturing, be able to respond much faster to customer demands and also they address a lot of, I would say, issues in the portfolio, right? So remember, we had this analysis where we had a hotline division, strategic or Push Forward and then under strategic review. They addressed all of that. And as I've said earlier, and I think this is now showing again, I said in last 2 quarters that the margins for that business is now at the point that is not dependent on big growth on top line only to drive margins. So we have now proven that for the third quarter that the model is now streamlined, efficient with very good combination of manufacturing, commercialization and R&D capabilities in a very streamlined organization. And I would say -- you said -- you referred to rest of 3M, it's the same everywhere, but this business group could get a big lift because where they started. One business that we -- you see have a very good result this quarter is Consumer. Consumer 2012 also started with 8 divisions and now 4 divisions. We worked to streamline the organization. We took out unnecessary layer to an organization. We have addressed span of control and levels in the organization. And that is happening everywhere in 3M. You see bigger benefit from some short term because they had a lower starting point. But EBG had the lowest, right? And if you're running 15.7% operating margin and a part of 3M, that is not us. And I would complement that business group for taking that on and work it through. And today, we see the result. It's nice to see."

Is there more value that can be created in a different way for some of our businesses? This business could be one of them where we would like to evaluate. And as you know, it could be a spend. It could be a sell or we keep it. We are making that evaluation now, and we will know because I wouldn't like to move forward or -- and ahead of our own process. I said in the end of Q1, we should know how the outcome of that will be. If you go back and look upon -- in my view, at least, today, we have a very good process in order to measure our businesses and try to understand where we can leverage even more.

So we continue to invest in this business, and I -- as far as margins going further, I'm not ready to make a statement like that yet, but we continue to see this business growing and with margins that are at or slightly higher than the total company margins."

And as always, thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a solid operational performance in the third quarter. In an external environment that will remain soft, our team posted strong earnings, organic growth in all geographic areas and expanded margins. Equally important, we continue to make investments and take actions to build strength on strengths and position 3M for long-term success. Let me first take you through the quarterly numbers.
Earnings per share rose to $2.05, which is a 3.5% increase year-over-year. Company-wide, we delivered organic local currency sales growth of 1%, with positive growth across all geographic areas. 4 of our 5 business groups grew organically paced by consumer at 5% and Health Care at 4%. Acquisitions added 1 percentage to sales in the quarter, as we deployed capital to drive growth and strengthen the business. The strong U.S. dollar continued to impact our top line, reducing quarterly sales by more than 7%. Total sales in the quarter declined 5% to $7.7 billion. At the same time, we continued to generate strong productivity in the quarter by controlling those things within our control. As a result, operating margins were 24.3%, up nearly a full percentage point year-on-year. All 5 business groups delivered margins greater than 22%. In the quarter, 3M also returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now please turn to Slide #5. At 3M, we always have 1 eye on the microscope and 1 eye on the telescope. The microscope view is about driving growth, productivity and efficiency day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. The telescope view is about the long term and making sure we are investing in the future. The global economy continues to evolve as do the needs for us and for our customers. 3M is evolving as well, building for a future that will be more competitive, more dynamic and more challenging. We're doing that in large part through our 3 strategic levers: portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation.
Let me start by describing our efforts to strengthen and focus our portfolio and ongoing processes -- an ongoing process we began in 2012.
In the third quarter, we closed 2 important acquisitions to both complement organic growth and enhance 2 of 3M's core platforms: personal safety and filtration. The integration of those businesses is off to a good start. At the same time, earlier this month, we announced the divestitures of our library system business and our French license plate converting business, both within our Safety and Graphics business group. After extensive review, we concluded that these businesses was worth more to an outside owner versus remaining part of the 3M portfolio. Selling the businesses resulted in greatest value creating for the company and for the shareholders.
Last month, we also announced that we're exploring strategic alternatives for health information systems business, which is an industrial leader in Health Care coding software. Options include spinning off, selling or keeping the business. Ultimately, we will choose the best path to benefit 3M, our stakeholders and the business itself. The selection of a strategic direction is anticipated by the end of Q1 in 2016.
In addition to portfolio investments in the quarter, we continue to invest in organic growth to research and development in close partnership with our customers and the market. Technology conversion will remain a key driver for the global economy into the future, and our investments will strengthen 3M's scientific edge. And at our Investor Day in St. Paul next March, we look forward to taking you through our new state-of-the-art research laboratory.
Finally, to make 3M more competitive, more productive and more efficient, we are transforming our business processes. The backbone is a new global ERP system. As you recall, we are implementing this system on a regional basis, starting in Europe. 3M made good progress in the third quarter, including a successful deployment across the Nordic countries. Our team is focused on continuing to execute our roll-up plan in West Europe, with the United States to follow. By 2020, our business transformation efforts will result in an estimated operational savings of $500 million to $700 million annually and a reduction in working capital of $0.5 billion.
Beyond our 3 strategic levers, we are taking other steps to increase our competitiveness and strengthen 3M for the future. Today, we announced a restructuring plan that will result in a reduction of 1,500 positions. Reduction will be preliminary focused on structural overhead, largely in the United States, along with slower growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe/Middle East/Africa and Latin America.
On a pretax basis, we would take a charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter related to this plan, with savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Each and every day, as I look across our enterprise, I grow more confident in our future. We're taking action to build a stronger, more agile and more focused company that will compete and win, not just today, but well into the future.
Thank you, and now Nick will go through more details on the quarter. Nick?"

Q3 organic growth was 1.2%, largely driven by higher selling prices. Volumes were up slightly in the quarter. All geographic areas posted positive organic growth in the quarter.
In August, we completed the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to sales growth in Q3. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.4 percentage points, with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. These currencies devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 15%, 14% and 37%, respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.2% versus the third quarter of 2014.
United States delivered organic growth of 1.5%, led by Consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Our U.S. Industrial business, which experienced softer end-market conditions and a challenging year-on-year comparison, declined organically.
Asia Pacific organic sales increased 0.4% in the quarter, where 4 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth. Organic growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics, while Electronics and Energy declined year-on-year.
Within Asia Pacific, Japan increased 1% organically or 5%, excluding Electronics. As you may recall, last fall, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in our Sumitomo Japan subsidiary. The 3M Japan team continues to execute well and is delivering strong results in 2015.
China/Hong Kong's organic growth was down 2% or up 3%, excluding Electronics.
Moving to EMEA. We saw organic growth of 1.5%, with West Europe flat, Central/East Europe up double digits and Middle East/Africa down slightly.
Finally, Latin America/Canada delivered organic growth of 2.3% versus last year's third quarter. Mexico continued its trend of strong double-digit organic growth, increasing 13% while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, with operating income of $1.9 billion. Operating margins were 24.3%, an increase of 90 basis points year-on-year. As you see on the right-hand side of the slide, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 170 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity added another 20 basis points to margins as we continue to prioritize investments, benefit from past portfolio actions and drive operational efficiencies through Lean Six Sigma. Foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains increased margins by 20 basis points.
The impact from recent acquisitions reduced Q3 operating margins by 60 basis points as we began to absorb purchase accounting adjustments and worked through integration plans for Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. Strategic investments reduced margins by 10 basis points. 
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced third quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. Through 9 months, we have increased total company operating margins by 1 percentage point to 23.7%.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.05 per share, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. The combination of organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.11 to our earnings growth this quarter. This results -- include a negative $0.04 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Our third quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 30.3% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-over-year, which added $0.08 to third quarter earnings per share. The acquisitions of Polypore's Separations Media business and Capital Safety reduced earnings by $0.04 per share in the quarter due to purchase accounting adjustments and onetime expenses and integration costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 per share of additional dilution from these transactions. 
Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by approximately $95 million or the equivalent of $0.10 per share. For the full year, we expect foreign currency impacts to reduce earnings by approximately $0.40 per share. 
Let's now review cash flow performance on Slide 9. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, down slightly from last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $354 million, in line year-on-year. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow and converted 101% of net income to cash. Free cash flow conversion for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of 95% to 100% versus 90% to 100% previously. As a reminder, our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion is typically the strongest of the year. 
We returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter, an increase of $369 million year-on-year. Cash dividends were $635 million and gross share repurchases were $1.5 billion. For the full year, gross repurchases are now forecasted to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $4 billion to $5 billion. 
Now let's review our business group performance, starting on Slide 10. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, up slightly organically. Our automotive OEM business grew mid-single digits as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business consistently grows faster than the rate of global car and light truck production levels. 3M purification, abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes also posted positive organic growth in the quarter
Our advanced materials business declined, primarily due to weakness in the oil and gas market. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business added 70 basis points to Industrial sales growth in the third quarter. 
On a geographic basis, Industrial's growth was positive in Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific and EMEA while declining in the U.S. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $580 million in the quarter, and operating margins were 22.5%, up 30 basis points year-over-year or up 90 basis points, excluding the Polypore's Separations Media acquisition.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 11. Sales in Safety and Graphics increased 2.9% organically to $1.4 billion. Organic sales growth was strong across much of the portfolio, including commercial solutions and our Heartland personal safety business. The roofing granules business posted double-digit organic growth in Q3 while traffic, safety and security systems declined year-on-year.
Complementing Safety and Graphics organic growth was the acquisition of Capital Safety, which added 4.2% to sales in the third quarter.
On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S. while Latin America/Canada declined.
Operating income was $324 million, and operating margins declined 0.6 percentage points to 22.9%. Excluding the Capital Safety acquisition, margins rose 1.3 percentage points to 24.8%.
Please turn to Slide 12. The Health Care business generated third quarter sales of $1.3 billion, with organic growth of 3.7%. Our medical consumables businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care, along with our oral care business, were up mid-single digits year-on-year. Together, these businesses represent 3 quarters of our Health Care business. Health information systems and food safety enjoyed double-digit growth in Q3. Drug delivery declined organically, as its challenging year-on-year comparisons continued into the third quarter.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to quarterly growth. Integration of this business is going well, and it is exceeding sales and profit objectives.
Our Health Care business grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific and the U.S. The business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 10% organic growth in the quarter. Countries with notable strength included Taiwan, China/Hong Kong, India and Mexico, all up double digits.
Health Care's operating income was $432 million, with margins of 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year.
Next, let's cover the third quarter performance of Electronics and Energy. Please turn to Slide 13. Sales for this business were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 2.8% organically while operating income increased slightly to $342 million. Portfolio management actions, raw material benefits and the team's relentless focus on operational excellence drove a 240 basis point improvement in operating margins to 24.9%.
Organic sales declined 3% on the electronics side of the business, with electronics material solutions up slightly and display materials and systems declining.
In our energy-related businesses, organic sales were down 2%, similar to past quarters, with growth in telecom more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy.
On a geographic basis, organic growth increased in EMEA while the U.S., Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific all declined. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion, with organic growth of 5%. Organic growth was led by our stationery and office supplies business, with strong back-to-school sales in Scotch home and office tapes, Post-it and Command products. In the home improvement business, our Filtrete brand filters, which significantly improve air quality in the home, also helped to propel growth in the quarter. Our home care business also delivered positive organic growth while consumer health care declined slightly.
Looking at the business -- Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA while Latin America/Canada declined. Operating income increased to $293 million and margins were 25.2%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year.
That wraps up our review of the third quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 15, where Inge will provide an update on our 2015 planning estimates. Inge?"

Against that backdrop, today, we're updating our full year outlook for 2015. We now expect organic growth of 1.5% to 2% versus prior guidance of 2.5% to 4%. Foreign currency translation will reduce sales by approximately 7% compared with a prior range of 6% to 7%. Excluding the impact of restructuring, we expect full year earnings per share in the range of $7.73 to $7.78. We previously expected EPS in the range of $7.73 to $7.93. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.65, which reflects the expected $0.13 restructuring charge in Q4. We also now anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 100%, up from the prior range of 90% to 100%. 
So thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And trying to get a sense how much of the decline you guys think might be related to inventory destock versus actual sell-through and just the state of where you think inventories are right now.

I think first of all, when you look upon the decline in terms of IPI growth, we have all seen that going down quarter-by-quarter during the year. And that is related both to United States and to China and Germany. You can say basically on a global base. I think that has one impact. And then of course, enterprises around the world look upon their balance sheet and the cash flow and type of work down the inventory as well. So I would say when we look upon our performance in terms of growth, yes, it slowed during the year, but we don't believe and we know that we are not losing out in terms of penetration or market share, but I think it's a combination of both of them. So we clearly see a -- we're ending out the year, I would say, at a lower global growth rate in the economy versus what all of us anticipated as we went into the year. And when I look upon that, I feel personally very good of how, we as a team, and I'm talking now about all the 90,000 at 3M have been able to manage that through and improve most other metrics when it became more of a challenge for us to grow. But we are growing, right? We are growing, and we have margins expansion and very good cash flow. So -- but answer your question, I think it's a combination of both, and I think people would like to look out a couple of years now what would this mean. And I think everything you see that we have been doing this year in terms of our portfolio work and our investment in R&D and the business transformation, in addition to the announcement today of a restructuring, is for us to be prepared as we move ahead in order for us to give good return despite maybe something that has been difficult for us to control, which is the growth in IPI and GDP. So I hope that helps."

It's tough to raise prices when you have -- when you're trying to raise prices in an economy in a recession. And then at the same time, some of these countries like Brazil are kind of hard to restructure. It's not easy to fire people there either. I mean, how do you plan for it? And how do you change? I mean, do you just keep moving forward like you always have? Or do you start to think in terms of taking real fixed assets out and disinvesting in some of these areas?"

Because you -- the landscape changed and then you have to -- as I always said, if you go out in the forest and you go out with your map, and the map and the forest doesn't connect any longer. The forest is also always right, so you cannot continue with your map if you think about that as the business plan. So we are doing that. And when I look back over the years here, it's not something that we react to just today based on a quarter that is softer in one way or the other. You'll go back to China for instance. We have not added people there for 12 to 18 months. We didn't reduce by definition, but we adjusted and slowed down the way we added people. Brazil today, you're correct, Brazil today will still, in my view and I think in most of our views, be a challenge maybe for the next 2 years. And you can see also in the restructuring announcement today, we are talking about Latin America as a primary focus and inside of that is, of course, Brazil. So what you have to do is to surgically go in and address it. And I think that's serving us well with the model we have that is very much around localization. Meaning, we have a managing director in each country that is leading to operation, and there is an empowerment around that. But they get a lot of help from us, I can tell you that, Scott, in order to make sure that we take action. But you're just careful in terms of building out assets, in terms of manufacturing and so forth that you may be did differently 5, 6 years ago, and just see how you can serve those markets differently. Now you heard, as Nick said, if you take our Health Care business that is growing very well and is very profitable, they had 10% organic local currency growth in developing economies in the quarter. Consumer's doing well, et cetera. So when I look upon it, yes, there is a shift in between developed and developing, and we adjust accordingly, but we -- there are still a big penetration opportunities in those countries. But you're more cautious. You are looking upon it slightly different and make sure you position yourself for the long term."

And what has happened is, first of all, we realigned the businesses. As you maybe recall, we did that in 2000 -- late 2012. And one of the reasons for that was we reduced the number of business groups, right? So we tried to build out relevance for our customers. We reduced the number of divisions, meaning, tried to get out efficient -- more efficiency, more productivity and get more alignment with the market and the customer. So we were able to respond faster with technology platforms. If you take this specific business, Electronics and Energy, we went from 8 or 9 divisions to 4 divisions. We relentlessly looked upon the structure of it, and we reallocate assets in a better way that we had for that specific business that they have to utilize maybe in between 3 different business groups. Now we add it together so they could manage it, which helped them to drive efficiency in the manufacturing, be able to respond much faster to customer demands and also they address a lot of, I would say, issues in the portfolio, right? So you remember, we had this analysis where we had a Heartland division, strategic -- or Push Forward and then under strategic review. They addressed all of that. And as I've said earlier, and I think this is now showing again, I said in last 2 quarters that the margins for that business is now at the point that is not dependent on big growth on top line only to drive margins. So we have now proven that for the third quarter that the model is now streamlined, efficient with very good combination of manufacturing, commercialization and R&D capabilities in a very streamlined organization. And I would say -- you said -- you referred to rest of 3M, it's the same everywhere, but this business group could get a big lift because where they started. One business that we -- you see have a very good result this quarter is Consumer. Consumer 2012 also started with 8 divisions and now 4 divisions. We worked to streamline the organization. We took out unnecessary layers in the organization. We have addressed span of control and levels in the organization. And that is happening everywhere in 3M. You see bigger benefit from some short term because they had a lower starting point. But EEBG had the lowest, right? And if you're running 15.7% operating margin and are part of 3M, that is not us. And I would complement that business group for taking that on and work it through. And today, we see the result. It's nice to see."

But at this point in time, the total focus is, short term, to integrate the business, make sure we get full leverage based on what we are paid and can give back to the shareholders based on what we paid for that business. But you're right, I think you have more opportunities in businesses going versus health care, life sciences, biotech than you have, for instance, in Consumer, in Safety and Graphics. But we take it seriously now in terms of integrating the business and execute the plan as a first step, so we don't migrate the resources in R&D and start to -- they need to present very specific programs and opportunities in order to get the resources to expand the business as we move ahead. So more to come, Deane. We are now focused to integrate and -- integrate the model and execute."

And I think the important thing there was for sure not in the first category under Strategic Review. So it's a business that is doing very well. I think it's our responsibility to look upon all businesses to say can we get better benefit in a different business model? Is there more value that can be created in a different way for some of our businesses? This business could be one of them where we would like to evaluate. And as you know, it could be a spin, it could be a sell or we keep it. We are making that evaluation now, and we will know because I wouldn't like to move forward or -- and ahead of our own process. As I said in the end of Q1, we should know how the outcome of that will be. If you go back and look upon -- in my view, at least, today, we have a very good process in order to measure our businesses and try to understand where we can leverage even more. And in some cases, we have to ask the question, can we lever more and can there be more return to shareholders in a different business model? I think that's my responsibility to do. And I think it's our team's responsibility to do and then we do it. So it's not always a business that is underperforming that you need to evaluate. Sometimes in a case like this, you have to look upon it. And it had been on my mind for some time, I would say, but I'm very careful to not overload the organization, the initiatives relative to the portfolio. My first objective was to make sure that we got all businesses to a respectable position. And I think we are there now as you have seen with result in EEBG as well. And then there's a time for everything. Now we are here. We have announced it. We're transparent about it and then we have to see in the end of Q1 what the next step will be. Any case, it's a fantastic business if it's with us, if it's a spin or it's sold, it's just a fantastic -- so there's nothing wrong with this business. And it takes courage to take a step like this and have a business doing well as this is doing."
