Revenue was at the high end of the guided range and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in ahead of first call consensus. In the Broadband and Connectivity segment, revenues declined less than we initially expected. In Broadband Access, there is significant operator interest to upgrade last mile access technologies such as DSL and PON to the fastest speeds. In set-top box, developed markets are upgrading to new media server architectures, and we're starting to see the first UltraHD boxes roll out. The decline in connectivity was also more modest than we initially expected due to the success of new phone launches as well as increasing penetration of 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions. In infrastructure, our business declined as expected due to lower data center and service provider spending. For 2014, we delivered record revenues and record reportable segment profitability. Our BCG and IMG revenue grew 6% while operating profit grew 25% consistent with our goal of profitable growth. I'll go into these items in more detail later in the call, but first, I'll turn the call over to Eric for details on the fourth quarter results and on first quarter guidance."
136333,281479160,751687,"Broadcom Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. As Peter mentioned, please refer to the data breakout on the investors section of our website for additional introduction that will supplement my financial commentary. As previously discussed at our Analyst Day, we are now, including stock-",756,"Thanks, Scott. As Peter mentioned, please refer to the data breakout on the investors section of our website for additional introduction that will supplement my financial commentary. As previously discussed at our Analyst Day, we are now, including stock-based compensation in our non-GAAP operating results in addition to allocating into our reportable segments. We decided to make this change to recognize/reflect all employee costs in our results and align with many investors' financial models. Consistent with this, we have recast our segments and other non-GAAP financial information in our 10-K and web financial statements with the current and prior periods. For the purposes of comparability with external estimates and prior guidance, we are also providing the comparable non-GAAP metrics excluding stock-based compensation in the following discussion. Going forward, we will guide gross margin and R&D and SG&A expenses that includes stock-based compensation. 
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q4 revenue came in at $2.14 billion, down 5.2% sequentially and up 3.8% year-over-year. Excluding cellular baseband revenue, reportable segment revenue was down 3% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7%. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin now includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Q4 R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $46 million, including stock-based compensation. Q4 non-GAAP EPS excluding stock-based compensation was $0.90 a share or $0.03 above first call consensus of $0.87 per share. Including stock-based compensation, Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.76 a share. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.64 a share, which includes $0.09 of additional impairment and restructuring charges principally related to our exit of the cellular baseband business. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $633 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $6 billion. 
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In December, we updated our guided range for Q4 revenue to between $2.075 billion and $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue right at the high end of that range at $2.143 billion. Our Broadband and Connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectations at $1.48 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially. Upside in the quarter was in wireless connectivity and broadband. Revenue from our infrastructure networking segments, met our expectations but down sequentially at $625 million. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7% and includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. This was at the midpoint of our guided range of 55% excluding stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was up from Q3 to 52.8%. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses was slightly above our revised guidance in December and down $46 million from Q3 levels, including stock-based compensation as a couple of unplanned tape-outs occurred later in the quarter. Going forward, non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A should be the same and will be consolidated into a single estimate. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at $6 billion, of which 48% is in the U.S. Cash flow from operations was $633 million. During the quarter, we paid $72 million in dividends and repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock at a cost of $104 million. We announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.14 per share. We also continue to target repurchasing $1 billion of stock in 2015. Q4 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 34 days and net inventory turns were 7.6. 
Moving to restructuring and impairment charges. In Q4, we recorded restructuring cost of $16 million and impairment charges of $14 million as we continue to exit our wind-down of our cellular baseband business. We expect to record an additional $40 million of restructuring charges over the next 12 months primarily related to the closing or consolidation of 19 locations. 
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be $2 billion plus or minus $75 million. From a segment perspective, we expect Broadband and Connectivity to be down and Infrastructure & Networking to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat to Q4 at 54.7% plus or minus 75 basis points and GAAP gross margin to be flat as well at 52.8%, plus or minus 75 basis points. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q1 to be up between $5 million and $25 million, which again now includes stock-based compensation. And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott, who'll talk more about the state of the business."
136333,281479160,751687,"Broadcom Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Broadband and Connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected. Upside in the quarter was across the board, including set-top box, broadband ac",734,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Broadband and Connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected. Upside in the quarter was across the board, including set-top box, broadband access and particularly wireless connectivity. 
In set-top box, we're seeing growth in emerging markets in new technologies. Operators such as DISH in North America, Free [ph] in France and Tata in India have begun to offer UltraHD set-top boxes to their subscribers. We're expecting at least 15 operators across multiple regions to launch 4K television service in 2015. 
In Broadband Access, the race to give you speeds in the home continues as telcos invest in G.fast and cable MSOs invest in DOCSIS 3.1 while both invest in high-speed optical access. Broadcom is leading this transition with our first design wins with G.fast and 10 gig EPON already in place. 
In Connectivity, we saw increased demand for newly introduced smartphones combined with increasing adoption of new wireless technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions that drive higher ASPs. 5G WiFi revenues reached a record high in the quarter and more than doubled for the year. We're seeing significant customer interest in our 4x4 multiuser MIMO 5G WiFi chip, targeted for retail routers, broadband access gateways and set-top boxes. In addition, we're broadening our Connectivity business beyond smartphones into adjacent markets. For example, we are powering both [indiscernible] WiFi home audio systems. We've also received our first design win for a wireless charging solution. 
We continue to diversify into new markets such as Internet of Things, automotive wearables and small cells. In the Internet of Things market, design activity remains high with our current products, and we're in the process of refreshing our portfolio with purpose-built products that are optimized specifically for different market segments. Registrations for our wicked Internet of Things platform have grown dramatically from 2,000 at the beginning of 2014 to over 8,000 now. We announced the expansion of our distribution channel with more than 40 new partners to expand our sales reach to Internet of Things customers. 
Lastly, small cell remains an emerging opportunity. We're ramping our newly launched LTE and TD-SCDMA solutions while maintaining our market-leading position in 3G. We're starting to see increasing adoption from carriers. For example, we're working with Spider Cloud who recently announced they'll be supplying Verizon for 4G enterprise small cells. Looking into Q1, we expect our Broadband and Connectivity business to be down sequentially. 
Moving to infrastructure. Our Infrastructure & Networking group declined as expected, down 4% sequentially to $625 million. The Data Center segment was relatively stronger than the enterprise and service provider segments. In the data center market, we have a large number of customers in production with Trident II and are building a solid pipeline of design wins for Tomahawk. At 3.2 terabits per second, Tomahawk is the industry's highest bandwidth switching solution and has been shipped over 15 different networking box makers, establishing an early lead over competitors. Longer term, we remain confident in growth drivers that include new buildouts and expansions of data centers, increasing data traffic and faster speeds and ASIC conversions to merchant solutions. 
In the service provider market, we're seeing broad adoption of our 28-nanometer heterogenous knowledge-based processors. We also delivered version 2.0 of our OpenFlow SDN or software defined networking reference platform that delivers on the flexibility and control requirements for large scale carrier network deployments. 
Finally, we released an enhanced version of our broader reach ethernet product that extends our automotive market opportunity beyond infotainment and driver assistance into telematics, satellite antennas and instrumentation clusters. We currently have design wins with 5 automakers and expect solid growth this year. As we look into Q1, we expect our Infrastructure & Networking business to be roughly flat sequentially. 
In summary, our Broadband and Connectivity and our Infrastructure & Networking segments performed well during the fourth quarter, and we exceeded our expectations for both revenue and operating profits. 2014 has been the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for our Infrastructure & Networking business due to our leadership in the switch market. Broadband and Connectivity saw single digit growth in 2014 due to a strong position in the high end of the phone market and set-top box and access markets. This concludes our prepared comments, and we're now ready for your questions. Akiba, may we have the first question please."

We're also broadening our technology portfolio in Connectivity to include things like wireless charging and other technologies. So we see that business over the long term. I think this year will be potentially a little challenging, but over the long term, we see that as a growth business.

So all of those are the factors that drive growth, and many of those we don't control. But over the longer term, we do see that as a double-digit business. And when it works out to exactly this year again will depend on those factors, and it's hard for us to predict, but certainly, we see that as a double-digit growth business over a multiple year period."

That number looks like more $25-ish million. That's actually a pretty strong quarter in masks and prototyping costs as well offset by solid expense management in Q1 in other areas. So that's why you see the lower number relative to what you'd expect from the step-up. We continue to expect manage our expenses pretty tightly, and going to Q1, we'll continue to do so. As you look across the rest of the year, bear in mind that Q1 really has only 1 month of the merit increase in the number given the timing of when the merit increase is fairly distributed. So you pick up the other 2 months in Q2. So typically, it's up a little bit in Q2 as a result of that just by itself. And then, you're right, probably flat to down in the remaining quarters of the year as the fringe comes down and we sort of manage our costs pretty tightly.

We have seen that, fortunately, a lot of the baseband business that we did lose did go to people, partners who are friendly with us, and so we kept some of that connectivity. We're also seeing the connectivity businesses is doing fairly well actually. And so with some of the baseband share shifts that are going on and we expect it to go on over the next couple of years, we think that business is far stronger than certainly any worst-case projection and probably better than most of the sort of typical projections we would've seen.

I think sports is going to be a key driver of content, and then the movies I think are largely being shot in 4K today for a lot of the new movies. So you'll see that. It's amazing, the opportunities to create that. I mean you can buy 4K drones today, of very, very high-quality. And so the opportunity to create content, I think, is going up. And once the content starts cashing up, I think that's going to be where it'll kick over and you'll see widescale adoption of it because the consumers will be willing to pay incremental fees in order to get access to good quality for content"

It has, because of its high frequency, the opportunity to have very high bandwidth. Yet, it also has some challenges such as it tends to be a little more light of sight or rely on scatter and reflection. So for example, it's blocked by the human body, it's blocked by a table or furniture, and so it makes it difficult to use in many cases. I think you're going to see it, the used cases are a number. I think you'll see some cable replacement where you'll replace short range cable connections like a high-speed USB kind of connection. I think you'll see it for high-speed data backup or connectivity where you can assure a line of sight. So those will be opportunities for it there. I don't think it will replace wireless LAN. Wireless LAN has an incredible range. We got a range of wireless LAN up well over the initial 100 meter spec to 2x or 3x that, and the data rate is very higher on wireless LAN these days. So I think 60 gigahertz will tend to be specialized applications, certainly not a replacement for wireless LAN. I wouldn't be surprised you'll see devices have both in them."

We have ARM processors in quite a few of our devices actually, and many of them are multiprocessors. So for example, our set-top boxes have very, very strong multi-processor ARM cores in them. We also see an opportunity in the network space for network processors, and we've made a good effort there and we've announced a processor architecture, which is definitely superhigh performance there that competes with the highest performance processors you can get anywhere. And again, the challenge with multiprocessors is not just the speed of the processor itself but the overall system performance because you have to balance the buses for the data and the instructions and the I/O on those devices. And so we'll look to scaling that up at the very high end Infrastructure & Networking space as well as deploy it through broadband and things like set-top boxes where you run it for applications. And then also in things like Internet of Things. We have ARM processors there where we use them for the running the applications, and those tend to be very low power, very small footprint devices. So we have probably almost 2 orders of magnitude in size of these ARM cores that we use across the our whole product family."

In the Broadband and Connectivity segment, revenues declined less than we initially expected. In broadband access, there is significant operator interest to upgrade last-mile access technologies such as DSL and PON to the fastest speeds. In set-top box, developed markets are upgrading to new media server architectures, and we're starting to see the first UltraHD boxes roll out. The decline in connectivity was also more modest than we initially expected due to the success of new phone launches, as well as increasing penetration of 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions. In infrastructure, our business declined as expected due to lower data center and service provider spending. For 2014, we delivered record revenues and record reportable segment profitability. Our BCG and ING revenue grew 6% while operating profit grew 25%, consistent with our goal of profitable growth.
I'll go into these items in more detail later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Eric for details on the fourth quarter results and on first quarter guidance."

As Peter mentioned, please refer to the data breakout on the Investors section of our website for additional introduction that will supplement my financial commentary. As previously discussed at our Analyst Day, we are now including stock-based compensation in our non-GAAP operating results in addition to allocating it to our reportable segments. We decided to make this change to recognize/reflect all employee costs in our results and align with many investors' financial models. Consistent with this, we have recast our segments and other non-GAAP financial information in our 10-K and web financial statements for the current and prior periods. For the purposes of comparability with external estimates and prior guidance, we are also providing the comparable non-GAAP metrics excluding stock-based compensation in the following discussion. Going forward, we will guide gross margin and R&D and SG&A expenses that includes stock-based compensation.
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q4 revenue came in at $2.14 billion, down 5.2% sequentially and up 3.8% year-over-year. Excluding cellular baseband revenue, reportable segment revenue was down 3% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7%. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin now includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Q4 R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $46 million, including stock-based compensation. Q4 non-GAAP EPS excluding stock-based compensation was $0.90 a share or $0.03 above First Call consensus of $0.87 per share. Including stock-based compensation, Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.76 a share. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.64 a share, which includes $0.09 of additional impairment and restructuring charges principally related to our exit of the cellular baseband business. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $633 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $6 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In December, we updated our guided range for Q4 revenue to between $2.075 billion and $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue right at the high end of that range at $2.143 billion. Our Broadband and Connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectations at $1.48 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially. Upside in the quarter was in wireless connectivity and broadband modems. Revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment met our expectations of down sequentially at $625 million. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7% and includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. This was at the midpoint of our guided range of 55% excluding stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was up from Q3 to 52.8%.
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses were slightly above our revised guidance in December and down $46 million from Q3 levels, including stock-based compensation, as a couple of unplanned tape-outs occurred late in the quarter. Going forward, non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A should be the same and will be consolidated into a single estimate.
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at $6 billion, of which 48% is in the U.S. Cash flow from operations was $633 million. During the quarter, we paid $72 million in dividends and repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock at a cost of $104 million. We announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.14 per share. We also continue to target repurchasing $1 billion of stock in 2015. Q4 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 34 days and net inventory turns were 7.6.
Moving to restructuring and impairment charges. In Q4, we recorded restructuring cost of $16 million and impairment charges of $14 million as we continue to exit our wind-down of our cellular baseband business. We expect to record an additional $40 million of restructuring charges over the next 12 months, primarily related to the closing or consolidation of 19 locations.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be $2 billion, plus or minus $75 million. From a segment perspective, we expect Broadband and Connectivity to be down and Infrastructure & Networking to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat to Q4 at 54.7%, plus or minus 75 basis points. And GAAP gross margin to be flat as well at 52.8%, plus or minus 75 basis points. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q1 to be up between $5 million and $25 million, which again now includes stock-based compensation.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."
136333,281479160,751993,"Broadcom Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Broadband and Connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected.

Starting with the Broadband and Connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected. Upside in the quarter was across the board, including set-top box, broadband access and particularly wireless connectivity.
In set-top box, we're seeing growth in emerging markets and new technologies. Operators such as DISH in North America, Free in France and Tata in India have begun to offer UltraHD set-top boxes to their subscribers. We're expecting at least 15 operators across multiple regions to launch 4K television service in 2015.
In broadband access, the race to gigabit speeds in the home continues as telcos invest in G.fast and cable MSOs invest in DOCSIS 3.1, while both invest in high-speed optical access. Broadcom is leading this transition with our first design wins with G.fast and 10-gig EPON already in place.
In connectivity, we saw increased demand for newly introduced smartphones combined with increasing adoption of new wireless technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions that drive higher ASPs. 5G WiFi revenues reached a record high in the quarter and more than doubled for the year. We're seeing significant customer interest in our 4x4 multiuser MIMO 5G WiFi chip, targeted for retail routers, broadband access gateways and set-top boxes. In addition, we're broadening our connectivity business beyond smartphones into adjacent markets. For example, we are powering both Denon and Harman Kardon's WiFi home audio systems. We've also received our first design win for a wireless charging solution.
We continue to diversify into new markets such as Internet of Things, automotive, wearables and small cells. In the Internet of Things market, design activity remains high with our current products, and we're in the process of refreshing our portfolio with purpose-built products that are optimized specifically for different market segments. Registrations for our WICED Internet of Things platform have grown dramatically, from 2,000 at the beginning of 2014 to over 8,000 now. We announced the expansion of our distribution channel with more than 40 new partners to expand our sales reach to Internet of Things customers.
Lastly, small cell remains an emerging opportunity. We're ramping our newly launched LTE and TD-SCDMA solutions while maintaining our market-leading position in 3G. We're starting to see increasing adoption from carriers. For example, we're working with SpiderCloud, who recently announced they'll be supplying Verizon for 4G enterprise small cells. Looking into Q1, we expect our Broadband and Connectivity business to be down sequentially.
Moving to infrastructure. Our Infrastructure & Networking Group declined as expected, down 4% sequentially to $625 million. The data center segment was relatively stronger than the enterprise and service provider segments. In the data center market, we have a large number of customers in production with Trident II and are building a solid pipeline of design wins for Tomahawk. At 3.2 terabits per second, Tomahawk is the industry's highest bandwidth switching solution and has been shipped to over 15 different networking box makers, establishing an early lead over competitors. Longer term, we remain confident in growth drivers that include new buildouts and expansions of data centers, increasing data traffic and faster speeds and ASIC conversions to merchant solutions.
In the service provider market, we're seeing broad adoption of our 28-nanometer heterogenous knowledge-based processors. We also delivered version 2.0 of our OpenFlow SDN or software-defined networking reference platform that delivers on the flexibility and control requirements for large scale carrier network deployments.
Finally, we released an enhanced version of our BroadR-Reach Ethernet product that extends our automotive market opportunity beyond infotainment and driver assistance into telematics, satellite antennas and instrumentation clusters. We currently have design wins with 5 automakers and expect solid growth this year. As we look into Q1, we expect our Infrastructure & Networking business to be roughly flat sequentially.
In summary, our Broadband and Connectivity and our Infrastructure & Networking segments performed well during the fourth quarter, and we exceeded our expectations for both revenue and operating profits. 2014 has been the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for our Infrastructure & Networking business due to our leadership in the switch market. Broadband and Connectivity saw single-digit growth in 2014 due to a strong position in the high end of the phone market and set-top box and access markets.
This concludes our prepared comments, and we're now ready for your questions. Lakeba, may we have the first question please."

I think this year will be potentially a little challenging. But over the long term, we see that as a growth business.

With the reduction in the number of people associated with our exit from the cellular baseband, that number looks more like $25-ish million. It was actually a pretty strong quarter in masks and prototyping costs as well, offset by solid expense management in Q1 in other areas. So that's why you see the lower number relative to what you'd expect from the step-up. We continue to expect manage our expenses pretty tightly. And going into Q1, we will continue to do so. As you look across the rest of the year, bear in mind that Q1 really has only 1 month of the merit increase in the number given the timing of when the merit increase is typically distributed. So you pick up the other 2 months in Q2. So typically, it's up a little bit in Q2 as a result of that just by itself.

So they'll move from 1x1 to 2x2 and even beyond that over time. So you can see the -- what you typically see in tablets or in laptops moves into cell phones as people look for higher connectivity performance. Also driving growth is the opportunity to add additional technologies. So for us, it's an opportunity to grow share in NFC, in wireless charging and other technologies that I think will be able to contribute meaningfully going forward."

And we said that there was a $500 million to $800 million total size of the business if we lost all of the small and midrange business. So that's sort of a theoretical maximum on that. I'm not going to update the size of the bucket or where we are on that going forward, but let me try to help you a little bit here. We have seen that, fortunately, a lot of the baseband business that we did lose did go to people -- partners who are friendly with us, and so we kept some of that connectivity. We're also seeing that the connectivity business is doing fairly well actually. And so with some of the baseband share shifts that are going on, and that we expect to go on over the next couple of years, we think that business is far stronger than certainly any worst-case projection and probably better than most of the sort of typical projections we would've seen.

It has, because of its high frequency, the opportunity to have very high bandwidth. Yet, it also has some challenges such as, it tends to be a little more line of sight or rely on scatter and reflection. So for example, if it's blocked by the human body, it's blocked by a table or furniture, and so it makes it difficult to use in many cases. I think you're going to see it -- the use cases are a number. I think you'll see some cable replacement where you'll replace short range cable connections, like a high-speed USB kind of connection. I think you'll see it for high-speed data backup or connectivity, where you can assure a line of sight. So those will be opportunities for it there. I don't think it will replace wireless LAN. Wireless LAN has an incredible range. We've gotten the range of wireless LAN up well over the initial 100 meter spec to 2 or 3x that, and the data rate is very higher on wireless LAN these days. So I think 60 gigahertz will tend to be specialized applications, certainly not a replacement for wireless LAN. I wouldn't be surprised you'll see devices have both in them."

We have ARM processors in quite a few of our devices actually, and many of them are multiprocessors. So for example, our set-top boxes have very, very strong multiprocessor ARM cores in them. We also see an opportunity in the network space for network processors, and we've made a good effort there. And we've announced a processor architecture, which is definitely super-high performance there that competes with the highest performance processors you can get anywhere. And again, the challenge with multiprocessors is not just the speed of the processor itself, but the overall system performance because you have to balance the buses for the data and the instructions and the I/O on those devices. And so we'll look to scaling that up at the very high end in our Infrastructure & Networking space, as well as deploy it through broadband in things like set-top boxes, where you run it for applications. And then also in things like Internet of Things. We have ARM processors there where we use them for the running the applications. And those tend to be very low power, very small footprint devices. So we have probably almost 2 orders of magnitude in size of these ARM cores that we use across our whole product family."

Our switches are all programmable and customizable. So that's a misimpression that some people have gotten. We haven't seen much competition on the high end, and we've certainly seen announcements, but to my knowledge, they haven't sampled yet. So our experience is generally from the time you actually sample and get it into customers' hands, it's a year or 18 months before you see shipment and revenue on that.

In terms of the way we recognize revenue, we do still, and have, for as long as I've been here, recognize revenue on a sell-through basis. So what we ship to the distributors is not recorded as revenue until they actually sell out.

Revenue was at the high end of the guided range and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in ahead of First Call consensus. In the Broadband and Connectivity segment, revenues declined less than we initially expected. In broadband access, there is significant operator interest to upgrade last-mile access technologies such as DSL and PON to the fastest speeds. In set-top box, developed markets are upgrading to new media server architectures, and we're starting to see the first UltraHD boxes roll out. The decline in connectivity was also more modest than we initially expected due to the success of new phone launches, as well as increasing penetration of 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions. In infrastructure, our business declined as expected due to lower data center and service provider spending. For 2014, we delivered record revenues and record reportable segment profitability.

Consistent with this, we have recast our segments and other non-GAAP financial information in our 10-K and web financial statements for the current and prior periods. For the purposes of comparability with external estimates and prior guidance, we are also providing the comparable non-GAAP metrics excluding stock-based compensation in the following discussion. Going forward, we will guide gross margin and R&D and SG&A expenses that includes stock-based compensation.
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q4 revenue came in at $2.14 billion, down 5.2% sequentially and up 3.8% year-over-year. Excluding cellular baseband revenue, reportable segment revenue was down 3% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7%. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin now includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Q4 R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $46 million, including stock-based compensation. Q4 non-GAAP EPS excluding stock-based compensation was $0.90 a share or $0.03 above First Call consensus of $0.87 per share. Including stock-based compensation, Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.76 a share. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.64 a share, which includes $0.09 of additional impairment and restructuring charges principally related to our exit of the cellular baseband business. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $633 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $6 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In December, we updated our guided range for Q4 revenue to between $2.075 billion and $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue right at the high end of that range at $2.143 billion. Our Broadband and Connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectations at $1.48 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially. Upside in the quarter was in wireless connectivity and broadband modems. Revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment met our expectations of down sequentially at $625 million. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7% and includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. This was at the midpoint of our guided range of 55% excluding stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was up from Q3 to 52.8%.
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses were slightly above our revised guidance in December and down $46 million from Q3 levels, including stock-based compensation as a couple of unplanned tape-outs occurred late in the quarter. Going forward, non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A should be the same and will be consolidated into a single estimate.
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at $6 billion, of which 48% is in the U.S. Cash flow from operations was $633 million. During the quarter, we paid $72 million in dividends and repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock at a cost of $104 million. We announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.14 per share. We also continue to target repurchasing $1 billion of stock in 2015. Q4 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 34 days and net inventory turns were 7.6.
Moving to restructuring and impairment charges. In Q4, we recorded restructuring cost of $16 million and impairment charges of $14 million as we continue to exit our wind-down of our cellular baseband business. We expect to record an additional $40 million of restructuring charges over the next 12 months, primarily related to the closing or consolidation of 19 locations.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be $2 billion, plus or minus $75 million. From a segment perspective, we expect Broadband and Connectivity to be down and Infrastructure & Networking to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat to Q4 at 54.7%, plus or minus 75 basis points. And GAAP gross margin to be flat as well at 52.8%, plus or minus 75 basis points. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q1 to be up between $5 million and $25 million, which again now includes stock-based compensation.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Broadband and Connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected. Upside in the quarter was across the board, including set-top box, broadband ac",731,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Broadband and Connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected. Upside in the quarter was across the board, including set-top box, broadband access and particularly wireless connectivity.
In set-top box, we're seeing growth in emerging markets and new technologies. Operators such as DISH in North America, Free in France and Tata in India have begun to offer UltraHD set-top boxes to their subscribers. We're expecting at least 15 operators across multiple regions to launch 4K television service in 2015.
In broadband access, the race to gigabit speeds in the home continues as telcos invest in G.fast and cable MSOs invest in DOCSIS 3.1, while both invest in high-speed optical access. Broadcom is leading this transition with our first design wins with G.fast and 10-gig EPON already in place.
In connectivity, we saw increased demand for newly introduced smartphones combined with increasing adoption of new wireless technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions that drive higher ASPs. 5G WiFi revenues reached a record high in the quarter and more than doubled for the year. We're seeing significant customer interest in our 4x4 multiuser MIMO 5G WiFi chip, targeted for retail routers, broadband access gateways and set-top boxes. In addition, we're broadening our connectivity business beyond smartphones into adjacent markets. For example, we are powering both Denon and Harman Kardon's WiFi home audio systems. We've also received our first design win for our wireless charging solution.
We continue to diversify into new markets such as Internet of Things, automotive, wearables and small cells. In the Internet of Things market, design activity remains high with our current products, and we're in the process of refreshing our portfolio with purpose-built products that are optimized specifically for different market segments. Registrations for our WICED Internet of Things platform have grown dramatically, from 2,000 at the beginning of 2014 to over 8,000 now. We announced the expansion of our distribution channel with more than 40 new partners to expand our sales reach to Internet of Things customers.
Lastly, small cell remains an emerging opportunity. We're ramping our newly launched LTE and TD-SCDMA solutions while maintaining our market-leading position in 3G. We're starting to see increasing adoption from carriers. For example, we're working with SpiderCloud, who recently announced they'll be supplying Verizon for 4G enterprise small cells. Looking into Q1, we expect our Broadband and Connectivity business to be down sequentially.
Moving to infrastructure. Our Infrastructure & Networking Group declined as expected, down 4% sequentially to $625 million. The data center segment was relatively stronger than the enterprise and service provider segments. In the data center market, we have a large number of customers in production with Trident II and are building a solid pipeline of design wins for Tomahawk. At 3.2 terabits per second, Tomahawk is the industry's highest bandwidth switching solution and has been shipped to over 15 different networking box makers, establishing an early lead over competitors. Longer term, we remain confident in growth drivers that include new buildouts and expansions of data centers, increasing data traffic and faster speeds and ASIC conversions to merchant solutions.
In the service provider market, we're seeing broad adoption of our 28-nanometer heterogenous knowledge-based processors. We also delivered version 2.0 of our OpenFlow SDN or software-defined networking reference platform that delivers on the flexibility and control requirements for large scale carrier network deployments.
Finally, we released an enhanced version of our BroadR-Reach ethernet product that extends our automotive market opportunity beyond infotainment and driver assistance into telematics, satellite antennas and instrumentation clusters. We currently have design wins with 5 automakers and expect solid growth this year. As we look into Q1, we expect our Infrastructure & Networking business to be roughly flat sequentially.
In summary, our Broadband and Connectivity and our Infrastructure & Networking segments performed well during the fourth quarter, and we exceeded our expectations for both revenue and operating profits. 2014 has been the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for our Infrastructure & Networking business due to our leadership in the switch market. Broadband and Connectivity saw single-digit growth in 2014 due to a strong position in the high end of the phone market and set-top box and access markets.
This concludes our prepared comments, and we're now ready for your questions. Lakeba, may we have the first question please."

It was actually a pretty strong quarter in masks and prototyping costs as well, offset by solid expense management in Q1 in other areas. So that's why you see the lower number relative to what you'd expect from the step-up. We continue to expect manage our expenses pretty tightly. And going into Q1, we will continue to do so. As you look across the rest of the year, bear in mind that Q1 really has only 1 month of the merit increase in the number given the timing of when the merit increase is typically distributed. So you pick up the other 2 months in Q2. So typically, it's up a little bit in Q2 as a result of that just by itself. And then, you're right, probably flat to down in the remaining quarters of the year as the fringe comes down and we sort of manage our costs pretty tightly.

And we said that there was a $500 million to $800 million total size of the business if we lost all of the small and midrange business. So that's sort of a theoretical maximum on that. I'm not going to update the size of the bucket or where we are on that going forward, but let me try to help you a little bit here. We have seen that, fortunately, a lot of the baseband business that we did lose did go to people -- partners who are friendly with us, and so we kept some of that connectivity. We're also seeing that the connectivity business is doing fairly well actually. And so with some of the baseband share shifts that are going on, and that we expect to go on over the next couple of years, we think that business is far stronger than certainly any worst-case projection and probably better than most of the sort of typical projections we would've seen. So a very good situation in the connectivity, and I see that as continuing. And I believe that will turn into a growth business for us over the course of the next couple of years."

We've definitely seen the data center as the larger driver of the growth recently. And based on the CapEx forecast I've seen, that's probably going to be certainly true in the near term.

I think Internet of Things is going to be an important driver going forward. A little hard to predict this year. We're seeing some interesting devices come out. The watch business is an interesting business. Hard to forecast, but certainly, there's some people out there who see high forecast in that. And I think we'd certainly get a piece of that.

It has, because of its high frequency, the opportunity to have very high bandwidth. Yet, it also has some challenges such as, it tends to be a little more line of sight or rely on scatter and reflection. So for example, if it's blocked by the human body, it's blocked by a table or furniture, and so it makes it difficult to use in many cases. I think you're going to see it -- the use cases are a number. I think you'll see some cable replacement where you'll replace short range cable connections, like a high-speed USB kind of connection. I think you'll see it for high-speed data backup or connectivity, where you can assure a line of sight. So those will be opportunities for it there. I don't think it will replace wireless LAN. Wireless LAN has an incredible range. We've gotten the range of wireless LAN up well over the initial 100 meter spec to 2 or 3x that, and the data rate is very higher on wireless LAN these days. So I think 60 gigahertz will tend to be specialized applications, certainly not a replacement for wireless LAN. I wouldn't be surprised you'll see devices have both in them."

We have ARM processors in quite a few of our devices actually, and many of them are multiprocessors. So for example, our set-top boxes have very, very strong multiprocessor ARM cores in them. We also see an opportunity in the network space for network processors, and we've made a good effort there. And we've announced a processor architecture, which is definitely super-high performance there that competes with the highest performance processors you can get anywhere. And again, the challenge with multiprocessors is not just the speed of the processor itself, but the overall system performance because you have to balance the buses for the data and the instructions in the I/O on those devices. And so we'll look to scaling that up at the very high end in our Infrastructure & Networking space, as well as deploy it through broadband in things like set-top boxes, where you run it for applications. And then also in things like Internet of Things. We have ARM processors there where we use them for the running the applications. And those tend to be very low power, very small footprint devices. So we have probably almost 2 orders of magnitude in size of these ARM cores that we use across our whole product family."

Our switches are all programmable and customizable. So that's a misimpression that some people have gotten. We haven't seen much competition on the high end, and we've certainly seen announcements, but to my knowledge, they haven't sampled yet. So our experience is generally from the time you actually sample and get it into customers' hands, it's a year or 18 months before you see shipment and revenue on that.

Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q1 came in at $2.06 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding cellular baseband revenue, reportable segment revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 54.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%.
Q1 R&D plus SG&A expense of $716 million is down over $100 million from a year ago and up $13 million from Q4. Reportable segment operating margin was 20%, up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our plan to drive profitable growth.
Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 per share or $0.04 above First Call consensus of $0.60 per share. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.34 per share, which includes $0.23 of impairment charges.
Cash flow from operations used $25 million in Q1. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $5.5 billion. I will provide additional commentary on this in a moment.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 revenue of $2 billion plus or minus $75 million. We delivered revenue just below the high end of the range at $2.06 billion. Our broadband and connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectation at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Upside was driven by wireless connectivity and broadband modems.
Our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was $631 million, up 6% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was down 30 basis points from Q4 to 54.4% within our guided range of 54.7% plus or minus 75 basis points. Our Q1 GAAP gross margin was flat from Q4 at 52.8%.
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were in line with our guidance.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Cash flow from operations used $25 million. In April 2015, we transitioned to a new enterprise resource planning system. In preparation, we intentionally took certain measures that impacted our cash flow from operations in the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, by over $400 million. We built additional inventory and paid certain liabilities earlier than we otherwise would have to help ease this transition. We expect this to reverse in the coming quarters.
Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $5.5 billion, of which 46% is in the U.S. During the quarter, we paid $84 million in dividends and repurchased 8 million shares of stock at the cost of roughly $350 million. As previously discussed in our 10-K regarding the construction of our new corporate campus, in Q1 we paid $156 million for the purchase of land and related prepaid assets.
Q1 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 36 days, and net inventory turns were 6.2.
Moving to impairment of purchased intangibles. During the quarter, we recorded impairment charge of $143 million or $0.23 per share primarily related to our NetLogic acquisition. The impairment was principally driven by a reduction in size of the addressable market for merchant KBP. For further discussion of the preceding charges, please see our 10-Q that we anticipate filing today.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be $2.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Segment perspective, sequentially we expect Broadband and Connectivity to be flat to up slightly and infrastructure networking to be up. We expect Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 56% plus or minus 75 basis points and GAAP gross margins to be about 1.5 points lower. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to be down roughly $15 million plus or minus $10 million.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Our connec",691,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with our Broadband and Connectivity business, revenue came in at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year and down 4.5% sequentially.
Offsetting the quarter was primarily driven by wireless connectivity and broadband access. Our connectivity business continues to strengthen. We've seen 2 sequential quarters of year-over-year revenue growth driven by consumer adoption of new high-end phones, growing penetration of new technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 and the ramp of new highly integrated products such as our location hub at ultra higher ASPs. We've seen significant customer interest in our latest 5G WiFi chip that offers an industry-first real simultaneous dual band or RSDB. This technology is expected to shift later this year and allows a smartphone or tablet to transfer data across 2 bands at the same time enabling new applications and increasing performance of existing applications. We also expect our new location hub product that enables always on location-based application will broaden out to more customers and phone models over the course of this year. Outside of smartphones, we're seeing a lot of activity in the Internet of Things market. We shipped a large number of wicked development kit, which are a complete hardware and software solution for prototyping IoT products.
We continue to garner new design wins in a broad set of verticals ranging across automotive, medical devices, healthcare, life goods and home automation.
In broadband, growth is being driven by pay-TV and broadband access subscriber additions, the emerging markets, technology upgrades to VDSL with vectoring and bonding and the proliferation of pond technology in China. On a year-over-year basis, combined revenue from set-top box and broadband modems were up double-digit percentages, while broadband modems actually grew sequentially versus the typical seasonal decline in Q1.
Looking forward, we see growth drivers including emerging markets, new media server architectures and new technologies such as UltraHD and HEVC. UltraHD and HEVC are still in the early adoption phase and are expected to drive growth for many years to come.
Finally, our emerging businesses of home networking and small cells are expected to be solid growth drivers as well. We're excited about the recent announcement that Cisco will be partnering up with SpiderCloud to deliver Broadcom-based small cell solutions.
Looking at Q2, we expect our Broadband and Connectivity business to be flat to up slightly sequential.
Moving to infrastructure. Revenue in our Infrastructure & Networking group came in as expected at $631 million, up 6% year-over-year and slightly up sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by our switch and 5 [ph] products in the data center and enterprise markets.
On a sequential basis, our enterprise growth was driven by ramps and new product introductions to customers where we expect to gain market share.
Our switching business delivered record revenue and better-than-seasonal growth in the March quarter. We recently started sampling next-generation products in the StrataDNX and StrataSGX families. In the StrataDNX family, new products target data center and service provider applications and will help drive transitions from in-house -- to merchant solutions.
Broadcom introduced 8 new switch products over the past year to even further expand and strengthen our portfolio. Yesterday, we announced Trident-II plus, which is a pin-for-pin compatible upgrade to our Trident-II switch chip targeting 10- and 40-gig data center applications that offers lower power and an enhanced feature set. These products are complementary to our Tomahawk solution that targets 25-gig data center applications and which is well on its way towards production shipments later on this year.
As we look into Q2, we expect our Infrastructure and Networking business to be up sequentially.
In summary, we saw a strong start to 2015. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS ahead of expectations in the first quarter and see solid trends into Q2. We saw year-on-year profitable growth in both of our reportable segments in the March quarter as Broadband and Connectivity and Infrastructure & Networking delivered operating profit ahead of revenue growth. These results reflect our business objective to deliver top line growth along with operating margin leverage. This concludes our prepared comments and now we're ready for your questions. Leslie, may we have the first question, please?"

So those designs, a lot of them are already won and you'll start to see those roll out over the course of time, and it's certainly good for us because it's higher ASP opportunity and also opportunity to win some customers we didn't have before.

We were up roughly $20 million in employee costs minus the reduction of the cellular people that left between Q4 and Q1. So in Q4, we had about 200 people left principally statutory people and Q1, we sort of ended with about 15 people. So that knocked out about a couple of $3 million, $4 million. Stock-based compensation was favorable, as you can see from the data down about $6 million, $7 million quarter-on-quarter. And I expect stock-based compensation to be relatively flat going into Q2, pretty flattish for the year. The only wildcard on stock-based competition is we have a 2-year employee stock purchase plan, which comes up in Q4 this year, which could have some changes to it but not significant. So that's sort of what was going on. It was a pretty strong taped-out quarter. We were up meaningfully in tape-out, so we had some offsets in Q1 from NRE which we are anticipating. But again, rolling into Q2, I expect you'll see that number come down. And probably the best way to look at it is the page that we provide in the Q or the tables we provided in the Q and look at the design development costs. They look relatively flat but again underneath that is pretty big takeouts in 1 quarter offset by some NRE going into Q2 probably with a fair bit less on the tape-out side because again it's lumpy based on sort of the timing when these programs get done."

We did highlight that there was about $100 million worth of business that was directly attached to our baseband and that, that would depend on who won that business. It turns out most of the people who won that business were partners with us on connectivity.

The strength of data center, for example, hyper scale that would really pull in that ramp profile?

And we've seen different strengths from each of those segments. We're roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in each of those. And so it's given us an opportunity there. The new products that we're announcing today, I think you for us or for our competitors or anyone else, it basically takes about a year from when you have your product in hand until the customer can shift in revenue, and then it takes a while for the revenue to ramp, and then it persists over a long period of time if you have a good ship. They don't need to replace it, they run with it for a while. And you're right, that Analyst Day slide, I think is a really good example of that. What you're seeing is both a combination of strength in the market and all the chips like Trident, the original Trident, the original Dune ships and other things are really hitting their stride now in the middle of those periods. So that gives us the strength now, and we're now putting the design wins in place with an even a broader set of products, which includes Tomahawk and the new DNX products and other things that really allow us to do that. And so that's what enables us to get record switch revenue that we saw in the quarter and above seasonal growth just with the combination of breadth of product portfolio now and several years back, all adding up and giving us the strength there. And it's a very good leading indicator for the next 5 years in that business. That should be very strong for us. In terms of M&A, we certainly look for opportunities. Broadcom sweet spot on M&A is we look to buy smaller or medium-sized near revenue or early stage revenue companies. That's our sweet spot. And we look for those when. We find good ones, we buy them. We always look at other opportunities, but we haven't been as successful buying some larger things recently that hasn't worked out as well for us, so we're probably a little bit more cautious on that than we've been in the past. But certainly to the extent we find opportunities we think really creation of our value, we'll look at those and execute to make sense."

But I wanted to use switch the focus to high end in the years gone by when this last Q, beginning of the year, you used to say hey at the high end I feel comfortable keeping my share. But now that you have the sensor -- the sensor hub design win as well, does that change and make your high end also so stickier than in the past? That was my first question. And the second one is really getting back to the discussion you had a while just moments ago on M&A. Another impairment charge, why in dribbles?

We had really competitive products there, and I think what we've been able to successfully do is to continue to drive the technology roadmap forward in that space to create compelling offerings for our customers. The combination of that plus a really rich product family where they can mix and match between all different kinds of combo and discrete products, adding things like sensor hub actually does make things more sticky because for example, the sensor hub is a perfect combination with GPS. And to give you an example of why that makes sense is if you think about the GPS in your phone, it has to use a fairly significant amount of power to go get a fix on the satellites and determine the location. And 1 of the things we can do integrating the sensor hubs is we can integrate the data from all the accelerometers in the phone and conclude that you're sitting on your chair, you probably haven't moved more than 5 feet and so you probably don't need to do a new GPS fix. And so by eliminating the need to do those on location calculations and not having to wake up the main baseband processor, that really saves a lot of power in the phone and it's clear win. So that allows you to, for example, combine a sensor hub with a GPS into a very effective solution, even though it's not immediately obvious that those will go well together. They do actually go very well together in terms of a better solution for the customers. So yes, I would say our high-end business is as a strong as ever. Eric, do you want to..."

Things like processors or big switches or fabric chips are very large chips. They are very performance-sensitive and they're not as price-sensitive. And so those are chips that are perfect to go to newer, smaller nodes as quickly as we can. And so you should expect that it will move our switch chips and other process-intensive switch -- intensive devices to small nodes fairly quickly. On the other hand, there are products that are either extremely cost sensitive or simply just don't get the benefit of nodes like connectivity, for example, does not benefit by moving to 60-nanometer right now because the cost equation makes that unattractive. So we believe, as Henry said, the 28-nanometer will be a very long-lived node for us. They'll be products or probably still be doing products a few years from now on that node. But then some of other more advanced products will move quickly to other nodes. We do believe we're beginning to see an end to the everything gets better, every process generation and in particular cost per transistor is 1 of the things that started to increase. And if you don't need the performance improvement or require the shrink to get better yields on your chip or something, you'll probably stay a little further back in the nodes, which I guess is good for the foundry folks because they can run their fabs longer and the depreciation equation is probably a little better for them if they can run the nodes longer. So a silver lining for our foundry partner."

It turns out that we turn the system on and it's operating just fine.

Broadcom's business units are performing well. Broadband and Connectivity saw double-digit percentage growth year-over-year in both revenue and operating profit and delivered revenue ahead of expectations in the March quarter. Connectivity upside was driven by successful new smartphone launches and increasing penetration of 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions. We've now seen 2 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in our connectivity portfolio.
In infrastructure, year-over-year growth is being driven by our world-class switch products in the data center and enterprise markets.

As a reminder, we are now including stock-based compensation in our non-GAAP operating results in addition to allocating it to our reportable segments.
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q1 came in at $2.06 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding cellular baseband revenue, reportable segment revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 54.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%.
Q1 R&D plus SG&A expense of $716 million is down over $100 million from a year ago and up $13 million from Q4. Reportable segment operating margin was 20%, up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our plan to drive profitable growth.
Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 per share or $0.04 above First Call consensus of $0.60 per share. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.34 per share, which includes $0.23 of impairment charges.
Cash flow from operations used $25 million in Q1. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $5.5 billion. I will provide additional commentary on this in a moment.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 revenue of $2 billion plus or minus $75 million. We delivered revenue just below the high end of the range at $2.06 billion. Our Broadband and Connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectation at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Upside was driven by wireless connectivity and broadband modems.
Our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was $631 million, up 6% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was down 30 basis points from Q4 to 54.4% within our guided range of 54.7% plus or minus 75 basis points. Our Q1 GAAP gross margin was flat from Q4 at 52.8%.
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were in line with our guidance.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Cash flow from operations used $25 million. In April 2015, we transitioned to a new enterprise resource planning system. In preparation, we intentionally took certain measures that impacted our cash flow from operations in the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, by over $400 million. We built additional inventory and paid certain liabilities earlier than we otherwise would have to help ease this transition. We expect this to reverse in the coming quarters.
Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $5.5 billion, of which 46% is in the U.S. During the quarter, we paid $84 million in dividends and repurchased 8 million shares of stock at a cost of roughly $350 million. As previously discussed in our 10-K regarding the construction of our new corporate campus, in Q1, we paid $156 million for the purchase of land and related prepaid assets.
Q1 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 36 days, and net inventory turns were 6.2.
Moving to impairment of purchased intangibles. During the quarter, we recorded impairment charge of $143 million or $0.23 per share, primarily related to our NetLogic acquisition. The impairment was principally driven by a reduction in size of the addressable market for merchant KBP. For further discussion of the preceding charges, please see our 10-Q that we anticipate filing today.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be $2.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Segment perspective, sequentially, we expect Broadband and Connectivity to be flat to up slightly and Infrastructure & Networking to be up. We expect Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 56% plus or minus 75 basis points and GAAP gross margin to be about 1.5 points lower. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to be down roughly $15 million plus or minus $10 million.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with our Broadband and Connectivity business, revenue came in at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year and down 4.5% sequentially. Offsetting the quarter was primarily driven by wireless connectivity and broadband access. 
Our connectivity business continues to strengthen. We've seen 2 sequential quarters of year-over-year revenue growth driven by consumer adoption of new high-end phones, growing penetration of new technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 and the ramp of new highly integrated products such as our location hub that all drive higher ASPs. 
We're seeing significant customer interest in our latest 5G WiFi chip that offers an industry-first Real Simultaneous Dual Band or RSDB. This technology is expected to shift later this year and allows a smartphone or a tablet to transfer data across 2 bands at the same time, enabling new applications and increasing performance of existing applications. 
We also expect our new location hub product that enables always-on location-based applications will broaden out to more customers and phone models over the course of this year. 
Outside of smartphones, we're seeing a lot of activity in the Internet of Things market. We shipped a large number of WICED development kits, which are a complete hardware and software solution for prototyping IoT products. We continue to garner new design wins in a broad set of verticals ranging across automotive, medical devices, health care, white goods and home automation.
In broadband, growth is being driven by pay-TV and broadband access subscriber additions, emerging markets, technology upgrades to VDSL with vectoring and bonding and the proliferation of PON technology in China. On a year-over-year basis, combined revenue from set-top box and broadband modems were up double-digit percentages, while broadband modems actually grew sequentially versus the typical seasonal decline in Q1.
Looking forward, we see growth drivers including emerging markets, new media server architectures and new technologies such as UltraHD and HEVC. UltraHD and HEVC are still in the early adoption phase and are expected to drive growth for many years to come.
Finally, our emerging businesses of home networking and small cells are expected to be solid growth drivers as well. We're excited about the recent announcement that Cisco will be partnering up with SpiderCloud to deliver Broadcom-based small cell solutions.
Looking at Q2, we expect our Broadband and Connectivity business to be flat to up slightly sequential.
Moving to infrastructure. Revenue in our Infrastructure & Networking group came in as expected at $631 million, up 6% year-over-year and slightly up sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by our switch and PHY products in the data center and enterprise markets.
On a sequential basis, our enterprise growth was driven by ramps and new product introductions to customers where we expect to gain market share.
Our switching business delivered record revenue and better-than-seasonal growth in the March quarter. We recently started sampling next-generation products in the StrataDNX and StrataXGS families. 
In the StrataDNX family, new products target data center and service provider applications and will help drive transitions from in-house ASICs to merchant solutions.
Broadcom introduced 8 new switch products over the past year to even further expand and strengthen our portfolio. Yesterday, we announced Trident II plus, which is a pin-for-pin compatible upgrade to our Trident II switch chip targeting 10- and 40-gig data center applications that offers lower power and an enhanced feature set. These products are complementary to our Tomahawk solution that targets 25-gig data center applications and which is well on its way towards production shipment later this year.
As we look into Q2, we expect our Infrastructure & Networking business to be up sequentially.
In summary, we saw a strong start to 2015. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS ahead of expectations in the first quarter and see solid trends into Q2. We saw year-on-year profitable growth in both of our reportable segments in the March quarter as Broadband and Connectivity and Infrastructure & Networking delivered operating profit ahead of revenue growth. These results reflect our business objective to deliver top line growth along with operating margin leverage.

The only wildcard on stock-based competition is we have a 2-year employee stock purchase plan, which comes up in Q4 of this year, which could have some changes to it but not significant. So that's sort of what was going on. It was a pretty strong taped-out quarter. We were up meaningfully in tape-out, so we had some offsets in Q1 from NRE which we are anticipating. But again, rolling into Q2, I expect you'll see that number come down. And probably the best way to look at it is the page that we provide in the Q or the tables we provide in the Q and look at the design development costs.

And yes, of course, the new ones replace our old ones, but at the same time, they grow the market much bigger than it was prior."

And how should we think about share count and the buyback trajectory for the rest of the year? And then the big picture question for Scott. Scott, when I look at Street expectations for Broadcom for the next 2 years, it's about 4% to 5% annual growth. I know you don't guide out more than a quarter, but is that 4% to 5% acceptable top line growth for Broadcom? Or do you think that once the baseband numbers are out, Broadcom should be able to grow in line or better than the semiconductor market, which is more like 6% to 7%?"

The answer seemed to describe the breadth -- the incremental breadth that those are providing in the marketplace. My question is more on the duration of the opportunity. If I go back to Analyst Day, Rajiv had a slide that showed that the average revenue life for his products is around 7 years, with the ramp-up going to the first 3 or 4 years. Is that way to think about these new products? Or is there something happening with the end markets now, the strength of data center, for example, hyperscaled, that would really pull in that ramp profile? And then the follow-up question would be for both you and Eric, and that is with all of the M&A activity that's continuing this year, does that cause Broadcom to think any differently about that strategy?"

And we've seen different strengths from each of those segments. We're roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in each of those. And so it's given us an opportunity there. But the new products that we're announcing today, I think for us or for our competitors or anyone else, it basically takes about a year from when you have your product in hand until the customer can shift in revenue. And then it takes a while for the revenue to ramp. And then it persists over a long period of time if you have a good chip. They don't need to replace it. They run with it for a while. And you're right, that Analyst Day slide, I think, is a really good example of that. What you're seeing is both a combination of strength in the market and all the chips, like Trident, the original Trident, the original Dune chips and other things, are really hitting their stride now in the middle of those periods. So that gives us the strength now. And we're now putting the design wins in place with an even a broader set of products, which includes Tomahawk and the new DNX products and other things that really allow us to do that. And so that's what enables us to get record switch revenue that we saw in the quarter and above seasonal growth just with a combination of breadth of product portfolio now and several years back, all adding up and giving us the strength there. And it's a very good leading indicator for the next 5 years in that business. It should be very strong for us. In terms of M&A, we certainly look for opportunities. Broadcom sweet spot on M&A is we look to buy small or medium-sized near revenue or early-stage revenue companies. That's our sweet spot. And we look for those. When we find good ones, we buy them. We always look at other opportunities. But we haven't been as successful buying some larger things recently that hasn't worked out as well for us. So we're probably a little more cautious on that than we've been in the past. But certainly, to the extent we find opportunities we think really create shareholder value, we'll look at those and execute if they make sense."

And I think what we've been able to successfully do is to continue to drive the technology road map forward in that space to create compelling offerings for our customers. The combination of that, plus a really rich product family where they can mix and match between all different kinds of combo and discrete products, adding things like sensor hub, actually does make things more sticky because, for example, the sensor hub is a perfect combination with GPS. And to give you an example of why that makes sense is if you think about a GPS in your phone, it has to use a fairly significant amount of power to go get a fix on the satellites and determine a location. And one of the things we can do by integrating the sensor hubs is we can integrate the data from all the accelerometers in the phone and conclude that you're sitting on your chair, you probably haven't moved more than 5 feet and so you probably don't need to do a new GPS fix. And so by eliminating the need to do those location calculations and not having to wake up the main baseband processor, that really saves a lot of power in the phone and it's clear win. So that allows you to, for example, combine a sensor hub with a GPS into a very effective solution, even though it's not immediately obvious that those will go well together. They do actually go very well together in terms of a better solution for the customers. So yes, I would say our high-end business is as strong as ever. Eric, do you want to..."

Things like processors or big switches or fabric chips are very large chips. They are very performance-sensitive, and they're not as price-sensitive. And so those are chips that are perfect to go to newer, smaller nodes as quickly as we can. And so you should expect it will move our switch chips and other process-intensive switch -- intensive devices to small nodes fairly quickly. On the other hand, there are products that are either extremely cost-sensitive or simply just don't get the benefit of the nodes. It's like connectivity, for example, does not benefit by moving to 60-nanometer right now because the cost equation makes that unattractive. So we believe, as Henry said, the 28-nanometer will be a very long-lived node for us. They'll be products -- we'll probably still be doing products a few years from now on that node. But then some of our other more advanced products will move quickly to other nodes. We do believe that we're beginning to see an end to the everything gets better, every process generation. And in particular, cost per transistor is one of the things that is starting to increase. And if you don't need the performance improvement or require the shrink to get better yields on your chip or something, you'll probably stay a little further back in the nodes, which I guess is good for the foundry folks because they can run their fabs longer and the depreciation equation is probably a little better for them if they can run the nodes longer. So a silver lining for our foundry partner."

But if you look at the products coming out of Xiaomi or out of Huawei or Lenovo, I mean, a lot of those guys have decided they want to focus more on the high-end market, and they're doing great products. And so actually, we've seen an increased opportunity in all those customers because as they look to build higher-end products or they look to also support the export market outside of China, they really want the better specs that they get from our products and the better carrier acceptance.

Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q1 came in at $2.06 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding cellular baseband revenue, reportable segment revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 54.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%.
Q1 R&D plus SG&A expense of $716 million is down over $100 million from a year ago and up $13 million from Q4. Reportable segment operating margin was 20%, up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our plan to drive profitable growth.
Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 per share or $0.04 above First Call consensus of $0.60 per share. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.34 per share, which includes $0.23 of impairment charges.
Cash flow from operations used $25 million in Q1. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $5.5 billion. I will provide additional commentary on this in a moment.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 revenue of $2 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We delivered revenue just below the high end of the range at $2.06 billion. Our Broadband and Connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectation at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Upside was driven by wireless connectivity and broadband modems.
Our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was $631 million, up 6% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was down 30 basis points from Q4 to 54.4% within our guided range of 54.7%, plus or minus 75 basis points. Our Q1 GAAP gross margin was flat from Q4 at 52.8%.
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were in line with our guidance.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Cash flow from operations used $25 million. In April 2015, we transitioned to a new enterprise resource planning system. In preparation, we intentionally took certain measures that impacted our cash flow from operations in the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, by over $400 million. We built additional inventory and paid certain liabilities earlier than we otherwise would have to help ease this transition. We expect this to reverse in the coming quarters.
Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $5.5 billion, of which 46% is in the U.S. During the quarter, we paid $84 million in dividends and repurchased 8 million shares of stock at a cost of roughly $350 million. As previously discussed in our 10-K regarding the construction of our new corporate campus, in Q1, we paid $156 million for the purchase of land and related prepaid assets.
Q1 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 36 days, and net inventory turns were 6.2.
Moving to impairment of purchased intangibles. During the quarter, we recorded impairment charge of $143 million or $0.23 per share, primarily related to our NetLogic acquisition. The impairment was principally driven by a reduction in size of the addressable market for merchant KBP. For further discussion of the preceding charges, please see our 10-Q that we anticipate filing today.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Segment perspective, sequentially, we expect Broadband and Connectivity to be flat to up slightly and Infrastructure & Networking to be up. We expect Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 56% plus or minus 75 basis points and GAAP gross margin to be about 1.5 points lower. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to be down roughly $15 million, plus or minus $10 million.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with our Broadband and Connectivity business, revenue came in at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year and down 4.5% sequentially. Offsetting the quarter was primarily driven by wireless connectivity and broadband access. 
Our connectivity business continues to strengthen. We've seen 2 sequential quarters of year-over-year revenue growth driven by consumer adoption of new high-end phones, growing penetration of new technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 and the ramp of new highly integrated products such as our location hub that all drive higher ASPs. 
We're seeing significant customer interest in our latest 5G WiFi chip that offers an industry-first Real Simultaneous Dual Band or RSDB. This technology is expected to ship later this year and allows a smartphone or a tablet to transfer data across 2 bands at the same time, enabling new applications and increasing performance of existing applications. 
We also expect our new location hub product that enables always-on location-based applications will broaden out to more customers and phone models over the course of this year. 
Outside of smartphones, we're seeing a lot of activity in the Internet of Things market. We shipped a large number of WICED development kits, which are a complete hardware and software solution for prototyping IoT products. We continue to garner new design wins in a broad set of verticals ranging across automotive, medical devices, health care, white goods and home automation.
In broadband, growth is being driven by pay-TV and broadband access subscriber additions in emerging markets, technology upgrades to VDSL with vectoring and bonding and the proliferation of PON technology in China. On a year-over-year basis, combined revenue from set-top box and broadband modems were up double-digit percentages, while broadband modems actually grew sequentially versus the typical seasonal decline in Q1.
Looking forward, we see growth drivers including emerging markets, new media server architectures and new technologies such as UltraHD and HEVC. UltraHD and HEVC are still in the early adoption phase and are expected to drive growth for many years to come.
Finally, our emerging businesses of home networking and small cells are expected to be solid growth drivers as well. We're excited about the recent announcement that Cisco will be partnering up with SpiderCloud to deliver Broadcom-based small cell solutions.
Looking at Q2, we expect our Broadband and Connectivity business to be flat to up slightly sequential.
Moving to infrastructure. Revenue in our Infrastructure & Networking group came in as expected at $631 million, up 6% year-over-year and slightly up sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by our switch and PHY products in the data center and enterprise markets.
On a sequential basis, our enterprise growth was driven by ramps in new product introductions to customers where we expect to gain market share.
Our switching business delivered record revenue and better-than-seasonal growth in the March quarter. We recently started sampling next-generation products in the StrataDNX and StrataXGS families. 
In the StrataDNX family, new products target data center and service provider applications and will help drive transitions from in-house ASICs to merchant solutions.
Broadcom introduced 8 new switch products over the past year to even further expand and strengthen our portfolio. Yesterday, we announced Trident II plus, which is a pin-for-pin compatible upgrade to our Trident II switch chip targeting 10- and 40-gig data center applications that offers lower power and an enhanced feature set. These products are complementary to our Tomahawk solution that targets 25-gig data center applications and which is well on its way towards production shipments later this year.
As we look into Q2, we expect our Infrastructure & Networking business to be up sequentially.
In summary, we saw a strong start to 2015. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS ahead of expectations in the first quarter and see solid trends into Q2. We saw year-on-year profitable growth in both of our reportable segments in the March quarter as Broadband and Connectivity and Infrastructure & Networking delivered operating profit ahead of revenue growth. These results reflect our business objective to deliver top line growth along with operating margin leverage.

And then we're also able to integrate additional things in there. For example, the sensor hub I mentioned, that really does a great job in terms of reducing power and other things in devices. And that's just beginning to ship in some new phones. So I think we've got a great opportunity there.

Certainly, I don't think it would go up any meaningful amount, although, again, it sort of depends on how strong we expect seasonally Q3 to be."

So in terms of Q1 relative to Q4, I would say things came in pretty much as we had expected. We were up roughly $20 million in employee costs minus the reduction of the cellular people that left between Q4 and Q1. So in Q4, we had about 200 people left, principally statutory people. And Q1, we sort of ended with about 15 people. So that knocked out about a couple of $3 million, $4 million. Stock-based compensation was favorable, as you can see from the data down about $6 million, $7 million quarter-on-quarter. And I expect stock-based compensation to be relatively flat going into Q2, pretty flattish for the year. The only wildcard on stock-based competition is we have a 2-year employee stock purchase plan, which comes up in Q4 of this year, which could have some changes to it but not significant. So that's sort of what was going on. It was a pretty strong taped-out quarter. We were up meaningfully in tape-out, so we had some offsets in Q1 from NRE which we are anticipating. But again, rolling into Q2, I expect you'll see that number come down. And probably the best way to look at it is the page that we provide in the Q or the tables we provide in the Q and look at the design development costs. They look relatively flat, but again, underneath that is pretty big tape-outs in 1 quarter, offset by some NRE, going into Q2 probably with a fair bit less on the tape-out side because, again, it's lumpy based on sort of the timing when these programs get done."

And I think it's sustainable again because a lot of the partners we work with on connectivity who have their own basebands are actually gaining share versus some of the baseband guys who we don't partner with, so an opportunity to gain share there. We did highlight that there was about $100 million worth of business that was direct attached to our baseband and that, that would depend on who won that business. It turns out most of the people who won that business were partners with us on connectivity. So instead of selling the connectivity with our own baseband, we now sell that same connectivity with a partner's baseband.

And we've seen different strengths from each of those segments. We're roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in each of those. And so it's given us an opportunity there. But the new products that we're announcing today, I think for us or for our competitors or anyone else, it basically takes about a year from when you have your product in hand until the customer can ship in revenue. And then it takes a while for the revenue to ramp. And then it persists over a long period of time if you have a good chip. They don't need to replace it. They run with it for a while. And you're right, that Analyst Day slide, I think, is a really good example of that. What you're seeing is both a combination of strength in the market and all the chips, like Trident, the original Trident, the original Dune chips and other things, are really hitting their stride now in the middle of those periods. So that gives us the strength now. And we're now putting the design wins in place with an even a broader set of products, which includes Tomahawk and the new DNX products and other things that really allow us to do that. And so that's what enables us to get record switch revenue that we saw in the quarter and above seasonal growth just with a combination of breadth of product portfolio now and several years back, all adding up and giving us the strength there. And it's a very good leading indicator for the next 5 years in that business. It should be very strong for us. In terms of M&A, we certainly look for opportunities. Broadcom's sweet spot on M&A is we look to buy small or medium-sized near revenue or early-stage revenue companies. That's our sweet spot. And we look for those. When we find good ones, we buy them. We always look at other opportunities. But we haven't been as successful buying some larger things recently, that hasn't worked out as well for us. So we're probably a little more cautious on that than we've been in the past. But certainly, to the extent we find opportunities we think really create shareholder value, we'll look at those and execute if they make sense."

The combination of that, plus a really rich product family where they can mix and match between all different kinds of combo and discrete products, adding things like sensor hub, actually does make things more sticky because, for example, the sensor hub is a perfect combination with GPS. And to give you an example of why that makes sense is if you think about a GPS in your phone, it has to use a fairly significant amount of power to go get a fix on the satellites and determine a location. And one of the things we can do by integrating the sensor hubs is we can integrate the data from all the accelerometers in the phone and conclude that you're sitting on your chair, you probably haven't moved more than 5 feet and so you probably don't need to do a new GPS fix. And so by eliminating the need to do those location calculations and not having to wake up the main baseband processor, that really saves a lot of power in the phone and it's clear win. So that allows you to, for example, combine a sensor hub with a GPS into a very effective solution, even though it's not immediately obvious that those will go well together. They do actually go very well together in terms of a better solution for the customers. So yes, I would say our high-end business is as strong as ever. Eric, do you want to..."

Things like processors or big switches or fabric chips are very large chips. They are very performance-sensitive, and they're not as price-sensitive. And so those are chips that are perfect to go to newer, smaller nodes as quickly as we can. And so you should expect it will move our switch chips and other process-intensive switch -- intensive devices to smaller nodes fairly quickly. On the other hand, there are products that are either extremely cost-sensitive or simply just don't get the benefit of the nodes. It's like connectivity, for example, does not benefit by moving to 60-nanometer right now because the cost equation makes that unattractive. So we believe, as Henry said, the 28-nanometer will be a very long-lived node for us. They'll be products -- we'll probably still be doing products a few years from now on that node.

And if you don't need the performance improvement or require the shrink to get better yields on your chip or something, you'll probably stay a little further back in the nodes, which I guess is good for the foundry folks because they can run their fabs longer and the depreciation equation is probably a little better for them if they can run the nodes longer. So a silver lining for our foundry partner."

Now there's lumpiness in the other segments, too, but definitely, it depends. If one of our large massive data center customers is doing a huge build-out of new servers, that tends to give us a surge of orders. So it does tend to be -- there's about 10 customers who build really big data centers, and so their timing can often affect that. It makes it hard to predict. I don't think it changes the longer-term growth view of that business, but it makes it harder to predict quarter-by-quarter. Your question on the sensor hubs, I'd say we're in the early days on that, probably first inning on that and a great opportunity to go. And obviously, we'll hurry the game along and try to get a lot of runs in on that one. But I think it's a pretty attractive product, and again, you get a lot of savings there. And I think you'll see us expand that concept and look for other ways to broaden it there. There was a question earlier about what inning are we in, in 2x2, and so I think we're roughly in the third inning on that. So a great opportunity there."

So again, really tuning those products to the specific segments. On the connectivity business in China, I'd say we're doing pretty well there. A lot of the indigenous Chinese customers are increasingly using our products in their high-end phones. And you used to think of phones in China mostly as low or mid range. But if you look at the products coming out of Xiaomi or out of Huawei or Lenovo, I mean, a lot of those guys have decided they want to focus more on the high-end market, and they're doing great products. And so actually, we've seen an increased opportunity in all those customers because as they look to build higher-end products or they look to also support the export market outside of China, they really want the better specs that they get from our products and the better carrier acceptance. And so that's been a very positive trend for us in China, especially at the high end."
