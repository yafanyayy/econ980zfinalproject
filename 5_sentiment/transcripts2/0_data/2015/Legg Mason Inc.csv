As always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and welcome you to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call.We are pleased to announce another quarter of financial and strategic momentum. As we enter t",1895,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and welcome you to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call.
We are pleased to announce another quarter of financial and strategic momentum. As we enter this new calendar year, we intend to build on our progress and capitalize on the investment performance by our affiliates, which remained strong on a broad set of strategies and products. We enjoy a diverse lineup of high-performing investment offerings to address a global marketplace that's well characterized by dramatic differences across many economies, are nevertheless very interconnected and share similar investment challenges. Global events impacting investors range from a very turbulent geopolitical environment to volatility in the currency and energy markets, and certainly, persistently low interest rates, which have created a bit of a desperation for yield across the globe. But it is precisely this volatility that our active managers believes offers significant opportunity for long-term investors to achieve substantial returns. 
This morning, Pete will take you through the quarter from a financial performance standpoint, while I'd like to focus you on what I believe to be the 5 key takeaways for Legg Mason today.
First, and most importantly, the investment performance that we've delivered for clients remain strong overall. 
Second, we've made significant progress in expanding and evolving our product lineup to address the real and changing needs of global investors, though we are still in the very early innings of commercializing the opportunities that we have acquired through QS and Martin Currie. 
Third, we have made substantial progress with respect to the chronic net flow challenges, and we're very pleased to have been in positive long-term net flows for 3 consecutive quarters.
Fourth, we have maintained significant financial strength and flexibility through strategic debt refinancings, while we continue to generate and retain a significant amount of cash. 
And finally, we remain committed to investing in our business where and when we see opportunity, while growing our dividend and remaining committed to share repurchases. These are the 5 key themes that I hope you keep in mind as I walk you through some of the highlights.
Slide 2 presents the highlights for the quarter. Net income was $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Assets under management rose to $709 billion. We achieved $8.8 billion of long-term inflows, driven by nearly $10 billion in fixed income, offset by approximately $1 billion in equity outflows.
Fixed income inflows are particularly notable as the mutual fund industry actually experienced outflows in U.S. taxable fixed income for the quarter. While there is both art and science to the analysis, we believe that approximately 2/3 of our fixed income inflow was impacted by the money in motion underway in this space. That said, and I want to be very clear about this: Even absent the recent manager transition, we have been achieving solid net inflows and gaining market share, in particular, with our unconstrained and absolute return products, which offer the potential for our active managers to deliver value, especially in a more challenging market environment.
We recorded the second consecutive quarter of record global distribution growth and net sales across the entire platform. And as I mentioned earlier, our investment performance remains strong broadly, with 75% or more of strategy AUM exceeding benchmarks for all relevant time periods.
We ended the quarter with an aggregate $8.7 billion in unfunded wins, up from $6.3 billion at the end of September. We closed the acquisition of Martin Currie and the sale of LMIC during the quarter and we repurchased 1.6 million shares year.
And finally, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we intend to deploy once we exhaust our current authorization.
Slide 3 is a very important slide. It shows AUM by affiliate in order of their earnings contribution to Legg Mason, and assets under management by asset class, by client type and by geography. This slide reinforces the increasing diversification of our business, a fact that I believe continues to be underappreciated. 
We see significant opportunity in our retail business, not only with our existing strategies and legacy affiliates, but as we bring Martin Currie's strategies into retail structures and implement sales campaigns around new products launched with QS investors. As I said earlier, these are initiatives that will take time, but they are part of a broader plan that will position Legg Mason for sustained and dependable growth going forward. I am quite pleased with the progress we've made in integrating those firms into Legg Mason, and we are solidly on track with bringing QS and Martin Currie to the global retail marketplace.
Slide 4 provides a snapshot of each of our core affiliates. Brandywine Global had $2.3 billion in total inflows, led by $1.6 billion in fixed income and $700 million in equities. Brandywine's pipeline remains strong at $2.1 billion. And for the second time in 3 years, Steve Smith, David Hoffman, and Jack Macentire, were nominated for the 2014 Morningstar U.S. Fixed Income Fund Manager of the Year for the Legg Mason Brandywine Global opportunities funds. Brandywine also won 2 awards from Asia Asset Management magazine, further recognition of their continued strong investment performance in global bond portfolios. 
ClearBridge Investments had $2.7 billion in inflows, its eighth straight quarter of positive net flows. This is a very, very strong showing, contrasting with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry, which has been in outflows since March of 2014. Unfunded wins at Clearbridge stand at $700 million. And while we are pleased that Clearbridge has a category killer product and Aggressive Growth, their institutional wins and pipeline reflect investor interest in a broader set of strategies, including international value and large-cap growth. Those products as well as the Clearbridge tactical dividend and income products are also beginning to see good interest from our retail client base.
Martin Currie had $400 million outflows for the quarter, a portion of which we have previously disclosed as related to the transaction. Martin Currie closed the quarter with $1.1 billion in unfunded wins. The integration of Martin Currie with Legg Mason Australia has been completed and the firm has now been rebranded Martin Currie Australia. We have signed distribution agreements, enabling our global distribution teams to sell existing Martin Currie funds in the U.K, Europe, Asia and Latin America. And as I've said, we are in the process of bringing the remaining products to the global retail marketplace.
Permal had $20 million outflows for the quarter. The transition underway at Permal from the European high net worth sector to the institutional channel continues, and we are working with them to expand their presence in both the U.S. and international retail markets through the launch of liquid alternatives products.
QS Investors experienced $1.2 billion in outflows for the quarter, with $200 million in unfunded wins. The outflows at QS reflect a combination of a few deal-related outflows as well as a single large outflow from a client, whose asset allocation team made a move to passive. At the same time, I'm especially pleased that QS is experiencing momentum in global distribution, particularly with a number of platform wins in the insurance and sub-advisory channels, where we are well positioned to capture flows over time. 
Royce & Associates saw $2.5 billion in outflows during the quarter. As I've said before, we expect this trend to persist for some time as it will take time for their investment performance to recover. We remain very supportive of the work underway at Royce with respect to both investment performance and strengthening their organization for future growth.
And finally, Western Asset Management, with $8.2 billion in long-term inflows, $10.6 billion and liquidity outflows and $4.5 billion in unfunded wins. Western enjoyed strong flows in broad market portfolios, aided by the money in motion phenomena that we've highlighted as well as continued growth in their high-performing unconstrained strategies.
We continue to believe that money in motion in the institutional market is a long-term story extending out 2 [ph] years or more. We are extremely proud that Ken Leech, Karl Eisenstadt and Mark Lindbloom were named Morningstar's U.S. Fixed Income Fund Managers of the Year for the core and core plus funds, and we believe this is well-deserved acknowledgment that will only help grow our business with our retail and intermediary clients.
Now let me take a moment to step back and address fixed income more broadly, and Slide 5 underscores the opportunity before us. As you can see, we have very strong investment performance and capabilities across the fixed income spectrum, and I want to reiterate some of the points that I made on the last earnings call. 
First, this is no time to be passive with respect to fixed income investing. Different investors, depending on their individual objectives, need a variety of fixed income capabilities that perform well in an increasingly complex and volatile macro environment. This has never been more true than today, with extraordinarily low interest rates, volatile currency markets and the changing landscape and sovereign and corporate credit quality. When unconstrained, proven managers in fixed income can modify duration and diversify or otherwise hedge various exposures to avoid the impact that slavishly following a benchmark can have. We have confidence in the capabilities, the resources and the expertise of our fixed income managers as well as a track record of investment performance to capitalize for investors on just such opportunities. 
Now let's look at Slide 6 and talk about our global retail distribution platform. We enjoyed another very strong quarter in global distribution, with the highest levels of growth and net sales in its history. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of positive net sales for the platform, with positive sales in both the U.S. and internationally over that same timeframe. Looking specifically at fixed income, global sales in the taxable fixed income were $13 billion for the quarter, with $6 billion in net sales across mutual funds, retail SMAs and insurance and sub-advise mandates. 
While we believe the opportunity in fixed income is substantial and ongoing, we also achieved positive net sales within global distribution for all of our affiliates, with the exception of Royce. The quarterly redemption rate for our retail platform was 26%, with the quarterly increase driven primarily by 1 sub-advisory mandate redemption in Japan related to interest rates and currencies, and to a lesser degree, an uptick in outflows at Royce. The U.S. redemption rate remained at 20%, well below industry levels.
I'm very pleased that increasingly, our product development efforts reflect collaborative efforts with our global distribution partners. Specifically during the quarter, we enhanced and repositioned products with QS Investors, including the new 401(k) roadmap CIT funds and an innovative retirement solution launched with LPL Financial. Additionally, we launched the Permal alternative select variable insurance trust with MetLife's investment-only variable annuity. It's the collaborative product development and launches such as these that suggest strong long-term growth opportunities in those channels.
And finally, Slide 7 depicts our overall investment performance, which broadly remains strong. 75% or more of our strategy AUM beat benchmarks across all relevant time periods, and 60% or more of our long-term U.S. fund assets beat the Lipper category average over all-time periods. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Pete. Pete?"
180481,282227747,752226,"Legg Mason Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe.

During the quarter, we incurred our remaining QS-",1596,"Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 8, I'll start with the financial highlights. As Joe noted, we delivered another solid quarter of operating earnings, with net income of $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. During the quarter, we incurred our remaining QS-related integration cost, Martin Currie and LMIC deal-related costs as well as an incremental $3 million of investments in global distribution.
In addition, with the second consecutive quarter of record gross and net sales from our global distribution platform, we saw an increase in sales commission expense. Our revenues increased primarily due to higher performance these as well as the addition of Martin Currie's revenues beginning on October 1st. This was partially offset by the loss of LMIC revenues after their sale on November 7th.
QS integration costs totaled $12.8 million this quarter, while cost related to the Martin Currie acquisition and the sale of LMIC totaled $5.7 million. These were partially offset by a $1.9 million gain on the sale of LMIC, which is included in nonoperating income. Looking forward, we do not anticipate any additional QS integration costs, but we are expecting a further $2.5 million in run rate spending related to our ongoing investments in global distribution. This will bring the run rate cost of these investments in our fiscal fourth quarter and beyond to $7 million to $8 million. 
Adjusted income was $113 million for the quarter or $0.98 per share, which included the impact of QS integration and other M&A-related cost. Average long-term AUM was up 1% from the prior quarter, with average equity up 3% and fixed income basically flat.
This quarter's total performance fees of $29 million were primarily from Brandywine Permal and Western. This quarter's better than forecast performance fees came from Brandywine, where strong performance led to higher than expected performance fee levels. While impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. 
On the capital front, this quarter, we repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares. And as Joe mentioned earlier, the Board approved an additional $1 billion repurchase authorization. We intend to deploy this new authorization after our current one is completed, and at our $90 [ph] million historical pace, as always, subject to markets and/or investments and growth opportunities. 
Moving on to Slide 9, the only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 32%, which largely reflects the successful completion of prior year's audits, which resulted in the release of tax reserves that increased our earnings per share by $0.03 this quarter. That said, we still expect our effective GAAP tax rate for the full fiscal year to be 35% to 37%. And as we've consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter and for the fiscal year, we expect the cash tax rate in the 6% range as you can see on Page 20 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 10. Our assets under management were up slightly compared to the prior quarter, driven by long-term inflows of $8.8 billion as well as $3.1 billion favorable market impact, and despite $6.4 billion of unfavorable FX impact. AUM related to our acquisition of Martin Currie was offset by the AUM related to the sale of LMIC. 
Also at the bottom of this slide, we note our $116 billion of assets under advisement or AUA, which includes assets across most of our key affiliates. But as a reminder, these are generally very low fee mandates and can occasionally move in a fairly lumpy fashion. So in that spirit, I also want to point out that we're expecting our AUA to decline in February by approximately $80 billion. This is primarily due to a QS client deciding to take this service in-house. Although QS continues to have a very good and sizable AUM relationship with this client, due to its very low fee nature, the annualized impact of this loss is only roughly $0.02 per diluted share.
Long-term flows on Slide 11 were positive $8.8 billion and represent our third quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $9.9 billion reflected continued strong performance, combined with high market demand across a variety of our strategies and products. and both our fixed income affiliates, benefited from the money in motion that continues to be underway in fixed income.
Equity flows turned negative, with small cap being our most challenged area, while U.S. large-cap and income-oriented products continue turning in strong performance. 
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's lower rate, primarily reflecting the decline in average AUM at Royce. 
Now I'd like a step back for a minute and talk about how this connects to our revenues. Since we've noted over the last few quarters, when you look at net revenues, which is operating revenues less DNS expenses, we seem to be right in line with external estimates. But external expectations around gross operating revenues have continued to run a bit high. On a go-forward basis, using the current quarter's advisory fee rate is a good starting point. With DNS expenses as a percentage of operating revenues typically running between 21% and 22% after excluding performance fees, which will be a good proxy for that line item. So bottom line, we're just trying to get external estimates to our top line more in line with how we see our actual experience. 
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased by $26 million or 5% to $600 million. I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items, DNS expense decreased as last quarter's expense included the impact of the Western closed-end fund launch. Occupancy expense increased $11 million, primarily related to the QS integration lease charge as well as from the impact of a prior quarter's lease reserve credit.
Communications and technology expenses increased $3 million due to Martin Currie expenses and the continued investment in global distribution. Other expenses increased $4 million due to Martin Currie, offset by the loss of a personal quarter of LMIC and also reflecting additional investments in global distribution.
Turning to Slide 14. Company benefits increased by $16 million. The increase was primarily due to higher performance fees and higher global distribution sales commissions. The addition of Martin Currie's expenses were partially offset by the reduction from LMIC. Transition cost and severance were also up due to the LMIC sale, while mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed also increased quarter-over-quarter. Compensation and benefits ratio, excluding the LMIC charges and the mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investment, came in at 54%, consistent with our outlook for 53% to 54% ratio going forward. Next quarter's ration will likely be a bit higher due to seasonal compensation cost. 
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which decreased to 21.4% from last quarter's 23.8%. The lower margin was primarily due to the increase in QS integration costs as well as the cost related to M&A activity in the quarter. This quarter's operating margin was reduced by 3.3% as a result of those costs, while the prior quarter's operating margin was similarly reduced by 2%. We would expect the operating margin as adjusted to increase next quarter due to the absence of integration cost and M&A activity, but that increase will be partially offset by the increase in seasonal compensation cost, the incremental investments in global distribution as well as lower estimated performance fees.
Slide 16 is a roll forward from fiscal Q2's GAAP earnings per share of $0.04 to this quarter's $0.67 per share. Fiscal Q2 included the debt refinancing and QS Investors' integration as well as other corporate initiative costs of approximately $119 million, which combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.65. 
In fiscal Q3, increases in operating income as well as the impact of share repurchases increased earnings per share by a penny. Mark-to-market on seed investments were positive this quarter compared with negative marks last quarter, and together, with lower interest expense resulting from our refinancing of fiscal Q2, these collectively increased EPS by $0.03. 
And finally, a combination of QS integration, the net cost of the LMIC disposition, Martin Currie acquisition cost, all partially offset by a reduction in tax reserves, reduced earnings by a net $0.06 per share.
I'll wrap up on Slide 17, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 50 million shares or 31% since March of 2010. In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over that same timeframe. We now have 5 straight years of increased annual dividends, representing over a fourfold increase since 2010. On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which stands at $665 million as of December 31, up slightly from September despite the acquisition of Martin Currie in fiscal Q3.
Finally on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $374 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. 
In summary, this was a solid quarter for Legg Mason. And as always, we have complemented our growth with a capital deployment strategy that highlights consistent dividends and share repurchases along with significant investments in growth initiatives, both organically and through acquisitions. So thanks for your time and your interest in Legg Mason. And I will turn it back to Joe."

We are excited about the expanded set of capabilities that we've acquired in QS and Martin Currie. There remains a significant opportunity within fixed income for active global managers, and with our deep expertise, scale, a strong breadth of products and compelling investment performance, we are well positioned to gain market share and grow. We also enjoy broad capabilities and strong investment performance across many of our equity products, and see opportunities to continue to win in active equities across the globe.
As I said upfront, even as we continue to invest in organic growth and M&A, we will continue to actively return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We've mentioned LPL, we got on Prudential, Transamerica, Lincoln National, MPH. We are making great progress and there's a good uptake. We also have positive net flows in our retail distribution platform for QS. So I'm not particularly concerned or any more concerned about the passive threat to QS than I am about anyone else.

And as we've said in the past, there's a number of kind of key factors that are moving around in our margin all the time, and we refer to it as mix that matter. So there is really 4 [ph] of the key mixed things, which affiliates is the revenue and growth coming from what asset classes, what client types and what geographies, because they all have different impacts in our margins. So none of them move in the same direction. They all move, but rarely do they ever move in the same direction. Well, we also had some, I think, key factors in this quarter, most of which are going to turn around and be positive going forward. But the first is just our continued investment in LMGD. and as we've talked about, we see great opportunity from expanding our coverage and doing some additional things on the technology side there. We've made investments in the past, really going back to when Joe was running at a couple of years ago. And those have taken a bit of time to pay off, but that's what you're seeing pay off now in higher sales, and we're very confident that we're going to get higher sales, net sales, from the investments we're making today. The other thing we're seeing is because of the record sales -- keep in mind, we have a lot of front-end loaded cost in our sales commission structure whenever we sell products to the retail channel. So we had a couple of million dollars of incremental commissions this quarter because of record sales, so that's a good thing, particularly given the fact that we'll have those assets for 4 to 5 years and no additional commission coming from that. And then a couple of other factors, the swap of Martin Currie coming in at a lower margin than LMIC. But we have the ability and are seeing it to grow Martin Currie that we didn't have with LMIC, so a much stronger platform. And then minor impact from FX, we're pretty well naturally hedged there, but not perfectly. I know that's 1 -- that's been on people's minds in terms of currency impact, had a slight impact on us, not that much. So bottom line, we're very confident we can improve the margin from here by controlling costs. And as you can see, we've been doing that consistently over the last 2 to 3 years. But more importantly, growing revenues. And the product gaps that we filled already with these acquisitions, the next generation products that Tom Hoops and his team are pumping out, and the payback that we are already seeing from prior year investments in LMGD, we're very confident and bullish on the payback opportunity from these current investments."

When we acquired Permal in 2005, December of 2005, that business was almost exclusively a European high net worth business. And going through the crisis and following the crisis, for Permal and really for the industry, that business has been in decline, and frankly, in attrition. And I would argue that Permal has really done a remarkable job in transforming their business from what was just over 0% -- I've kind of made the comment, but I think they had 1 institutional client when we acquired them and after the acquisition we had 0. Today, that business is roughly 70% institutional. Now when I talk about it transitioning in that European high net worth business, in attrition, I think that is a broad industry trend. But it doesn't mean that there's not opportunities on the retail side. And what we're doing with Permal, we have launched in the U.S. a liquid alternatives strategy that we're excited about. I think I mentioned the launch of a product in the MetLife system this past quarter. We have launched other kind of liquid alternative type products in the U.S. and we're close, I think in the next quarter, this quarter or next, should have a usage vehicle for Permal to be able to address the retail space in Europe and other places. So again, they've really transitioned their business dramatically from basically an entirely retail business to an institutional business, but there is opportunity in the retail side that we think we can capture over time."

We are seeing some business there and we expect to see some additional business there. But as I mentioned in my comments, evaluating how much of our flows are related to money in motion versus what were good, strong underlying core growth transfer, both Western and Brandywine, it's a bit of an art and science. What we saw, and the way we sort of experienced, it was we saw immediate moves in the retail space as you would imagine. A number of people moving in with, whether it be in mutual funds, whether it be in SMAs, where we have a very strong presence. I think we're the second-largest provider of SMAs in the industry. We saw a great pickup in SMAs. We very strong pickup in a mutual fund market share over the last 3 months. So that was sort of the immediate uptake. We did see in the insurance sub-advise and some DCIO mandates come in fairly quickly, where they were able to pull the trigger faster in this spaces. We did see some uptake there. I would say that the institutional business that we -- that kind of the traditional consultant-driven institutional business just takes time, and we do believe this is a plus, minus 2-year type of phenomena because you're dealing with consultants. You're dealing with investment committees. You're dealing with Boards that have to go through a much longer process. We think that will be kind of lumpy. We think it will be kind -- it'll ebb and flow a little bit overtime. We are pleased for -- Western, in particular, has seen significant improvement in their consultant rankings and their opportunities based on consultant, so that gives us a good feel about the opportunities before us from that standpoint. So we feel good. One of the things I will tell you is that -- that I think is interesting, and again, this reinforces the underlying momentum of our fixed income business away from the money in motion phenomena. And that is that, from our unfunded wins on a forward-looking basis, from December 31st on, only a very, very small amount of that is actually related to the money in motion. And so the vast majority of that is really the underlying core strength of our fixed income business that we would have seen in any respect."

And so it's always on us as an active manager to prove our worth and to actually deliver alpha in excess of the fees that we charge. So we get that, we understand that. As it relates to our international platform, what we've said for a long time up until our recent acquisition of Martin Currie was that, really, we were working on global fixed income capabilities and global fixed income products, and that we only had U.S. equity capabilities for the most part to be able to offer to the retail investor. Our global fixed income capability, where we're seeing the uptake there, is not really in core and core plus or broad market strategies, but we're seeing a significant ramp in the absolute return and unconstrained strategies. There's a great uptake there as well as the global opportunistic strategies that Brandywine has. So it's a very, very significant part of our business globally, and we see our market share has grown dramatically in U.S. equities and active U.S. equities internationally. And we see overtime, our ability to grow our non-U.S. equity space with the addition of Martin Currie and as well as a few select non-U.S. equity strategies that Clearbridge, for example, or Brandywine."

And what you've seen on that, on the graph where we plotted out the advisory fee rate, is a very, very tiny changes, because they're kind of just 5 digits right at the decimal point. But we're not oblivious to the trend, and I like the way you framed it and spoke the near term and then the longer term, or intermediate to longer term. Because right now, what's driving that -- the majority of that is really driven by mix from our 2 highest fee affiliates: Royce, which is higher fee equity and retail assets; and obviously, they're in some outflows, and we expect those to last for a bit. But also, Permal has been a negative contributor. But that's kind of a good news, bad news story. The bad news side, as Joe said, high net worth is kind of moving away from the space, but institutional is coming in, and institutional tends be a bifurcation of fees, so it's still a higher fee than our average products and other areas. But it's lower than what the high net worth guys are paying. Flip side of that is, that also comes with performance fee opportunities, and those really haven't kicked in. So we're modestly bullish around that impact, kind of mitigating itself going forward. But so, these are kind of the negatives. But there's a number of positives that are working through the system, and we're seeing real value from those today. It just hasn't quite yet offset the negative impacts to the other ones. And those include the fact that we're seeing very positive flows out of Clearbridge and Brandywine on their equity products. Secondly, we're doing a number of proactive things that are going to help to address this. Obviously, you've seen the affiliate acquisitions, both Martin Currie, in particular. But even QS that have higher fee products in the blended rate. All of the next-generation products that Tom Hoops and his team are working on and pumping out are generally at higher fee, including 2 liquid-all products that we've just launch in Permal. We're looking at launching a third that will go to the retail space. And then probably most importantly is the strong trend from LMGD, Legg Mason Global Distribution, both in the U.S. but even more importantly, internationally. So those assets also come here. So I'd say there's a chance this thing might get some more, but we're dealing with 1, 1 thousandths of a percent, now it's dipping before it turns out. But we're pretty confident as we look forward in our projections as that starts climbing towards the middle of this calendar year."

We're very close to being completed with the hiring of those resources of those people. I think we're about 90% done with the hiring associated with that. And so ultimately, we would say our client-facing activity will be up 50%. That's only a good thing. And I would say that what is of particular benefit to us today, even versus a few years ago when we were making investments, is the momentum at Legg Mason, the number of products, as I mentioned earlier, that are relevant and that are high-performing kind of give you a chance to ramp that a little bit more quickly. Now the other thing, in addition to investing people or investing in technology and training. And technology and training is an opportunity to accelerate and leverage our existing salesforce. So it's not all about kind of investing in the future, but as we get that -- as our technology investment takes hold, and as our training, which is already underway, investment takes hold, our existing salesforce can be more productive and more effective.

So we do see that happening and that we are experience some of that, but we think that that's a longer-term trend as well. As it relates to sort of the past, even in that whole question, whether it be retail or institutional. And I said this in my prepared remarks, we feel just very strongly that there is a role for both, right? We do believe that there is a role for both. But particularly right now in fixed income, it feels like about the worst time to be passive in your investing because it doesn't allow for you to try to negate or hedge in some way or otherwise object to the requirements and the lack of flexibility that you have when you're benchmark investing. So quite frankly, I think increasingly, with rates where they are, and where the -- there is a general consensus. Rates are going to move higher at some point, whether it's shorter term, longer term, they're going to move higher. There's obviously a lot of currency impact in the markets, there's a lot of credit, both corporate credit and sovereign risk issues out there. And just simply passively investing exposes you in a way and exposes clients in a way that we think is a mistake, and increasingly, our clients are listening to that and hearing that. So we think the opportunity for active management broadly speaking is important. We have to demonstrate it and prove it, nowhere more so than in fixed income right now."

We've been watching the dollar strengthened against the yen, the euro, the. pound, pretty much the w hole year. And the total impact for us is probably about a penny or a bit more than that in terms of earnings per share. So pretty much naturally hedged to our expense pool and P&L overseas. And part of that is we get a lot more dollar investment from overseas, but they come in, in U.S. dollar in many cases. The other thing I would add is on oil because we've got several exposures there, both on the equity and fixed income side. And equity we're about 6% across all of our portfolios. That compares to broad market indices, which we'd say, energy would be an 8% weighting. So overall, we're under market exposed to start with, but about half of our exposure is Clearbridge and their MLP vehicles, mostly are focused on midstream, so transportation pipelines in particular. They tend not to move directly. Their earnings still move with the price of oil, and they will benefit from longer term. If oil stays down for longer, there will be more demand for transportation. So we're not too worried about the MLPs. When you take those out, we're less than 4% exposed on the equity side. So half of market exposure in energy. And pretty much a similar story in fixed income. Less than 3% of our fixed income portfolio's exposed to energy. There isn't really a broad market index where we can look at a number of different ones. We look at all of them total we see the market in fixed income be ming like 5% to 6%. So again, we're less than half in both of the spaces. Is that helpful?"

As always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and welcome you to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call.We are pleased to announce another quarter of financial and strategic momentum. As we enter t",1893,"Thank you, Alan. And good morning, everyone. As always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and welcome you to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call.
We are pleased to announce another quarter of financial and strategic momentum. As we enter this new calendar year, we intend to build on our progress and capitalize on the investment performance by our affiliates, which remained strong on a broad set of strategies and products. We enjoy a diversed lineup of high-performing investment offerings to address a global marketplace that, while characterized by dramatic differences across many economies, are nevertheless very interconnected and share similar investment challenges. Global events impacting investors range from a very turbulent geopolitical environment, to volatility in the currency and energy markets and certainly persistently low interest rates, which have created a bit of a desperation for yield across the globe. But it is precisely this volatility that our active managers believes offers significant opportunity for long-term investors to achieve substantial returns.
This morning, Pete will take you through the quarter from a financial performance standpoint, while I'd like to focus you on what I believe to be the 5 key takeaways for Legg Mason today.
First and most importantly, the investment performance that we've delivered for clients remained strong overall. Second, we've made significant progress in expanding and evolving our product lineup to address the real and changing needs of global investors, though we are still in the very early innings of commercializing the opportunities that we have acquired through QS and Martin Currie.
Third, we have made substantial progress with respect to chronic net flow challenges. And we're very pleased to have been in positive long-term net flows for 3 consecutive quarters. Fourth, we have maintained significant financial strength and flexibility through strategic debt refinancings while we continue to generate and retain a significant amount of cash.
And finally, we remain committed to investing in our business where and when we see opportunity while growing our dividend and remaining committed to share repurchases.
These are the 5 key themes that I hope you keep in mind as I walk you through some of the highlights.
Slide 2 presents the highlights for the quarter. Net income was $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Assets Under Management rose to $709 billion. We achieved $8.8 billion of long-term inflows driven by nearly $10 billion in fixed income, offset by approximately $1 billion in equity outflows.
Fixed income inflows are particularly notable, as the mutual fund industry actually experienced outflows in U.S. taxable fixed income for the quarter. While there is both art and science to the analysis, we believe that approximately 2/3 of our fixed income inflow was impacted by the money in motion underway in this space. That said, and I want to be very clear about this, even absent the recent manager transition, we have been achieving solid net inflows and gaining market share, in particular with our unconstrained and absolute return products which offer the potential for our active managers to deliver value, especially in a more challenging market environment.
We recorded the second consecutive quarter of record global distribution gross and net sales across the entire platform. And as I mentioned earlier, our investment performance remained strong broadly, with 75% or more of strategy AUM exceeding benchmarks for all relevant time periods.
We ended the quarter with an aggregate $8.7 billion in unfunded wins, up from $6.3 billion at the end of September. We closed the acquisition of Martin Currie and the sale of LMIC during the quarter. And we repurchased 1.6 million shares. And finally, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we intend to deploy once we exhaust our current authorization.
Slide 3 is a very important slide. It shows AUM by affiliate in order of their earnings contribution to Legg Mason; and Assets Under Management by asset class, by client type and by geography. This slide reinforces the increasing diversification of our business, a fact that I believe continues to be underappreciated.
We see significant opportunity in our retail business not only with our existing strategies and legacy affiliates but as we bring Martin Currie's strategies into retail structures and implement sales campaigns around new products launched with QS investors. And as I said earlier, these are initiatives that will take time, but they are part of a broader plan that will position Legg Mason for sustained and dependable growth going forward. I am quite pleased with the progress we've made in integrating those firms into Legg Mason, and we are solidly on track with bringing QS and Martin Currie to the global retail marketplace.
Slide 4 provides a snapshot of each of our core affiliates. Brandywine Global had $2.3 billion in total inflows, led by $1.6 billion in fixed income and $700 million in equities. Brandywine's pipeline remained strong at $2.1 billion. And for the second time in 3 years, Steve Smith, David Hoffman and Jack McIntyre were nominated for the 2014 Morningstar U.S. Fixed-Income Fund Manager of the Year for the Legg Mason Brandywine Global opportunities funds. Brandywine also won 2 awards from Asia Asset Management magazine, further recognition of their continued strong investment performance in global bond portfolios.
ClearBridge Investments had $2.7 billion in inflows, its eighth straight quarter of positive net flows. This is a very, very strong showing contrasting with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry, which has been in outflows since March of 2014. Unfunded wins at ClearBridge stand at $700 million. And while we are pleased that ClearBridge has a category killer product in Aggressive Growth, their institutional wins and pipeline reflect investor interest in a broader set of strategies, including international value and large-cap growth. Those products, as well as the ClearBridge tactical dividend and income products, are also beginning to see good interest from our retail client base.
Martin Currie had $400 million in outflows for the quarter, a portion of which we have previously disclosed as related to the transaction. Martin Currie closed the quarter with $1.1 billion in unfunded wins. The integration of Martin Currie with Legg Mason Australia has been completed, and the firm has now been rebranded Martin Currie Australia. We have signed distribution agreements enabling our global distribution team to sell existing Martin Currie funds in the U.K, Europe, Asia and Latin America. And as I've said, we are in the process of bringing the remaining products to the global retail marketplace.
Permal had $200 million in outflows for the quarter. The transition underway at Permal from the European high-net-worth sector to the institutional channel continues. And we are working with them to expand their presence in both the U.S. and international retail markets through the launch of liquid alternatives products.
QS Investors experienced $1.2 billion in outflows for the quarter, with $200 million in unfunded wins. The outflows at QS reflect a combination of a few deal-related outflows as well as a single large outflow from a client whose asset allocation team made a move to passive. At the same time, I am especially pleased that QS is experiencing momentum in global distribution, particularly with a number of platform wins in the insurance and sub-advisory channels, where we are well positioned to capture flows over time.
Royce & Associates saw $2.5 billion in outflows during the quarter. As I've said before, we expect this trend to persist for some time, as it will take time for their investment performance to recover. We remain very supportive of the work underway at Royce with respect to both investment performance and strengthening their organization for future growth.
And finally, Western Asset Management, with $8.2 billion in long-term inflows, $10.6 billion in liquidity outflows and $4.5 billion in unfunded wins. Western enjoyed strong flows in broad market portfolios, aided by the money-in-motion phenomena that we've highlighted as well as continued growth in the high-performing unconstrained strategies.
We continue to believe that money in motion in the institutional market is a long-term story extending out 2 years or more. We are extremely proud that Ken Leech, Carl Eichstaedt and Mark Lindbloom were named Morningstar's U.S. Fixed-Income Fund Managers of the Year for the Core and Core Plus funds, and we believe this is well-deserved acknowledgment that will only help grow our business with our retail and intermediary clients.
Now let me take a moment to step back and address fixed income more broadly, and Slide 5 underscores the opportunity before us. As you can see, we have very strong investment performance and capabilities across the fixed income spectrum. And I want to reiterate some of the points that I made on the last earnings call.
First, this is no time to be passive with respect to fixed income investing. Different investors, depending on their individual objectives, need a variety of fixed income capabilities that perform well in an increasingly complex and volatile macro environment. This has never been more true than today with extraordinarily low interest rates, volatile currency markets and the changing landscape in sovereign and corporate credit quality. When unconstrained, proven managers in fixed income can modify duration and diversify or otherwise hedge various exposures to avoid the impact that slavishly following a benchmark can have. We have confidence in the capabilities, the resources and the expertise of our fixed income managers, as well as a track record of investment performance, to capitalize for investors on just such opportunities.
Now let's look at Slide 6 and talk about our global retail distribution platform. We enjoyed another very strong quarter in global distribution, with the highest levels of gross and net sales in its history. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of positive net sales for the platform, with positive sales in both the U.S. and internationally over that same time frame. Looking specifically at fixed income, global sales in the taxable fixed income were $13 billion for the quarter, with $6 billion in net sales across mutual funds, retail SMAs and insurance and sub-advise mandates.
While we believe the opportunity in fixed income is substantial and ongoing, we also achieved positive net sales within global distribution for all of our affiliates, with the exception of Royce. The quarterly redemption rate for our retail platform was 26%, with the quarterly increase driven primarily by one sub-advisory mandate redemption in Japan related to interest rates and currencies; and to a lesser degree, an uptick in outflows at Royce. The U.S. redemption rate remained at 20%, well below industry levels.
I'm very pleased that, increasingly, our product development efforts reflect collaborative efforts with our global distribution partners. Specifically during the quarter, we enhanced and repositioned products with QS Investors, including the new 401(k) road map CIT funds and an innovative retirement solution launched with LPL Financial. Additionally, we launched the Permal alternative select variable insurance trust with MetLife's investment-only variable annuity. It's the collaborative product development and launches such as these that suggest strong long-term growth opportunities in those channels.
And finally, Slide 7 depicts our overall investment performance, which broadly remained strong. 75% or more of our strategy AUM beat benchmarks across all relevant time periods. And 60% or more of our long-term U.S. fund assets beat the Lipper category average over all time periods.
And with that, let me turn it over to Pete. Pete?"
180481,282227747,752588,"Legg Mason Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe.Turning to Slide 8, I'll start with the financial highlights.As Joe noted, we delivered another solid quarter of operating earnings with net income of $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. During the quarter, we incurred our remaining QS",1594,"Thanks, Joe.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll start with the financial highlights.
As Joe noted, we delivered another solid quarter of operating earnings with net income of $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. During the quarter, we incurred our remaining QS-related integration costs, Martin Currie and LMIC deal-related costs as well as an incremental $3 million of investments in global distribution. In addition, with the second consecutive quarter of record gross and net sales from our global distribution platform, we saw an increase in sales commission expense.
Our revenues increased primarily due to higher performance fees as well as the addition of Martin Currie's revenues beginning on October 1st. This was partially offset by the loss of LMIC revenues after their sale on November 7.
QS integration costs totaled $12.8 million this quarter, while costs related to the Martin Currie acquisition and the sale of LMIC totaled $5.7 million. These were partially offset by a $1.9 million gain on the sale of LMIC, which is included in nonoperating income. Looking forward, we do not anticipate any additional QS integration costs, but we are expecting a further $2.5 million in run rate spending related to our ongoing investments in global distribution. This will bring the run rate cost of these investments in our fiscal fourth quarter and beyond to $7 million to $8 million.
Adjusted income was $113 million for the quarter or $0.98 per share, which included the impact of QS integration and other M&A-related costs. Average long-term AUM was up 1% from the prior quarter, with average equity up 3% and fixed income basically flat.
This quarter's total performance fees of $29 million were primarily from Brandywine, Permal and Western. This quarter's better-than-forecast performance fees came from Brandywine, where strong performance led to higher-than-expected performance fee levels. While impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $15 million.
On the capital front, this quarter, we repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares. And as Joe mentioned earlier, the board approved an additional $1 billion repurchase authorization. We intend to deploy this new authorization after our current one is completed and at our $90 million historical pace, as always, subject to markets and/or investments and growth opportunities.
Moving on to Slide 9. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 32%, which largely reflects the successful completion of prior year's audits, which resulted in the release of tax reserves that increased our earnings per share by $0.03 this quarter. That said, we still expect our effective GAAP tax rate for the full fiscal year to be 35% to 37%. And as we've consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter and for the fiscal year, we expect the cash tax rate in the 6% range, as you can see on Page 20 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Assets Under Management were up slightly compared to the prior quarter, driven by long-term inflows of $8.8 billion as well as $3.1 billion of favorable market impact and despite $6.4 billion of unfavorable FX impact. AUM related to our acquisition of Martin Currie was offset by the AUM related to the sale of LMIC.
Also, at the bottom of this slide, we note our $116 billion of Assets Under Advisement or AUA, which includes assets across most of our key affiliates, but as a reminder, these are generally very low-fee mandates and can occasionally move in a fairly lumpy fashion. So in that spirit, I also want to point out that we're expecting our AUA to decline in February by approximately $80 billion. This is primarily due to a QS client deciding to take this service in-house, although QS continues to have a very good and sizable AUM relationship with this client. Due to its very low-fee nature, the annualized impact of this loss is only roughly $0.02 per diluted share.
Long-term flows, on Slide 11, were a positive $8.8 billion and represent our third quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $9.9 billion reflected continued strong performance, combined with high market demand, across a variety of our strategies and products. And both of our fixed income affiliates benefited from the money in motion that continues to be underway in fixed income. Equity flows turned negative, with small cap being our most challenged area, while U.S. large-cap and income-oriented products continued turning in strong performance.
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's lower rate, primarily reflecting the decline in average AUM at Royce.
Now I'd like to step back for a minute and talk about how this connects to our revenues. Since we've noted over the last few quarters, when you look at net revenue, which is operating revenues, less D&S expenses, we seem to be right in line with external estimates. But external expectations around gross operating revenues have continued to run a bit high. On a go-forward basis, using the current quarter's advisory fee rate is a good starting point, with D&S expenses as a percentage of operating revenues typically running between 21% and 22% after excluding performance fees, which will be a good proxy for that line item. So bottomline, we are just trying to get external estimates of our top line more in line with how we see our actual experience.
Operating expenses, on Slide 13, increased by $26 million or 5% to $600 million. I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items: D&S expense decreased, as last quarter's expense included the impact of the Western closed-end fund launch. Occupancy expense increased $11 million, primarily related to the QS integration lease charge as well as from the impact of a prior-quarter lease reserve credit. Communications and technology expenses increased $3 million due to Martin Currie expenses and the continued investment in global distribution. Other expenses increased $4 million due to Martin Currie, offset by the loss of a partial quarter of LMIC and also reflecting additional investments in global distribution.
Turning to Slide 14. Comp and benefits increased by $16 million. The increase was primarily due to higher performance fees and higher global distribution sales commissions. The addition of Martin Currie's expenses were partially offset by the reduction from LMIC. Transition costs and severance were also up due to the LMIC sale, while mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed also increased quarter-over-quarter.
The compensation and benefits ratio, excluding the LMIC charges and the mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, came in at 54%, consistent with our outlook for a 53% to 54% ratio going forward. Next quarter's ratio will likely be a bit higher due to seasonal compensation costs.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which decreased to 21.4% from last quarter's 23.8%. The lower margin was primarily due to the increase in QS integration costs as well as the costs related to M&A activity in the quarter. This quarter's operating margin was reduced by 3.3% as a result of those costs, while the prior quarter's operating margin was similarly reduced by 2%. We would expect the operating margin, as adjusted, to increase next quarter due to the absence of integration costs and M&A activity, but that increase will be partially offset by the increase in seasonal compensation costs, the incremental investments in global distribution as well as lower estimated performance fees.
Slide 16 is a roll forward from fiscal Q2's GAAP earnings per share of $0.04 to this quarter's $0.67 per share. Fiscal Q2 included the debt refinancing and QS Investors' integration as well as other corporate initiative costs of approximately $119 million, which combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.65. In fiscal Q3, increases in operating income, as well as the impact of share repurchases, increased earnings per share by $0.01.
Mark-to-market on seed investments were positive this quarter compared with negative marks last quarter. And together with lower interest expense resulting from our refinancing in fiscal Q2, these collectively increased EPS by $0.03.
And finally, a combination of QS integration, the net cost of the LMIC disposition, Martin Currie acquisition costs, all partially offset by a reduction in tax reserves, reduced earnings by a net $0.06 per share.
I'll wrap up on Slide 17, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 50 million shares or 31% since March of 2010. In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over that same time frame. We now have 5 straight years of increased annual dividends, representing over a fourfold increase since 2010. On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which stands at $665 million as of December 31, up slightly from September despite the acquisition of Martin Currie in fiscal Q3. Finally, on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $374 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class.
In summary, this was a solid quarter for Legg Mason. And as always, we have complemented our growth with a capital deployment strategy that highlights consistent dividends and share repurchases, along with significant investments in growth initiatives both organically and through acquisitions.
So thanks for your time and your interest in Legg Mason. And now I'll turn it back to Joe."

Building momentum and positioning Legg Mason for growth have been our themes for this fiscal year, and I think it's quite clear that we're making good progress on both. Continued growth in global distribution gross and net sales reflect a strong lineup of highly competitive products and strong sales execution. With nearly 90% of the hiring associated with our distribution growth plans complete, we will expand client coverage by approximately 50%, which will be a key driver of future growth and progress.
We are excited about the expanded set of capabilities that we've acquired in QS and Martin Currie. There remains a significant opportunity within fixed income for active global managers. And with our deep expertise, scale, a strong breadth of products and compelling investment performance, we are well positioned to gain market share and grow. We also enjoy broad capabilities and strong investment performance across many of our equity products and see opportunities to continue to win in active equities across the globe.
As I said upfront, even as we continue to invest in organic growth and M&A, we will continue to actively return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
And with that, we are happy to take your questions."

As it relates to the implications of passive to QS, I don't think it's any more or less than any of our affiliates. I think it's all about performance over time. Now in the case of QS, I mean this was not performance related. It was really just a move and an allocation move on the part of a client to passive. But I see actually there are opportunities growing. As I mentioned, we've seen significant uptake from our global distribution platform, particularly with respect to the insurance sub-advise space. We got on 6 different platforms this past quarter. We mentioned LPL. We got on Prudential, Transamerica, Lincoln National, NPH. We are making great progress and there's a good uptake. We also had positive net flows in our retail distribution platform for QS. So I'm not particularly concerned or any more concerned about the passive threat to QS than I am about anyone else. As it relates to Martin Currie, this just takes time, and it's a grinding kind of a thing. We have to get it. We're working to get Martin Currie into the U.S. space, in 40 Act vehicles, as well as use its vehicles, obviously, across the pond. It might be 6 or 9 months, candidly, before we get them in. It just takes time. And we've got to be patient with it, but what I will tell you is we're firing on all cylinders. Our product teams are all over Martin Currie, maybe overwhelming them a little bit but all over them in terms of getting their strategies into vehicles that we can sell in the retail market space."

And as we've said in the past, there's a number of kind of key factors that are moving around in our margin all the time, and we refer to it as mix that matters. So there's really 4 kind of key mix things: which affiliate is the revenue and growth coming from, what asset classes, what client types and what geographies, because they all have different impacts on our margin. So -- and none of them move in the same direction. They all move, but rarely do they ever all move in the same direction. Well, we also had some, I think, key factors in this quarter, most of which are going to turn around and be positive going forward. But the first is just our continued investment in LMGD. And as we've talked about, we're -- we see great opportunity from expanding our coverage and doing some additional things on the technology side there. We've made investments in the past, really going back to when Joe was running it a couple of years ago. And those have taken a bit of time to pay off, but that's what you're seeing pay off now in higher sales. And we're very confident that we're going to get higher sales, net sales, from the investments we're making today. The other thing we're seeing is, because of the record sales, keep in mind, we have a lot of front-end-loaded costs in our sales commission structure whenever we sell product through the retail channel. So we had a couple million dollars of incremental commissions this quarter because of record sales, so that's a good thing, particularly given the fact that we'll have those assets for 4 to 5 years and no additional commission coming from that. And then a couple other factors: the swap of Martin Currie coming in, in a bit of a lower margin than LMIC, but we have the ability and are seeing it to grow Martin Currie that we didn't have with LMIC, so a much stronger platform. And then minor impact from FX. We're pretty well naturally hedged there but not perfectly. I know that's one that's been on people's minds in terms of currency impact, had a slight impact on us, not that much. So bottomline, we're very confident we can improve the margin from here by controlling costs. And as you can see, we've been doing that consistently over the last 2 to 3 years. But more importantly, growing revenues. And the product gaps that we filled already with these acquisitions, the next-generation products that Tom Hoops and his team are pumping out. And then the payback that we're already seeing from prior year investments in LMGD. And we're very confident and bullish on the payback opportunity from these current investments."

And I would argue that Permal has really done a remarkable job in transforming their business from what was just over 0%. I've kind of made the comment that I think they had one institutional client when we acquired them. And after the acquisition, we had 0. Today, that business is roughly 70% institutional. Now when I talk about it transitioning in that European high-net-worth business, in attrition, I think that is a broad industry trend, but it doesn't mean that there's not opportunities on the retail side. And what we're doing with Permal, we have launched in the U.S. a liquid alternatives strategy that we're excited about. I think I mentioned the launch of a product in the MetLife system this past quarter. We have launched other kind of liquid alternatives type products in the U.S. And we're close, I think, in the next quarter -- in this quarter or next, should have a usage vehicle for Permal to be able to address the retail space in Europe and other places. So again, they've really transitioned their business dramatically from basically an entirely retail business to an institutional business, but there is opportunity in the retail side that we think we can capture over time."

What we saw and the way we sort of experienced it was we saw immediate moves in the retail space, as you would imagine, a number of people moving in, whether it be in mutual funds, whether it be in SMAs, where we have a very strong presence. I think we're the second largest provider of SMAs in the industry. We saw a great pickup in SMAs. We saw a very strong pickup in our mutual fund market share over the last 3 months. So that was sort of the immediate uptake. We did see in the insurance sub-advise and some DCIO mandates come in fairly quickly, where they were able to pull the trigger faster in those spaces. We did see some uptake there. I would say that the institutional business that we -- that kind of the traditional consultant-driven institutional business just takes time. And we do believe this is a plus, minus 2-year type of phenomena because you're dealing with consultants. You're dealing with investment committees. You're dealing with boards that have to go through a much longer process. We think that'll be kind of lumpy. We think it'll be kind of -- it'll ebb and flow a little bit over time. We are pleased for -- Western in particular has seen significant improvement in their consultant rankings and their opportunities based on consultants. So that gives us a good feel about the opportunities before us from that standpoint. So we feel good. One of the things I'll tell you is that -- that I think is interesting, and again this reinforces the underlying momentum of our fixed income business away from the money-in-motion phenomena, and that is that, of our  unfunded wins on a forward-looking basis, from December 31 on, only a very, very small amount of that is actually related to the money in motion. And so the vast majority of that is really the underlying core strength of our fixed income business that we will have seen in any respect."

We do acknowledge and recognize that the passive space has got a legitimate place in investors' portfolios.

And so it's always on us as an active manager to prove our worth and to actually deliver alpha in excess of the fees that we charge. So we get that. We understand that. As it relates to our international platform, what we've said for a long time up until our recent acquisition of Martin Currie was that really we were working on global fixed income capabilities and global fixed income products and that we only had U.S. equity capabilities, for the most part, to be able to offer to the retail investor. Our global fixed income capability, where we're seeing the uptake there is not really in Core and Core Plus or broad market strategies, but we're seeing significant -- a significant ramp in the absolute return and unconstrained strategies. There's great uptake there, as well as the global opportunistic strategies that Brandywine has. So it's a very, very significant part of our business globally. And we see our market share has grown dramatically in U.S. equities and active U.S. equities, internationally. And we see, over time, our ability to grow our non-U.S. equity space with the addition of Martin Currie and as well as a few select non-U.S. equity strategies at ClearBridge, for example, or Brandywine."

And what you've seen on that, on the graph where we've plot out the advisory fee rate is some very, very tiny changes because they're kind of 5 digits right at the decimal point. But we're not oblivious to the trend. And I like the way you framed it and spoke the nearer term and the longer term or intermediate to longer term because, right now, what's driving that, the majority of that is really driven by mix from our 2 highest fee affiliates: Royce, which is higher fee equity and retail assets, and obviously they're in some outflows and we expect those to last for a bit; but also, Permal has been a negative contributor. But that's kind of a ""good news, bad news"" story. The bad news side, as Joe said, high net worth is kind of moving away from the space, but institutional is coming in. And the institutional tends be a bifurcation of fees, so it's still a higher fee than our average products in other areas, but it's lower than what the high-net-worth guys are paying. A flip side to that is that it also comes with performance fee opportunities, and those really haven't kicked in. So we're modestly bullish around that impact kind of mitigating itself going forward. But so those are kind of the negatives, but there's a number of positives that are working through the system, and we're seeing real value from those today. It just hasn't quite yet offset the negative impacts, the other ones. And those include the fact that we're seeing very positive flows out of ClearBridge and Brandywine on their equity products. Secondly, we're doing a number of proactive things that are going to help to address this. Obviously, you've seen the affiliate acquisitions, both Martin Currie in particular but even QS, that have higher fee products than the blended rate. All of the next-generation products that Tom Hoops' team are working on and pumping out are generally at higher fee, including 2 liquid-all products that we have just launched with Permal. And we're looking at launching a third that will go to the retail space. And then probably most importantly is the strong trend from LMGD, Legg Mason Global Distribution, both in the U.S. but even more importantly internationally. So those assets also come higher. So I'd say there's a chance this thing might dip some more, but we're dealing with 1/1,000 of a percent now where it's dipping before it turns up. But we're pretty confident as we look forward in our projections that, that starts climbing towards the middle of this calendar year."

We're very close to being completed with the hiring of those resources, of those people, where I think we're about 90% done with the hiring associated with that. And so ultimately, we would say our client-facing activity will be up 50%. That's only a good thing. And I would say that what is of particular benefit to us today, even versus a few years ago when we were making investments, is the momentum at Legg Mason, the number of products, as I mentioned earlier, that are relevant and that are high performing kind of give you a chance to ramp that a little bit more quickly. Now the other thing in addition to investing in people, we're investing in technology and training. And the technology and training is an opportunity to accelerate and leverage our existing sales force. So it's not all about kind of investing in the future, but as we get -- as our technology investment takes hold and as our training, which is already underway, investment takes hold, our existing sales force can be more productive and more effective.

So we do see that happening and that we are experiencing some of that, but we think that that's a longer-term trend as well. As it relates to sort of the passive and that whole question, whether it be retail or institutional, and I said this in my prepared remarks, we feel just very strongly that there's a role for both, right? We do believe that there's a role for both, but particularly right now in fixed income, it feels like about the worst time to be passive in your investing because it doesn't allow for you to try to negate or hedge in some way or otherwise obviate the requirements that -- and the lack of flexibility that you have when you're benchmark investing. So quite frankly, I think, increasingly, as with rates where they are and with the -- there's a general consensus. Rates are going to move higher at some point. Whether it's shorter term, longer term, they are going to move higher. There's obviously a lot of currency impact in the markets. There's a lot of credit, both corporate credit and sovereign risk issues out there. And just simply passively investing exposes you in a way and exposes clients in a way that we think is a mistake, and increasingly, our clients are listening to that and hearing that. So we think the opportunity for active management, broadly speaking, is important. And we have to demonstrate it and prove it nowhere more so than in fixed income right now."

I may also talk about oil as well and energy because that -- it was a question that didn't come up but, I'm sure, is on people's minds. But the FX impact for us is almost de minimis. We've been watching the dollar strengthen against the yen, the euro, the pound pretty much the whole year. And the total impact for us is probably about $0.01 or a little bit more than that in terms of earnings per share. So pretty well naturally hedged between our expense pool and P&L overseas. And again, part of that is we get a lot more dollar investments from overseas, but they come in, in U.S. dollars, in many cases. The other thing I'd add is on oil because we've got several exposures there both on the equity and the fixed income side. And equity, we're about 6% across all of our portfolios. That compares to broad market indices which would say energy would be an 8% weighting. So overall, we're under-market exposed, to start with, but about half of our exposure is ClearBridge, in their MLP vehicles, which mostly are focused on midstream, so transportation pipelines in particular. They tend not to move directly. Their earnings still move with the price of oil and, if anything, will benefit from longer term. If oil stays down for longer, there will be more demand for transportation. So we're not too worried about the MLPs. When you take those out, we're less than 4% exposed in the equity side, so half the -- half of the market exposure in energy. And pretty much a similar story in fixed income, less than 3% of our fixed income portfolio is exposed to energy. There isn't really a broad market index, but you can look at a number of different ones. When we look at all of them in total, we see the market in fixed income being more like 5% to 6%. So again, we're less than half in both of those spaces. Is that helpful? Thank you for the question."

As we enter t",1892,"Thank you, Alan. And good morning, everyone. As always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and welcome you to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call.
We are pleased to announce another quarter of financial and strategic momentum. As we enter this new calendar year, we intend to build on our progress and capitalize on the investment performance by our affiliates, which remained strong on a broad set of strategies and products. We enjoy a diverse lineup of high-performing investment offerings to address a global marketplace that, while characterized by dramatic differences across many economies, are nevertheless very interconnected and share similar investment challenges. Global events impacting investors range from a very turbulent geopolitical environment, to volatility in the currency and energy markets and certainly persistently low interest rates, which have created a bit of a desperation for yield across the globe. But it is precisely this volatility that our active managers believes offers significant opportunity for long-term investors to achieve substantial returns.
This morning, Pete will take you through the quarter from a financial performance standpoint, while I'd like to focus you on what I believe to be the 5 key takeaways for Legg Mason today.
First and most importantly, the investment performance that we've delivered for clients remains strong overall. 
Second, we've made significant progress in expanding and evolving our product lineup to address the real and changing needs of global investors, though we are still in the very early innings of commercializing the opportunities that we have acquired through QS and Martin Currie.
Third, we have made substantial progress with respect to chronic net flow challenges. And we're very pleased to have been in positive long-term net flows for 3 consecutive quarters. 
Fourth, we have maintained significant financial strength and flexibility through strategic debt refinancings while we continue to generate and retain a significant amount of cash.
And finally, we remain committed to investing in our business where and when we see opportunity while growing our dividend and remaining committed to share repurchases.
These are the 5 key themes that I hope you keep in mind as I walk you through some of the highlights.
Slide 2 presents the highlights for the quarter. Net income was $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Assets Under Management rose to $709 billion. We achieved $8.8 billion of long-term inflows driven by nearly $10 billion in fixed income, offset by approximately $1 billion in equity outflows.
Fixed income inflows are particularly notable, as the mutual fund industry actually experienced outflows in U.S. taxable fixed income for the quarter. While there is both art and science to the analysis, we believe that approximately 2/3 of our fixed income inflow was impacted by the money in motion underway in this space. That said, and I want to be very clear about this, even absent the recent manager transition, we have been achieving solid net inflows and gaining market share, in particular with our unconstrained and absolute return products which offer the potential for our active managers to deliver value, especially in a more challenging market environment.
We recorded the second consecutive quarter of record global distribution gross and net sales across the entire platform. And as I mentioned earlier, our investment performance remained strong broadly, with 75% or more of strategy AUM exceeding benchmarks for all relevant time periods.
We ended the quarter with an aggregate $8.7 billion in unfunded wins, up from $6.3 billion at the end of September. We closed the acquisition of Martin Currie and the sale of LMIC during the quarter. And we repurchased 1.6 million shares. And finally, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we intend to deploy once we exhaust our current authorization.
Slide 3 is a very important slide. It shows AUM by affiliate in order of their earnings contribution to Legg Mason; and Assets Under Management by asset class, by client type and by geography. This slide reinforces the increasing diversification of our business, a fact that I believe continues to be underappreciated.
We see significant opportunity in our retail business not only with our existing strategies and legacy affiliates but as we bring Martin Currie's strategies into retail structures and implement sales campaigns around new products launched with QS investors. As I said earlier, these are initiatives that will take time, but they are part of a broader plan that will position Legg Mason for sustained and dependable growth going forward. I am quite pleased with the progress we've made in integrating those firms into Legg Mason, and we are solidly on track with bringing QS and Martin Currie to the global retail marketplace.
Slide 4 provides a snapshot of each of our core affiliates. Brandywine Global had $2.3 billion in total inflows, led by $1.6 billion in fixed income and $700 million in equities. Brandywine's pipeline remained strong at $2.1 billion. And for the second time in 3 years, Steve Smith, David Hoffman and Jack McIntyre were nominated for the 2014 Morningstar U.S. Fixed-Income Fund Manager of the Year for the Legg Mason Brandywine Global opportunities funds. Brandywine also won 2 awards from Asia Asset Management magazine, further recognition of their continued strong investment performance in global bond portfolios.
ClearBridge Investments had $2.7 billion in inflows, its eighth straight quarter of positive net flows. This is a very, very strong showing contrasting with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry, which has been in outflows since March of 2014. Unfunded wins at ClearBridge stand at $700 million. And while we are pleased that ClearBridge has a category killer product in Aggressive Growth, their institutional wins and pipeline reflect investor interest in a broader set of strategies, including international value and large-cap growth. Those products, as well as the ClearBridge tactical dividend and income products, are also beginning to see good interest from our retail client base.
Martin Currie had $400 million in outflows for the quarter, a portion of which we have previously disclosed as related to the transaction. Martin Currie closed the quarter with $1.1 billion in unfunded wins. The integration of Martin Currie with Legg Mason Australia has been completed, and the firm has now been rebranded Martin Currie Australia. We have signed distribution agreements enabling our global distribution team to sell existing Martin Currie funds in the U.K, Europe, Asia and Latin America. And as I've said, we are in the process of bringing the remaining products to the global retail marketplace.
Permal had $200 million in outflows for the quarter. The transition underway at Permal from the European high-net-worth sector to the institutional channel continues. And we are working with them to expand their presence in both the U.S. and international retail markets through the launch of liquid alternatives products.
QS Investors experienced $1.2 billion in outflows for the quarter, with $200 million in unfunded wins. The outflows at QS reflect a combination of a few deal-related outflows as well as a single large outflow from a client whose asset allocation team made a move to passive. At the same time, I am especially pleased that QS is experiencing momentum in global distribution, particularly with a number of platform wins in the insurance and sub-advisory channels, where we are well positioned to capture flows over time.
Royce & Associates saw $2.5 billion in outflows during the quarter. As I've said before, we expect this trend to persist for some time, as it will take time for their investment performance to recover. We remain very supportive of the work underway at Royce with respect to both investment performance and strengthening their organization for future growth.
And finally, Western Asset Management, with $8.2 billion in long-term inflows, $10.6 billion in liquidity outflows and $4.5 billion in unfunded wins. Western enjoyed strong flows in broad market portfolios, aided by the money in motion phenomena that we've highlighted as well as continued growth in their high-performing unconstrained strategies.
We continue to believe that money in motion in the institutional market is a long-term story extending out 2 years or more. We are extremely proud that Ken Leech, Carl Eichstaedt and Mark Lindbloom were named Morningstar's U.S. Fixed-Income Fund Managers of the Year for the Core and Core Plus funds, and we believe this is well-deserved acknowledgment that will only help grow our business with our retail and intermediary clients.
Now let me take a moment to step back and address fixed income more broadly, and Slide 5 underscores the opportunity before us. As you can see, we have very strong investment performance and capabilities across the fixed income spectrum. And I want to reiterate some of the points that I made on the last earnings call.
First, this is no time to be passive with respect to fixed income investing. Different investors, depending on their individual objectives, need a variety of fixed income capabilities that perform well in an increasingly complex and volatile macro environment. This has never been more true than today with extraordinarily low interest rates, volatile currency markets and the changing landscape in sovereign and corporate credit quality. When unconstrained, proven managers in fixed income can modify duration and diversify or otherwise hedge various exposures to avoid the impact that slavishly following a benchmark can have. We have confidence in the capabilities, the resources and the expertise of our fixed income managers, as well as a track record of investment performance, to capitalize for investors on just such opportunities.
Now let's look at Slide 6 and talk about our global retail distribution platform. We enjoyed another very strong quarter in global distribution, with the highest levels of gross and net sales in its history. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of positive net sales for the platform, with positive sales in both the U.S. and internationally over that same time frame. Looking specifically at fixed income, global sales into taxable fixed income were $13 billion for the quarter, with $6 billion in net sales across mutual funds, retail SMAs and insurance and sub-advise mandates.
While we believe the opportunity in fixed income is substantial and ongoing, we also achieved positive net sales within global distribution for all of our affiliates, with the exception of Royce. The quarterly redemption rate for our retail platform was 26%, with the quarterly increase driven primarily by one sub-advisory mandate redemption in Japan related to interest rates and currencies; and to a lesser degree, an uptick in outflows at Royce. The U.S. redemption rate remained at 20%, well below industry levels.
I'm very pleased that, increasingly, our product development efforts reflect collaborative efforts with our global distribution partners. Specifically during the quarter, we enhanced and repositioned products with QS Investors, including the new 401(k) Roadmap CIT funds and an innovative retirement solution launched with LPL Financial. Additionally, we launched the Permal alternative select variable insurance trust with MetLife's investment-only variable annuity. It's the collaborative product development and launches such as these that suggest strong long-term growth opportunities in those channels.
And finally, Slide 7 depicts our overall investment performance, which broadly remains strong. 75% or more of our strategy AUM beat benchmarks across all relevant time periods. And 60% or more of our long-term U.S. fund assets beat the Lipper category average over all time periods.
And with that, let me turn it over to Pete. Pete?"
180481,282227747,752684,"Legg Mason Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe.Turning to Slide 8, I'll start with the financial highlights.As Joe noted, we delivered another solid quarter of operating earnings with net income of $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. During the quarter, we incurred our remaining QS",1594,"Thanks, Joe.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll start with the financial highlights.
As Joe noted, we delivered another solid quarter of operating earnings with net income of $77 million or $0.67 per diluted share. During the quarter, we incurred our remaining QS-related integration costs, Martin Currie and LMIC deal-related costs, as well as an incremental $3 million of investments in global distribution. In addition, with the second consecutive quarter of record gross and net sales from our global distribution platform, we saw an increase in sales commission expense.
Our revenues increased primarily due to higher performance fees as well as the addition of Martin Currie's revenues beginning on October 1st. This was partially offset by the loss of LMIC revenues after their sale on November 7.
QS integration costs totaled $12.8 million this quarter, while costs related to the Martin Currie acquisition and the sale of LMIC totaled $5.7 million. These were partially offset by a $1.9 million gain on the sale of LMIC, which is included in nonoperating income. Looking forward, we do not anticipate any additional QS integration costs, but we are expecting a further $2.5 million in run rate spending related to our ongoing investments in global distribution. This will bring the run rate cost of these investments in our fiscal fourth quarter and beyond to $7 million to $8 million.
Adjusted income was $113 million for the quarter or $0.98 per share, which included the impact of QS integration and other M&A-related costs. Average long-term AUM was up 1% from the prior quarter, with average equity up 3% and fixed income basically flat.
This quarter's total performance fees of $29 million were primarily from Brandywine, Permal and Western. This quarter's better-than-forecast performance fees came from Brandywine, where strong performance led to higher-than-expected performance fee levels. While impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $15 million.
On the capital front, this quarter we repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares. And as Joe mentioned earlier, the board approved an additional $1 billion repurchase authorization. We intend to deploy this new authorization after our current one is completed and at our $90 million historical pace, as always subject to markets and/or investments and growth opportunities.
Moving on to Slide 9. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 32%, which largely reflects the successful completion of prior year's audits, which resulted in the release of tax reserves that increased our earnings per share by $0.03 this quarter. That said, we still expect our effective GAAP tax rate for the full fiscal year to be 35% to 37%. And as we've consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter and for the fiscal year, we expect the cash tax rate in the 6% range, as you can see on Page 20 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Assets Under Management were up slightly compared to the prior quarter, driven by long-term inflows of $8.8 billion as well as $3.1 billion of favorable market impact and despite $6.4 billion of unfavorable FX impact. AUM related to our acquisition of Martin Currie was offset by the AUM related to the sale of LMIC.
Also, at the bottom of this slide, we note our $116 billion of Assets Under Advisement or AUA, which includes assets across most of our key affiliates, but as a reminder, these are generally very low-fee mandates and can occasionally move in a fairly lumpy fashion. So in that spirit, I also want to point out that we're expecting our AUA to decline in February by approximately $80 billion. This is primarily due to a QS client deciding to take this service in-house, although QS continues to have a very good and sizable AUM relationship with this client. Due to its very low-fee nature, the annualized impact of this loss is only roughly $0.02 per diluted share.
Long-term flows, on Slide 11, were a positive $8.8 billion and represent our third quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $9.9 billion reflected continued strong performance, combined with high market demand, across a variety of our strategies and products. And both of our fixed income affiliates benefited from the money in motion that continues to be underway in fixed income. Equity flows turned negative, with small cap being our most challenged area, while U.S. large-cap and income-oriented products continued turning in strong performance.
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's lower rate primarily reflecting the decline in average AUM at Royce.
Now I'd like to step back for a minute and talk about how this connects to our revenues. Since we've noted over the last few quarters, when you look at net revenue, which is operating revenues less D&S expenses, we seem to be right in line with external estimates. But external expectations around gross operating revenues have continued to run a bit high. On a go-forward basis, using the current quarter's advisory fee rate is a good starting point, with D&S expenses as a percentage of operating revenues typically running between 21% and 22% after excluding performance fees, which will be a good proxy for that line item. So bottomline, we are just trying to get external estimates of our top line more in line with how we see our actual experience.
Operating expenses, on Slide 13, increased by $26 million or 5% to $600 million. I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items, D&S expense decreased, as last quarter's expense included the impact of the Western closed-end fund launch. Occupancy expense increased $11 million, primarily related to the QS integration lease charge as well as from the impact of a prior-quarter lease reserve credit. Communications and technology expenses increased $3 million due to Martin Currie expenses and the continued investment in global distribution. Other expenses increased $4 million due to Martin Currie, offset by the loss of a partial quarter of LMIC and also reflecting additional investments in global distribution.
Turning to Slide 14. Comp and benefits increased by $16 million. The increase was primarily due to higher performance fees and higher global distribution sales commissions. The addition of Martin Currie's expenses were partially offset by the reduction from LMIC. Transition costs and severance were also up due to the LMIC sale, while mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed also increased quarter-over-quarter.
The compensation and benefits ratio, excluding the LMIC charges and the mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, came in at 54%, consistent with our outlook for a 53% to 54% ratio going forward. Next quarter's ratio will likely be a bit higher due to seasonal compensation costs.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which decreased to 21.4% from last quarter's 23.8%. The lower margin was primarily due to the increase in QS integration costs as well as the costs related to M&A activity in the quarter. This quarter's operating margin was reduced by 3.3% as a result of those costs, while the prior quarter's operating margin was similarly reduced by 2%. We would expect the operating margin, as adjusted, to increase next quarter due to the absence of integration costs and M&A activity, but that increase will be partially offset by the increase in seasonal compensation costs, the incremental investments in global distribution as well as lower estimated performance fees.
Slide 16 is a roll forward from fiscal Q2's GAAP earnings per share of $0.04 to this quarter's $0.67 per share. Fiscal Q2 included the debt refinancing and QS investors' integration as well as other corporate initiative costs of approximately $119 million, which combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.65. In fiscal Q3, increases in operating income, as well as the impact of share repurchases, increased earnings per share by $0.01.
Mark-to-market on seed investments were positive this quarter compared with negative marks last quarter. And together with lower interest expense resulting from our refinancing in fiscal Q2, these collectively increased EPS by $0.03.
And finally, a combination of QS integration, the net cost of the LMIC disposition, Martin Currie acquisition costs, all partially offset by a reduction in tax reserves, reduced earnings by a net $0.06 per share.
I'll wrap up on Slide 17, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 50 million shares or 31% since March of 2010. In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over that same time frame. We now have 5 straight years of increased annual dividends, representing over a fourfold increase since 2010. On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which stands at $665 million as of December 31, up slightly from September despite the acquisition of Martin Currie in fiscal Q3. Finally, on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $374 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class.
In summary, this was a solid quarter for Legg Mason. And as always, we have complemented our growth with a capital deployment strategy that highlights consistent dividends and share repurchases, along with significant investments in growth initiatives both organically and through acquisitions.
So thanks for your time and your interest in Legg Mason. And now I'll turn it back to Joe."

Building momentum and positioning Legg Mason for growth have been our themes for this fiscal year, and I think it's quite clear that we're making good progress on both. Continued growth in global distribution gross and net sales reflect a strong lineup of highly competitive products and strong sales execution. With nearly 90% of the hiring associated with our distribution growth plans complete, we will expand client coverage by approximately 50%, which will be a key driver of future growth and progress.
We are excited about the expanded set of capabilities that we've acquired in QS and Martin Currie. There remains a significant opportunity within fixed income for active global managers. And with our deep expertise, scale, a strong breadth of products and compelling investment performance, we are well positioned to gain market share and grow. We also enjoy broad capabilities and strong investment performance across many of our equity products and see opportunities to continue to win in active equities across the globe.
As I said upfront, even as we continue to invest in organic growth and M&A, we will continue to actively return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
And with that, we are happy to take your questions."

As it relates to the implications of passive to QS, I don't think it's any more or less than any of our affiliates. I think it's all about performance over time. Now in the case of QS, I mean this was not performance related. It was really just a move and an allocation move on the part of the client to passive. 
But I see actually there are opportunities growing. As I mentioned, we've seen significant uptake from our global distribution platform, particularly with respect to the insurance sub-advise space. We got on 6 different platforms this past quarter. We mentioned LPL. We got on Prudential, Transamerica, Lincoln National, NPH. We are making great progress and there's a good uptake. We also had positive net flows in our retail distribution platform for QS. So I'm not particularly concerned or any more concerned about the passive threat to QS than I am about anyone else. 
As it relates to Martin Currie, this just takes time, and it's a grinding kind of a thing. We have to get it -- we're working to get Martin Currie into the U.S. space in 40 Act vehicles, as well as UCITS vehicles, obviously, across the pond. It might be 6 or 9 months, candidly, before we get them in. It just takes time. And we've got to be patient with it. But what I will tell you is we're firing on all cylinders. Our product teams are all over Martin Currie, maybe overwhelming them a little bit, but all over them in terms of getting their strategies into vehicles that we can sell in the retail market space."

And as we've said in the past, there's a number of kind of key factors that are moving around in our margin all the time, and we refer to it as mix that matters. So there's really 4 kind of key mix things: which affiliate is the revenue and growth coming from, what asset classes, what client types and what geographies, because they all have different impacts on our margin. So -- and none of them move in the same direction. They all move, but rarely do they ever all move in the same direction. 
But we also had some, I think, key factors in this quarter, most of which are going to turn around and be positive going forward. But the first is just our continued investment in LMGD. And as we've talked about, we're -- we see great opportunity from expanding our coverage and doing some additional things on the technology side there. We've made investments in the past, really going back to when Joe was running it a couple of years ago. And those have taken a bit of time to pay off, but that's what you're seeing pay off now in higher sales. And we're very confident that we're going to get higher sales, net sales, from the investments we're making today. 
The other thing we're seeing is, because of the record sales, keep in mind, we have a lot of front-end-loaded costs in our sales commission structure whenever we sell product through the retail channel. So we had a couple million dollars of incremental commissions this quarter because of record sales, so that's a good thing, particularly given the fact that we'll have those assets for 4 to 5 years and no additional commission coming from that. 
And then a couple other factors: the swap of Martin Currie coming in, in a bit of a lower margin than LMIC, but we have the ability and are seeing it to grow Martin Currie that we didn't have with LMIC, so a much stronger platform. And then minor impact from FX. We're pretty well naturally hedged there but not perfectly. I know that's one that's been on people's minds in terms of currency impact, had a slight impact on us, not that much. 
So bottom line, we're very confident we can improve the margin from here by controlling costs. And as you can see, we've been doing that consistently over the last 2 to 3 years. But more importantly, growing revenues. And the product gaps that we filled already with these acquisitions, the next-generation products that Tom Hoops and his team are pumping out, and then the payback that we're already seeing from prior year investments in LMGD. We're very confident and bullish on the payback opportunity from these current investments."

You may recall, because I think you've been covering us for quite a while, that when we acquired Permal in 2005, December of 2005, that business was almost exclusively a European high-net-worth business. And going through the crisis and following the crisis, for Permal and really for the industry, that business has been in decline and, frankly, in attrition. And I would argue that Permal has really done a remarkable job in transforming their business from what was just over 0%. I've kind of made the comment that I think they had one institutional client when we acquired them. And after the acquisition, we had 0. Today, that business is roughly 70% institutional. 
Now when I talk about it transitioning in that European high-net-worth business, in attrition, I think that is a broad industry trend, but it doesn't mean that there's not opportunities on the retail side. And what we're doing with Permal, we have launched in the U.S. a liquid alternatives strategy that we're excited about. I think I mentioned the launch of a product in the MetLife system this past quarter. We have launched other kind of liquid alternatives type products in the U.S. And we're close, I think, in the next quarter -- in this quarter or next, should have a UCITS vehicle for Permal to be able to address the retail space in Europe and other places. So again, they've really transitioned their business dramatically from basically an entirely retail business to an institutional business, but there is opportunity in the retail side that we think we can capture over time."

I think the short answer to that is yes, we are seeing some business there and we expect to see some additional business there. But as I mentioned in my comments, evaluating how much of our flows are related to money in motion versus what were good, strong underlying core growth trends for both Western and Brandywine, it's a bit of an art and science. What we saw and the way we sort of experienced it was we saw immediate moves in the retail space, as you would imagine, a number of people moving in, whether it be in mutual funds, whether it be in SMAs, where we have a very strong presence. I think we're the second largest provider of SMAs in the industry. We saw a great pickup in SMAs. We saw a very strong pickup in our mutual fund market share over the last 3 months. So that was sort of the immediate uptake. 
We did see in the insurance sub-advise and some DCIO mandates come in fairly quickly, where they were able to pull the trigger faster in those spaces. We did see some uptake there. I would say that the institutional business that we -- that kind of the traditional consultant-driven institutional business just takes time. And we do believe this is a plus, minus 2-year type of phenomena because you're dealing with consultants. You're dealing with investment committees. You're dealing with boards that have to go through a much longer process. We think that'll be kind of lumpy. We think it'll be kind of -- it'll ebb and flow a little bit over time. We are pleased for -- Western in particular has seen significant improvement in their consultant rankings and their opportunities based on consultants. So that gives us a good feel about the opportunities before us from that standpoint. So we feel good. 
One of the things I'll tell you is that -- that I think is interesting, and again, this reinforces the underlying momentum of our fixed income business away from the money in motion phenomena, and that is that, of our  unfunded wins on a forward-looking basis, from December 31 on, only a very, very small amount of that is actually related to the money in motion. And so the vast majority of that is really the underlying core strength of our fixed income business that we would have seen in any respect."

We do acknowledge and recognize that the passive space has got a legitimate place in investors' portfolios. Active managers are going to struggle when correlations are low, and that's sort of been the case. And so it's always on us as an active manager to prove our worth and to actually deliver alpha in excess of the fees that we charge. So we get that. We understand that. 
As it relates to our international platform, what we've said for a long time up until our recent acquisition of Martin Currie was that really we were working on global fixed income capabilities and global fixed income products and that we only had U.S. equity capabilities, for the most part, to be able to offer to the retail investor. Our global fixed income capability, where we're seeing the uptake there is not really in Core and Core Plus or broad market strategies, but we're seeing significant -- a significant ramp in the absolute return in unconstrained strategies. There's great uptake there, as well as the global opportunistic strategies that Brandywine has. 
So it's a very, very significant part of our business globally. And we see our market share has grown dramatically in U.S. equities, in active U.S. equities internationally. And we see, over time, our ability to grow our non-U.S. equity space with the addition of Martin Currie and as well as a few select non-U.S. equity strategies at ClearBridge, for example, or Brandywine."

And what you've seen on that, on the graph where we plot out the advisory fee rate is some very, very tiny changes because they're kind of 5 digits right of the decimal point. But we're not oblivious to the trend. And I like the way you framed it. It's both the near term and the longer term, or intermediate to longer term, because right now what's driving that, the majority of that is really driven by mix from our 2 highest fee affiliates: Royce, which is higher fee equity and retail assets, and obviously they're in some outflows and we expect those to last for a bit; but also, Permal has been a negative contributor. But that's kind of a ""good news, bad news"" story. The bad news side, as Joe said, high net worth is kind of moving away from the space, but institutional is coming in. And institutional tends be a bifurcation of fees, so it's still a higher fee than our average products in other areas, but it's lower than what the high-net-worth guys are paying. A flip side to that is that also comes with performance fee opportunities, and those really haven't kicked in. 
So we're modestly bullish around that impact kind of mitigating itself going forward. But so those are kind of the negatives, but there's a number of positives that are working through the system, and we're seeing real value from those today. It just hasn't quite yet offset the negative impacts, the other ones. And those include the fact that we're seeing very positive flows out of ClearBridge and Brandywine on their equity products. Secondly, we're doing a number of proactive things that are going to help to address this. Obviously, you've seen the affiliate acquisitions, both Martin Currie in particular but even QS tend to have higher fee products than the blended rate. All of the next-generation products that Tom Hoops' team are working on and pumping out are generally at higher fee, including 2 liquid-alt products that we have just launched with Permal. And we're looking at launching a third that will go to the retail space. 
And then probably most importantly is the strong trend from LMGD, Legg Mason Global Distribution, both in the U.S. but even more importantly internationally. So those assets also come higher. So I'd say there's a chance this thing might dip some more, but we're dealing with 1/1,000 of a percent now where it's dipping before it turns up. But we're pretty confident as we look forward in our projections that, that starts climbing towards the middle of this calendar year."

And then just a quick follow-up. Given the investments that you guys are making on the distribution side and maybe getting some of the past ones that you've made, from a time frame, and maybe given the mix of products that you have in the suite now versus what you had in the past, when do you expect to see some of that traction build? I think it's hard because, obviously, at $9 billion of inflows in the quarter, it's not like you don't have traction, but that might be more weighed towards -- that might be weighted -- more weighted towards fixed income. And so when you're making these investments on the distribution side, when and like maybe where can we see that traction over the next couple quarters or 1 to 2 years?"

And I'd say it would be modest in the next few quarters, but I think over the next couple of years is when we would see it. We are adding. Our investments include people, where we, at the end of the day, are expecting our client-facing capability to be raised -- or our number of people that are client-facing to be up by about 50%. We're very close to being completed with the hiring of those resources, of those people. I think we're about 90% done with the hiring associated with that. And so ultimately, we would say our client-facing activity will be up 50%. That's only a good thing. 
And I would say that what is of particular benefit to us today, even versus a few years ago when we were making investments, is the momentum at Legg Mason, the number of products, as I mentioned earlier, that are relevant and that are high performing kind of give you a chance to ramp that a little bit more quickly. 
Now the other thing, in addition to investing in people, we're investing in technology and training. And the technology and training is an opportunity to accelerate and leverage our existing sales force. So it's not all about kind of investing in the future, but as we get -- as our technology investment takes hold and as our training, which is already underway, investment takes hold, our existing sales force can be more productive and more effective. So it's kind of a good environment for us, for our newer people who are getting out and making new contacts and relationships. The buzz and the momentum around Legg Mason will help them and should accelerate the opportunity to get a return on that. And then the technology and training investments will help our existing sales force that already have those relationships."

I think, candidly, our model, increasingly smaller boutiques are seeing our model is very attractive because we honor the investment independence and operational autonomy concept. And then the power of global distribution, I mean, I can't tell you how many firms are contacting us. They'd love for us to kind of sub-advise for them. We're not going to do that. We hold dear this global distribution platform we have, and you kind of have to be part of the team to have access to it. 
So we're an attractive acquirer right now. We're going to be selective as it relates to either adding incremental discrete investment capability that we think just adds to our lineup, and there are things out there that could come into play. Or upgrading, as our affiliates look to upgrade potentially talent or reinforce and strengthen talent and strengthen their succession, we could do lift-outs and things like that.

So we do see that happening and we are experiencing some of that, but we think that that's a longer-term trend as well. 
As it relates to sort of the passive and that whole question, whether it be retail or institutional, and I said this in my prepared remarks, we feel just very strongly that there's a role for both, right? We do believe that there's a role for both, but particularly right now in fixed income, it feels like about the worst time to be passive in your investing because it doesn't allow for you to try to negate or hedge in some way or otherwise obviate the requirements that -- and the lack of flexibility that you have when you're benchmark investing. So quite frankly, I think, increasingly, with rates where they are and with the -- there's a general consensus rates are going to move higher at some point. Whether it's shorter term, longer term, they are going to move higher. There's obviously a lot of currency impact in the markets. There's a lot of credit, both corporate credit and sovereign risk issues out there. And just simply passively investing exposes you in a way and exposes clients in a way that we think is a mistake, and increasingly, our clients are listening to that and hearing that. So we think the opportunity for active management, broadly speaking, is important. And we have to demonstrate it and prove it nowhere more so than in fixed income right now."

I may also talk about oil as well and energy because that -- it was a question that didn't come up but I'm sure is on people's minds. But the FX impact for us is almost de minimis. We've been watching the dollar strengthen against the yen, the euro, the pound pretty much the whole year. And the total impact for us is probably about $0.01 or a little bit more than that in terms of earnings per share. So we're pretty well naturally hedged between our expense pool and P&L overseas. And again, part of that is we get a lot more dollar -- investments from overseas, but they come in, in U.S. dollars in many cases. 
The other thing I'd add is on oil, because we've got several exposures there both on the equity and the fixed income side, and equity, we're about 6% across all of our portfolios. That compares to broad market indices which would say energy would be an 8% weighting. So overall, we're under-market exposed to start with, but about half of our exposure is ClearBridge, in their MLP vehicles, which mostly are focused on midstream, so transportation, pipelines in particular. They tend not to move directly -- their earnings don't move with the price of oil and, if anything, will benefit from longer term. If oil stays down for longer, there will be more demand for transportation. So we're not too worried about the MLPs. When you take those out, we're less than 4% exposed in the equity side, so half the -- half of market exposure in energy. 
And pretty much a similar story in fixed income. Less than 3% of our fixed income portfolio is exposed to energy. There isn't really a broad market index, but you can look at a number of different ones. When we look at all of them in total, we see the market in fixed income being more like 5% to 6%. So again, we're less than half in both of those spaces. Is that helpful? Thank you for the question."

Good morning, everyone. And as always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason. I welcome you to our fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2015 earnings call.
But before we start this morning, I'd like to thank the many of you who have reached out to us with expressions of support and offers to help during these difficult days for Baltimore. It has been a great deal to me personally and to all of Legg Mason to know that during such challenging times, our industry colleagues see the bigger picture and focus on the most important issues.
I want you to know that while what has happened in our city has been profoundly disturbing, we believe in Baltimore and are committed to joining with the city to work through our challenges and come through this better and stronger.
Baltimore is a strong, tough town that will heal and will get better. And we intend to stand shoulder to shoulder to help make that happen. Again, please accept my deep appreciation for your concern and your support.
So as we enter our new fiscal year, energized by significant progress and clear growth momentum, and significant opportunities to address the meaningful challenges our clients face, I am proud to say that the company has largely delivered on the key strategic initiatives that we have outlined over the past few years. And this positions us to grow in the short term, while strengthening our foundation for the long term.
Over the past couple of years, we have tightened up our class structure and improve our operating efficiency, while significantly modifying our affiliate portfolio to better leverage our global distribution platform. We've expanded our lineup of client relevant products, invested further in our global distribution platform, significantly improved our capital structure, and we've achieved all of this while leading the industry in our rate of return in capital to shareholders. 
And I'm pleased to report that we have declared a dividend of $0.20 per share, up 25% over last year. And perhaps, most importantly, we have returned to organic growth, generating nearly $17 billion in positive long-term flows in actively managed products.
We have achieved this flow turnaround at a time when industry active managed strategies have been challenged, due in large part to high correlations across most asset classes.
In my closing remarks this morning, I will highlight 5 key takeaways that we believe are critical to understanding Legg Mason today and our broader strategy for tomorrow. But for now, suffice it to say that I believe Legg Mason to be in the early innings of a compelling, long-term growth story.
Our return to positive long-term flows underscores the power of our multi-affiliate model. It is the diversity of our offerings that best serves the needs of our investor clients. That same diversity of investment capabilities of clients, geography and affiliates will deliver for our shareholders with multiple sources of growth and across a wide range of revenue streams.
Our clients face many challenges globally, including persistently low interest rates, volatility in the commodity and currency markets, and global geopolitical turmoil. These and other factors have impacted economic activity and the potential for earnings growth. However, we believe these are macro trends that can offer thoughtful investors substantial opportunity.
Around the world, demographic factors, combined with lower economic growth rates, especially in developed countries, are creating challenges for governments, businesses and retirement systems, as more individuals move toward retirement. The significant need for, and demand for both growth and income solutions, is an enduring global phenomena that we can help solve. 
Even amidst many current challenges, we see investment opportunities expanding dramatically across multiple asset classes and sectors, including energy, technology, biotech and infrastructure, among others. Therefore, it's an exciting time for those who can identify and manage these opportunities.
We remain convinced that having a truly global perspective, a diversity of high-performing investment capabilities and product solutions, and highly effective ways to bring these capabilities to market is critical. This is what Legg Mason offers. It defines us.
And now, let's discuss the quarter and fiscal year.
Slide 2 shows the quarterly financial highlights for the company. In brief, my takeaway, we have delivered another solid quarter of financial and strategic improvement, our fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows and reinforce this improvement with the 25% increase in our dividend that I referenced earlier. I am very pleased with this continued progress.
Now Slide 3 shows assets under management at each of our affiliates. As I will discuss on the next slide, my perspective is simply, we have a solid foundation for growth with these affiliates, both I the capabilities and products that they have today, and new products we are launching with an active ongoing development pipeline.
Slide 4 provides a snapshot of our affiliates, highlighting their flows and unfunded wins.
As I look at our affiliate portfolio, I see 3 broad categories. First, high-quality affiliate franchises, whose investment styles are currently out of favor. Permal and Royce fall into this category. Both are strong franchises and strategically important, and both will be long-term growth stories for Legg Mason. In the case of Permal, whose flows were basically flat for the year, the eventual return to a normalized less correlated market should benefit their business greatly.
In the case of Royce, which experienced meaningful outflows during the year, the eventual return to a normalized market should reward the high-quality company investment bias, for which Royce has long been known.
QS and Martin Currie are in the second affiliate category. Both firms have filled important investment capability gaps for us and have demonstrated excellent short and long-term prospects. Broadly speaking, we are still in the process of commercializing the investment capabilities of Martin Currie. And while we have experienced some early small wins together, those of you in the business know, product creation work among vehicles and across jurisdictions simply takes time.
As for QS, which will be celebrating its 1-year anniversary with Legg Mason in June, we're to see the power of our global distribution capabilities in tandem with investment capabilities at QS.
As of March 31, QS had $1.5 billion in unfunded wins, underscoring continued strong industry demand for multi-asset class solutions and early success, leveraging our Legg Mason distribution team specifically within the sub-advisory channel. In April, QS was awarded an additional $2.9 billion sub-advisory mandate, which will fund in July. These unfunded wins, now totaling $4.4 billion at QS, are completely incremental to the platform wins that I referenced last quarter. Those platform wins, which start from a small asset base, have the potential for significant asset growth over time.
And finally, our 3 remaining affiliates: Brandywine, ClearBridge and Western, which are the engines of our current growth.
Brandywine achieved strong inflows this fiscal year across all their product categories, including fixed income, multi-asset class and equity, and their pipeline remains robust.
Performance at Brandywine is broadly strong in equities and exceptional in fixed income across all time periods and since inception for their strategies. The bottom line for Brandywine is this: They are engaged in very active product developments; they are delivering strong investment performance; and they are experiencing meaningful growth momentum in both retail and institutional channel. In fact, 18 of Brandywine's investment strategies, representing 98% of the company's AUM, have been positive net flows for the fiscal year.
Now ClearBridge. Against an industry narrative that has questioned the ability of active managers to deliver alpha, that's a narrative to which we do not subscribe, by the way, investment performance at ClearBridge is strong, particularly in the 3- and 5-year periods. 10 ClearBridge funds have share classes that are rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar, demonstrating the breadth and quality of the ClearBridge product lineup. 16 discrete and differentiated strategies representing almost 75% of Clearbridge's AUM have positive net flows for the fiscal year.
Now I'm not sure this is well known or appreciated outside of Legg Mason, but ClearBridge has a remarkably successful history of creating new investment franchises within their business. ClearBridge was among the first movers in 2 [ph] categories that today are considered mainstream: Dividend income and MLPs. And today, ClearBridge is expanding both its ESG franchise and continuing to build out of its institutional business. 
And finally, Western asset. Western has returned to growth and continues to deliver very strong performance, with more than 90% of strategy AUM, outperforming benchmarks in the 3- and 5-year period, a powerful record. That performance has recently earned the company prestigious awards from both Morningstar and Institutional Investor, among others.
As a result of Western's investment performance and continued progress on risk management, consultant ratings critical to the institutional business have significantly improved, which is exciting for Western's prospects. Just this past fiscal year, 5 of 15 top consultants upgraded Western, while 7 others raised their outlook. Western's return to positive, long-term flows over the past several quarters reflects the money in motion phenomena that we've discussed. But equally important, the strong interest in both their legacy credit strategies and unconstrained and specialized strategies, which we believe positions them very well into the eventuality of a rising rate environment.
Slide 5 shows some of the many awards won by Legg Mason and our affiliates during the year. I'm certainly very proud of my Legg Mason and affiliate colleagues for the hard work and high-quality results that such public recognition represents. Congratulations to all of you.
Slide 6 highlights the significant momentum we've seen this year in global distribution. Our record gross and net sales reflect in part the investments we made in distribution over the last several years, which are now paying off.
As pleased as we are with distribution's performance this past year, we believe that we are positioned to accelerate its performance from here for 3 reasons: Our diversification of products, clients and geographies will work for us; our continued investment in distribution will work for us; and our momentum in the marketplace will work for us. 
So let me be a bit more specific. First, the diversification inherent in our business by client type, geography, product and strategy, provides us with ample opportunities to grow our business. We are not beholden to or dependent upon a single or small group of products or client channels or geographies. 
For example, the concentration of our growth sales in the U.S. among our top 3 selling funds is only just over 1/3 of our total sales, according to a well-known industry consultant, who has done analytical work for us. This means that almost 2/3 of our mutual fund sales in the U.S. are in products other than from our top 3 selling products. Of the 50 firms of all sizes surveyed by the consultant, 40 have higher concentrations of sales in top 3 products than Legg Mason.
Additionally, every 1 of our 6 global distribution regions is in positive net flows. And with the exception of Royce, all of our affiliates are in positive net flow within our retail distribution platform. This is exactly the kind of diversification that we intend to build out further.
Second, we've invested in distribution platform by hiring nearly 50 client-facing staff, whose impact is largely yet to come. We are enhancing our sales team's effectiveness through global sales training, increasing the air cover for them in the field with robust marketing initiatives and creative publicity campaigns, and increasing the efficiency of our sales teams by introducing predictive analytics to help pinpoint investor need and opportunity.
And finally, we start the fiscal year with the significant momentum in the retail channel globally, with improvement in gross sales of 26% year-over-year, up from 15% growth the previous 2 years. Don't underestimate the power of momentum within a sales organization and in a marketplace with clients. We expect to continue to capitalize on that momentum, reflecting a deep partnership with both our global distribution partners and affiliates, which is paying off with a meaningful increase in sales, net flows and market share gains.
Underscoring that momentum, Legg Mason has moved up 11 positions year-over-year to #12 in our quarterly U.S. retail market sales ranking for active funds. And in U.S. taxable fixed income, our share of gross sales has doubled year-over-year, again, according to our industry consultant.
In retail SMAs, we are the #2 provider in the industry with $48 billion in assets. 
And finally, our cross-border market share has also increased significantly year-over-year, which we expect to continue as we commercialize products, especially with our newer affiliates. These are all testaments to the investments that we have made, the great work by our teams, and speak directly to why we believe this platform has significant momentum and quite a lot more room to run. 
Slide 7 shows the expansion of our investment capabilities, which together with our distribution platform, is a key driver of growth.
We define the market as having 3 broad opportunity sets in product development: Classic active, next-generation active and passive. Traditional, classic active is defined as style box, benchmark-oriented strategies that are broadly losing share to passive strategies. Here, we are growing by taking a bigger slice of a shrinking, albeit, enormously large market opportunity. 
Winning in the classic active space is take share game given by strong investment performance and effective distribution capabilities. We have both.
With the exception of some of our small cap strategies, the strength we enjoy in high active share and income products, when combined with strong distribution alpha, is driving robust sales for many of our affiliates.
Now while the classic active products are broadly an outflow within the industry, next-generation active products, such as flexible, alternative and outcome-oriented strategies, are receiving strong investor demand. And we are extremely active in NexGen product development and distribution. In fact, in just under 3 years, we have more than doubled AUM in NexGen active products, and we are accelerating that effort. We can continue to expand our list of NexGen active products, both organically and through M&A.
As you can see on the slide, building on the 23 products that we launched last year, we call -- we also through acquisitions of Martin Currie and QS Investors, added significant new investment capabilities, which have yet to be fully commercialized into retail products.
And then finally, the passive space. We certainly see an evolution of a market, which has been dominated by cap-weighted index strategies, a commoditized and highly-competitive segment, largely driven by price. The evolution in passive strategies is a migration of interest to smart beta strategies, which seek to correct or overcome the limitations associated with pure cap-weighted index products.
We have existing smart beta capabilities with QS, and a number of our other managers are also evaluating the strategies against their own investment capabilities. We view smart beta to be an opportunity to compete for flows that have been moving to index products for some time. We also see the continued expansion of the ETF as a compelling investment vehicle for some investors, and therefore, another growth opportunity for Legg Mason. We believe that there are opportunities to use the ETF wrapper to translate our affiliates' investment expertise into innovative products.
While this is certainly a multi-year initiative for us, we are extremely excited about the addition of our new ETF team, giving us the potential for extensions of existing products and the creation of new products in ETF wrappers.
Slide 8 shows our investment performance. While the 1-year number dipped a bit, we've seen before that it can bounce around. That said, I'm very pleased to say that performance remains broadly strong across most time periods.
And with that, Pete, now I'll turn it over to you."
180481,291739513,800113,"Legg Mason Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 01, 2015",2015-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 9. As Joe noted, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings with net income of $83 million or $0.73 per share.

As Joe noted, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings with net income of $83 million or $0.73 per share. And this is our first quarter in some time where we have no integration or other initiative costs, so a clean quarter that we have all been looking forward to.
At a high level, our revenues decreased, primarily due to 2 fewer days in the quarter and lower performance fees. On the expense side, the majority of the decline was related to comp and benefits driven by the reduction in revenues i
Adjusted income was $118 million for the quarter or $1.03 per share. Average long-term AUM was up a net 1% from the prior quarter, with average fixed income up 2% and equity down 1%.
This quarter's performance fees of $24 million came from a diverse group of our affiliates, specifically Brandywine, Martin Currie, Permal and Western. These were better than forecasted as a result of strong performance at both Brandywine and Martin Currie.
While impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
In terms of capital deployment, this quarter, we repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares and ended the fiscal year with only $14 million left on our previous authorization. We have fully deployed that amount in April and are already acting on our new $1 billion authorization, continuing at our usual $90 million quarterly pace, subject as always to markets and any alternative capital uses.
Moving on to Slide 10. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. This quarter's lower than typical rate resulted from true ups in our final return filings for fiscal '14, as well as changes in our valuation reserves on deferred tax assets due to final income apportionment across our various tax and jurisdictions. This combined to increase our earnings per share by $0.03 this quarter.
Next quarter, we are anticipating that our tax rate will be favorably impacted by a recently legislated change in the New York City apportionment rules that will reduce our fiscal Q1 taxes by approximately $10 million to $20 million. Excluding this item, we expect our GAAP tax rate for the full fiscal year to be between 35% and 37%.
And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter, we were at 6%, and for next fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 4% to 5%, as you can see a Page 21 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 11. Our assets under management were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by a $15 billion decline in liquidity AUM. This more than offset a 2% increase in long-term AUM and a $2.7 billion favorable market impact in the quarter, which was net of $6.3 billion of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
Long-term flows on Slide 12 were a positive $6.2 billion and represented our fourth straight quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $7.6 billion reflected continued strong performance, combined with high market demand across a variety of our strategies and products. Equity flows were negative, with small cap being the primary driver, while U.S. large cap and income-oriented products continue to generate strong inflows.
Looking ahead, our April flows will likely be negative based on what we know at the moment, given they will be impacted by a $1.9 billion redemption at Western that arose from a client diversifying managers and was unrelated to performance.
But as we have said in the past, any 1 month does not make a trend, especially, in the lumpy world of his institutional flows. And to that point, we are also aware, our May flows will benefit from the $1.5 billion of equity wins at QS, which Joe mentioned earlier. Given the higher fees on these equity wins versus the lower fees of the fixed income redemption, the net result of this activity will actually be revenue accretive. 
Advisory fees on Slide 13 shows our average quarterly AUM along with the advisory fee trend, with this quarter's higher rate, primarily reflecting the growth in retail assets at Western and ClearBridge, which were partially offset by the challenges at Royce. 
Operating expenses on Slide 14 decreased by $27 million or 4% to $573 million. 
I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items, DNS expense decreased, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter. Occupancy expense decreased $7 million as last quarter's number included the QS integration lease charge. 
Communication and technology expense increased $2 million, reflecting additional cost at affiliates that were offset in compensation and benefits. And finally, other expenses decreased $2 million as last quarter's expenses included costs related to the Martin Currie acquisition and the disposition of LMIC.
Turning to Slide 15. Salary and incentives decreased by $17 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues resulting from the 2 fewer days in the quarter and lower performance fees. These more than offset the increase in benefits and payroll taxes due to seasonal factors. 
Transition costs and severance decreased, as last quarter included QS integration costs and costs related to the LMIC sale. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 54%, at the higher end of our expected range due to the usual seasonal factors, which will also affect our next fiscal quarter.
Slide 16 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased 23.8% from last quarter's 21.4%.The prior quarter's lower margin was primarily due to the QS integration costs, as well as costs related to M&A activity in the quarter. The combination of these factors served to reduce fiscal Q3's operating margin by 3.3%.
Slide 17 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 to this quarter's $0.73 per share. Fiscal Q3 included QS integration costs, as well as expenses related to the purchase of Martin Currie and the sale of LMIC. These were partially offset by a reduction in tax reserves and the capital gain on LMIC, all of which combined to reduce last quarter's earnings per share by $0.06.
This quarter, the combination of lower revenues from the 2 fewer days, lower performance fees, seasonally higher benefits and payroll taxes, which were all slightly offset by a lower share count, reduced EPS by $0.05.
Higher mark-to-market on our seed investments increased EPS by $0.02. Also in fiscal Q4, as I previously noted, year-end tax items increased earnings per share by $0.03.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which highlights our quarterly cash position, as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment.
In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 52 million shares or 32% since March 2010. In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same time frame. We now have 6 straight years of increased annual dividends, representing virtually a 6-fold increase since 2010. And while not not shown here, our rate of return in capital to shareholders, reflecting both our stock buyback program and our regularly quarterly dividend, was industry-leading over the last year and it's been nearly double the peer average over the past 4 years.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which stands at $670 million as of March 31, up slightly from December 31.
Finally on the bottom right, we highlight our current seat investments of $391 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. This is a $17 million increase from Q3 as we continue to support our new product development efforts.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter for Legg Mason. And as always, we have complimented our growth with the capital deployment strategy that highlights consistent dividends and share repurchases along with significant investments in growth initiatives, both organically and through acquisitions. 
So thanks for your time and your interest in Legg Mason. And now, I'll turn it back to Joe."

But when you look at mix, it t really 5 different factors. It's a combination of what affiliates, what products, what asset classes, what geography and what clients. And so I think it was a combination of all of those things that helped to drive the margin. But as we look forward, it's really about growing the bottom line. And so we're focused about bottom line, growing the topline. The margin will be an outcome, but a lot of that, again, is based on the mix.

Bill, my views on that are not really any different than they'e been for a while. First of all, I think this whole notion, this whole discussion about transparency, non-transparency, I think the jury is still way out on this. We, to be clear, are far from convinced that transparency is a huge issue for our PMs. In fact, we know for sure with some of our PMs that they have no issue with transparency. But now that said, to be clear, there could be some strategies, there may be some markets where non-transparency ETS make sense, but I don't think blanket statement saying transparency is a problem, we will disagree with that. Obviously, the adoption of what our now sort of these nontransparent ETFs in the marketplace, it has not been particularly robust and we're going to continue to monitor and evaluate it, but there's really no rush on our part to get there. What I would -- what we haven't really talked a lot about, Bill, but we're excited about, is obviously we do think 2 things. We think ETFs, the broad appetite of ETFs and being able to bring our -- some of our existing strategies into ETFs or create new strategies in ETF vehicles, clearly, there's demand for that vehicle and that structure. And so obviously, we hired a team during the quarter to really build out that effort for us. And then secondly, the opportunity in Smart Beta. You kind of referenced Smart Beta, and we see this as an evolving opportunity to capture flows that have been going into passive. We're excited about both Smart Beta and the opportunity to commercialize some of our strategies into ETFs. So it's an evolving discussion, we think, both of which provide opportunities for growth for us."

So if you think back to the previous quarter, we had $7.6 billion of net fixed income flows, but we estimate only $1.1 billion of that was related to the money in motion phenomena. What that means, that $6.5 billion of our fixed income flows for that, for this previous quarter, what I would consider to be our kind of ongoing organic growth and fixed income. Now if you look back to the December quarter, we had $9.9 billion in fixed income flows, but 2/3 of those were really related to the money in motion. So what -- we see this as a positive. We see this as affirming the fact that our -- we've been building and growing our fixed income business, both retail and institutional for some time now. So the money in motion opportunities are going to be largely institutional going forward, are going to be a long and lumpy processes. We think Western and Brandywine are well positioned to grow there from the money in motion. But also, and really maybe more importantly, from the organic growth opportunities. What we're seeing right now, broadly in terms of client mix, is that we're continuing to get good flows in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. both in retail and institutional. So if you look back over the last quarter, our fixed income business was split basically 63% or so retail, 37% institutional, and then 50-50 U.S. and international. So really nice balance, really nice diversification. We are seeing in the money in motion, a lot of that is really what we would call the classic debt. A lot of those flows are going into Core and Core Plus because that's kind of a like-for-like, where they're leaving a certain type of strategy and coming to a similar strategy, Core or Core Plus. In the more organic growth that we've been experiencing for some time, more of that is really in the next-generation active products, things like macro ops, global sovereign strategies, absolute return, et cetera, et cetera. So we are really excited about the momentum we have. We still got a lot of -- our pipeline remains fairly robust. We're seeing a lot of opportunities. Again the institutional piece is going to be long lumpy, the money in motion piece, long and lumpy. But we're getting good business, institutional retail, U.S., international, we feel pretty good about it."

But I think you guys read the press just as much as we do and follow the Fed, that's it's only a lot closer today around the timeframe for that increase. But if you look at what we're doing in that space right now, with the impending regular interchange, which is a year and half off, but nonetheless, clients are very, very aggressively looking at what they're going to do with their liquidity money going forward, and that's where Western is spending their time. The key at the end of the day is what kind of products are they looking for? We've only got a pretty good suite of other liquidity-like products, things that are longer duration than 90 days. But still, clients today are using those for liquidity money, where they're willing to give up stable NAV already and go out a little longer on the duration curve. So we're cautiously optimistic that the combination of factors that include the new bank capital rules, where the banks aren't looking for a significant increases in terms of deposits, that that's a bullish sign for us long term. So a combination of as those rigs come into play and as rates go up, that's going to be a more interesting business for us."

Thank you. A couple of things, let me maybe frame it for you. We were actually sitting around, touching yesterday about kind of looking forward from here and how we feel about our flow and our business activity. And I've got to tell you, the team feels very, very positive about it. One of the things, if you think about it, we have reported our unfunded pipeline at the end of September -- at the end of March of being $7.6 [ph] billion. At the end of this month or at the end of April, our unfunded pipeline is $10.1 billion. That's the highest number any of us can remember. I don't know if it's a record or not, but it is the highest any of us can remember. But here's what's interesting, it's almost 60% equity. We've been having very robust activity in the fixed income side, which is terrific, and we still have it. Obviously, 40%, 41% or thereabouts of our kind of April 30 unfunded pipeline, 40%, 41% is fixed income, and that's largely specialized. The good news about that is that's higher fee. But on the equities side, almost 60% is in equity, and that's really across the board. That's ClearBridge, that's Martin Currie, that is QS, that is Brandywine. And so we're getting good breadth. So look, we've talked about Royce, Royce has been challenged. They're going to be challenged for a while, we know that. But the diversity of our model with -- between asset classes, and even within asset classes, is pretty powerful. And we're getting a lot of looks in here right now. So we feel pretty good about it."

And again, just do all the complexity factors in that mix, it's difficult to give you kind of a straight line as to where the margin will go. What we do feel very positive about is the things we can control at the parent level. And you've heard me say before, roughly 75% of our cost at the parent level or kind of quasi-fix in nature, so they go up like inflation, but we don't need to add a lot of cost to add, managing a lot of AUM. Says it's only about 25% of our cost at the the parent level that vary based on the level of sales and the levels of AUM, and those are primarily commission-based salespeople, so they pay for themselves. But the other thing to keep in mind, we had record sales now the last 2 years, coming out of retail global distribution. And we eat the full upfront cost of those commissions in the first year. Yes, we keep those assets for 4 to 5 years, so that's another thing to kind of gives us some real bullish sentiment around the margin over the next couple of years, because we're not going to -- we're going to have assets and we raise a lot of several that aren't going to be costing us any from a commission standpoint. So general, again, cautiously bullish on the margin going up from here, it'll be bumpy just because of all the mixed things. But the main underlying pillars are the leverage at the parent, and then this persistency of assets that we only pay for once upfront on the retailn side. Does that make sense?"

I think, I don't mean to say we have opportunity everywhere, but we sort of do. If you think about it in the U.S. and I referenced some statistics in my prepared remarks about the improvement in terms of our positioning relative to other fund complexes in terms of sales. I think that's very powerful. We made significant progress this past year. The opportunity in fixed income, particularly in the U.S., remains. Now it's going to be slow and it's going to be kind of a slow build and organic, but with Western being named Morningstar's Fixed Income Manager of the Year, , well that gives you a lot of tailwind. If rates rise, which -- we actually, we've been talking to people about we're actually looking forward to rates rising, because obviously, that ultimately makes fixed income more attractive. Western, both Western and Brandywine, we think, performed well or will perform well in a rising rate environment. So we feel well positioned for that. So we think we can continue to capture share in the retail space in fixed income in the U.S. What's exciting for us is internationally, we've always done a good job, and frankly, kind of punched above our weight as it relates to fixed income and even U.S. equities, but we've never really had solutions, manage ball-type things, which is what QS does, or the non-U.S. equity strategies, which obviously Martin Currie does. We are seeing some good traction and some activity with Martin Currie Australia. Now Martin Currie Australia is our legacy Australian equity business that we combined with Martin Currie. That's gone very well, it's been a good combination. We're seeing good traction with Martin Currie Australia, particularly in Asia. But we think we can continue to grow internationally very, very much with many of Martin Currie's strategies once we get them into our cross-border vehicles. So things like Asia long-term unconstrained, European loan short, they've got some strategies that we think are very compelling. They are also very much next-generation strategies. And then we can continue to combine them with our U.S. equity strategies and fixed income, where we are still getting good action internationally.

Thank you, operator. I appreciate it. Look, this morning, I'd like to leave you all with  what I consider to be the 5 key takeaways that we believe are critical to understanding Legg Mason and our long-term opportunities.
First, with nearly $17 billion in long-term flows and a 3% organic growth rate, Legg Mason is definitely back in growth mode. And we look forward to building upon that momentum as we bring QS Investors and Martin Currie more fully online, while we continue to leverage our legacy affiliate growth engines. 
Secondly, the diversification in our model is a key competitive advantage, as our varied affiliates balance one another to the benefit of clients and shareholders over different market cycles.
Third, Legg Mason's global distribution platform represents a significant strategic asset for both our affiliates and our shareholders. This year was a record year for distribution and gross and net sales, and with the exception of Royce, net positive flows across all regions and for all affiliates within LMGD. 
Fourth, we will remain very focused on improving absolute earnings and margin over time by maintaining a rigorous cost discipline, accelerating our organic growth, working to improve our asset mix, and by implementing new management equity plans at our affiliates. Each of these actions can be drivers of improved, long-term profitability and potential margin expansion.
And finally, we will continue to deploy the significant amount of cash that we generate between investments to expand our investment capabilities and distribution, and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So thank you for your time today. I'd like to congratulate my colleagues at Legg Mason and our affiliates for a good quarter and a strong year, and thank our shareholders for your continued trust and confidence. We look forward to rewarding your investment in Legg Mason again over the next year. And with that, I wish you all a wonderful day and weekend."

Good morning, everyone. And as always, I appreciate your interest in Legg Mason. I welcome you to our Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call.
But before we start this morning, I'd like to thank the many of you who have reached out to us with expressions of support and offers to help during these difficult days for Baltimore. It has been a great deal to me personally and to all of Legg Mason to know that during such challenging times, our industry colleagues see the bigger picture and focus on the most important issues. I want you to know that while what has happened in our city has been profoundly disturbing, we believe in Baltimore and are committed to joining with the city to work through our challenges and come through this better and stronger. Baltimore is a strong, tough town that will heal and will get better, and we intend to stand shoulder to shoulder to help make that happen. Again, please accept my deep appreciation for your concern and your support.
So as we enter our new fiscal year energized by significant progress and clear growth momentum and significant opportunities to address the meaningful challenges our clients face, I'm proud to say that the company has largely delivered on the key strategic initiatives that we've outlined over the past few years. And this positions us to grow in the short term while strengthening our foundation for the long term.
Over the past couple of years, we have tightened up our cost structure and improved our operating efficiency while significantly modifying our affiliate portfolio to better leverage our global distribution platform. We've expanded our lineup of client-relevant products, invested further in our global distribution platform, significantly improved our capital structure, and we've achieved all of this while leading the industry in our rate of returning capital to shareholders. 
And I'm pleased to report that we have declared a dividend of $0.20 per share, up 25% over last year. And perhaps most importantly, we have returned to organic growth, generating nearly $17 billion in positive long-term flows in actively managed products. We have achieved this flow turnaround at a time when industry-active managed strategies have been challenged, due in large part to high correlations across most asset classes.
In my closing remarks this morning, I will highlight 5 key takeaways that we believe are critical to understanding Legg Mason today and our broader strategy for tomorrow. But for now, suffice it to say that I believe Legg Mason to be in the early innings of a compelling, long-term growth story.
Our return to positive long-term flows underscores the power of our multi-affiliate model. It is the diversity of our offerings that best serves the needs of our investor clients. That same diversity of investment capabilities of clients, geography and affiliates will deliver for our shareholders with multiple sources of growth and across a wide range of revenue streams.
Our clients face many challenges globally, including persistently low interest rates, volatility in the commodity and currency markets and global geopolitical turmoil. These and other factors have impacted economic activity and the potential for earnings growth. However, we believe these are macro trends that can offer thoughtful investors substantial opportunity.
Around the world, demographic factors, combined with lower economic growth rates, especially in developed countries, are creating challenges for governments, businesses and retirement systems as more individuals move toward retirement. The significant need for and demand for both growth and income solutions is an enduring global phenomena that we can help solve. Even amidst many current challenges, we see investment opportunities expanding dramatically across multiple asset classes and sectors, including energy, technology, biotech and infrastructure, among others. Therefore, it's an exciting time for those who can identify and manage these opportunities. We remain convinced that having a truly global perspective, a diversity of high-performing investment capabilities and product solutions and highly effective ways to bring these capabilities to market is critical. This is what Legg Mason offers. It defines us.
And now let's discuss the quarter and fiscal year. Slide 2 shows the quarterly financial highlights for the company. In brief, my takeaway, we have delivered another solid quarter of financial and strategic improvement, our fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows and reinforce this improvement with the 25% increase in our dividend that I referenced earlier. I am very pleased with this continued progress.
Now Slide 3 shows assets under management at each of our affiliates. As I will discuss more on the next slide, my perspective is simply we have a solid foundation for growth with these affiliates, both in the capabilities and products that they have today and new products we are launching with an active ongoing development pipeline.
Slide 4 provides a snapshot of our affiliates, highlighting their flows and unfunded wins. As I look at our affiliate portfolio, I see 3 broad categories: first, high-quality affiliate franchises, whose investment styles are currently out of favor. Permal and Royce fall into this category. Both are strong franchises and strategically important, and both will be long-term growth stories for Legg Mason. In the case of 
Permal, whose flows were basically flat for the year, the eventual return to a normalized, less correlated market should benefit their business greatly. 
In the case of Royce, which experienced meaningful outflows during the year, the eventual return to a normalized market should reward the high-quality company investment bias for which Royce has long been known.
QS and Martin Currie are in the second affiliate category. Both firms have filled important investment capability gaps for us and have demonstrated excellent short- and long-term prospects. Broadly speaking, we are still in the process of commercializing the investment capabilities of Martin Currie. And while we have experienced some early, small wins together, those of you in the business know product creation work, among vehicles and across jurisdictions, simply takes time. 
As for QS, which will be celebrating its 1 year anniversary with Legg Mason in June, we're beginning to see the power of our global distribution capabilities in tandem with the investment capabilities at QS. As of March 31, QS had $1.5 billion in unfunded wins, underscoring continued strong industry demand for multi-asset class solutions, an early success leveraging our Legg Mason distribution team, specifically within the sub-advisory channel. In April, QS was awarded an additional $2.9 billion sub-advisory mandate, which we'll fund in July. These unfunded wins, now totaling $4.4 billion at QS, are completely incremental to the platform wins that I referenced last quarter. Those platform wins, which start from a small asset base, have the potential for significant asset growth over time.
And finally, our 3 remaining affiliates, Brandywine, ClearBridge and Western, which are the engines of our current growth. Brandywine achieved strong inflows this fiscal year across all their product categories, including fixed income, multi-asset class and equity, and their pipeline remains robust.
Performance at Brandywine is broadly strong in equities and exceptional in fixed income across all time periods and since inception for their strategies. The bottom line for Brandywine is this: They are engaged in very active product development; they are delivering strong investment performance; and they are experiencing meaningful growth momentum in both retail and institutional channels. In fact, 18 of Brandywine's investment strategies, representing 98% of the company's AUM, have been positive net flows for the fiscal year.
Now ClearBridge. Against an industry narrative that has questioned the ability of active managers to deliver alpha, that's a narrative to which we do not subscribe, by the way, investment performance at ClearBridge is strong, particularly in the 3- and 5-year periods. 10 ClearBridge funds have share classes that are rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar, demonstrating the breadth and quality of the ClearBridge product lineup. 16 discrete and differentiated strategies, representing almost 75% of Clearbridge's AUM, have positive net flows for the fiscal year.
Now I'm not sure this is well known or appreciated outside of Legg Mason, but ClearBridge has a remarkably successful history of creating new investment franchises within their business. ClearBridge was among the first movers in 2 categories that today are considered mainstream: Dividend income and MLPs. And today, ClearBridge is expanding both its ESG franchise and continuing the build-out of its institutional business. 
And finally, Western Asset. Western has returned to growth and continues to deliver very strong performance, with more than 90% of strategy AUM outperforming benchmarks in the 3- and 5-year period, a powerful record. That performance has recently earned the company prestigious awards from both Morningstar and Institutional Investor, among others. As a result of Western's investment performance and continued progress on risk management, consultant ratings critical to the institutional business have significantly improved, which is exciting for Western's prospects. Just this past fiscal year, 5 of 15 top consultants upgraded Western, while 7 others raised their outlook. Western's return to positive, long-term flows over the past several quarters reflects the money-in-motion phenomena that we've discussed, but equally important, the strong interest in both their legacy credit strategies and unconstrained and specialized strategies, which we believe positions them very well into the eventuality of a rising rate environment.
Slide 5 shows some of the many awards won by Legg Mason and our affiliates during the year. I'm certainly very proud of my Legg Mason and affiliate colleagues for the hard work and high-quality results that such public recognition represents. Congratulations to all of you.
Slide 6 highlights the significant momentum we've seen this year in Global Distribution. Our record gross and net sales reflect in part the investments we made in Distribution over the last several years, which are now paying off. As pleased as we are with Distribution's performance this past year, we believe that we are positioned to accelerate its performance from here for 3 reasons: our diversification of products, clients and geographies will work for us; our continued investment in distribution will work for us; and our momentum in the marketplace will work for us. 
So let me be a bit more specific. First, the diversification inherent in our business by client type, geography, product and strategy provides us with ample opportunities to grow our business. We are not beholden to or dependent upon a single or small group of products or client channels or geographies. For example, the concentration of our gross sales in the U.S. among our top 3 selling funds is only just over 1/3 of our total sales according to a well-known industry consultant, who has done analytical work for us. This means that almost 2/3 of our mutual fund sales in the U.S. are in products other than from our top 3 selling products. Of the 50 firms of all sizes surveyed by that consultant, 40 have higher concentrations of sales in top 3 products than Legg Mason. Additionally, every 1 of our 6 Global Distribution regions is in positive net flows. And with the exception of Royce, all of our affiliates are in positive net flow within our retail distribution platform. This is exactly the kind of diversification that we intend to build out further.
Second, we've invested in our distribution platform by hiring nearly 50 client-facing staff, whose impact is largely yet to come. We're enhancing our sales team's effectiveness through global sales training, increasing the air cover for them in the field with robust marketing initiatives and creative publicity campaigns and increasing the efficiency of our sales teams by introducing predictive analytics to help pinpoint investor need and opportunity.
And finally, we start the fiscal year with significant momentum in the retail channel globally, with improvement in gross sales of 26% year-over-year, up from 15% growth the previous 2 years. Don't underestimate the power of momentum within a sales organization and in a marketplace with clients. We expect to continue to capitalize on that momentum, reflecting a deep partnership with both our Global Distribution partners and affiliates, which is paying off with a meaningful increase in sales, net flows and market share gains.
Underscoring that momentum, Legg Mason has moved up 11 positions year-over-year to #12 in our quarterly U.S. retail market sales ranking for active funds. And in U.S. taxable fixed income, our share of gross sales has doubled year-over-year, again, according to our industry consultant. In retail SMAs, we are the #2 provider in the industry with $48 billion in assets. 
And finally, our cross-border market share has also increased significantly year-over-year, which we expect to continue as we commercialize products, especially with our newer affiliates. These are all testaments to the investments that we have made, the great work by our teams, and speak directly to why we believe this platform has significant momentum and quite a lot more room to run. 
Slide 7 shows the expansion of our investment capabilities, which, together with our distribution platform, is a key driver of growth. We define the market as having 3 broad opportunity sets in product development: classic active, next-generation active and passive. Traditional, classic active is defined as style box benchmark-oriented strategies that are broadly losing share to passive strategies. Here, we are growing by taking a bigger slice of a shrinking, albeit, enormously large market opportunity. Winning in the classic active space is a take-share game driven by strong investment performance and effective distribution capabilities. We have both. With the exception of some of our small cap strategies, the strength we enjoy in high active share and income products, when combined with strong distribution alpha, is driving robust sales for many of our affiliates.
Now while the classic active products are broadly an outflow within the industry, Next Generation Active Products, such as flexible, alternative and outcome-oriented strategies, are receiving strong investor demand. And we are extremely active in Next Gen product development and distribution. In fact, in just under 3 years, we have more than doubled AUM in Next Gen active products, and we are accelerating that effort. We can continue to expand our list of Next Gen Active Products, both organically and through M&A. As you can see on the slide, building on the 23 products that we launched last year, recall we also, through acquisitions of Martin Currie and QS Investors, added significant, new investment capabilities, which have yet to be fully commercialized into retail products.
And then finally, the passive space. We certainly see an evolution of a market, which has been dominated by cap-weighted index strategies, a commoditized and highly-competitive segment largely driven by price. The evolution in passive strategies is a migration of interest to smart beta strategies, which seek to correct or overcome the limitations associated with pure cap-weighted, indexed products. We have existing smart beta capabilities with QS, and a number of our other managers are also evaluating the strategies against their own investment capabilities. We view smart beta to be an opportunity to compete for flows that have been moving to index products for some time. We also see the continued expansion of the ETF as a compelling investment vehicle for some investors, and therefore, another growth opportunity for Legg Mason. We believe that there are opportunities to use the ETF wrapper to translate our affiliates' investment expertise into innovative products. While this is certainly a multiyear initiative for us, we are extremely excited about the addition of our new ETF team, giving us the potential for extensions of existing products and the creation of new products in ETF wrappers.
Slide 8 shows our investment performance. While the 1-year number dipped a bit, we've seen before that it can bounce around. That said, I'm very pleased to say that performance remains broadly strong across most time periods.
And with that, Pete, now I'll turn it over to you."
180481,291739513,800334,"Legg Mason Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 01, 2015",2015-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 9. As Joe noted, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings with net income of $83 million or $0.73 per share. And this is our first quarter in some time where we have no integration or other initiative costs, so a clean",1355,"Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 9. As Joe noted, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings with net income of $83 million or $0.73 per share. And this is our first quarter in some time where we have no integration or other initiative costs, so a clean quarter that we have all been looking forward to. At a high level, our revenues decreased, primarily due to 2 fewer days in the quarter and lower performance fees. On the expense side, the majority of the decline was related to comp and benefits driven by the reduction in revenues. 
Adjusted income was $118 million for the quarter or $1.03 per share. Average long-term AUM was up a net 1% from the prior quarter, with average fixed income up 2% and equity down 1%.
This quarter's performance fees of $24 million came from a diverse group of our affiliates, specifically Brandywine, Martin Currie, Permal and Western. These were better than forecasted as a result of strong performance at both Brandywine and Martin Currie. While impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
In terms of capital deployment, this quarter, we repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares and ended the fiscal year with only $14 million left on our previous authorization. We have fully deployed that amount in April and are already acting on our new $1 billion authorization, continuing at our usual $90 million quarterly pace subject, as always, to markets and any alternative capital uses.
Moving on to Slide 10. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. This quarter's lower-than-typical rate resulted from true-ups in our final return filings for fiscal '14 as well as changes in our valuation reserves on deferred tax assets due to final income apportionment across our various taxing jurisdictions. These combine to increase our earnings per share by $0.03 this quarter. Next quarter, we are anticipating that our tax rate will be favorably impacted by a recently legislated change in the New York City apportionment rules that will reduce our fiscal Q1 taxes by approximately $10 million to $20 million. Excluding this item, we expect our GAAP tax rate for the full fiscal year to be between 35% and 37%. And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter, we were at 6%. And for next fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 4% to 5%, as you can see on Page 21 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 11. Our assets under management were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by a $15 billion decline in liquidity AUM. This more than offset a 2% increase in long-term AUM and a $2.7 billion favorable market impact in the quarter, which was net of $6.3 billion of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
Long-term flows on Slide 12 were a positive $6.2 billion and represented our fourth straight quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $7.6 billion reflected continued strong performance, combined with high market demand across a variety of our strategies and products. Equity flows were negative, with small cap being the primary driver, while U.S. large cap and income-oriented products continue to generate strong inflows. Looking ahead, our April flows will likely be negative based on what we know at the moment, given they will be impacted by a $1.9 billion redemption at Western that arose from a client diversifying managers and was unrelated to performance.
But as we have said in the past, any 1 month does not make a trend, especially in a lumpy world of institutional flows. And to that point, we are also aware our May flows will benefit from the $1.5 billion of equity wins at QS, which Joe mentioned earlier. Given the higher fees on these equity wins versus the lower fees on the fixed income redemption, the net result of this activity will actually be revenue-accretive. 
Advisory fees on Slide 13 show our average quarterly AUM, along with the advisory fee trend, with this quarter's higher rate primarily reflecting the growth in retail assets at Western and ClearBridge, which were partially offset by the challenges at Royce. 
Operating expenses on Slide 14 decreased by $27 million or 4% to $573 million. 
I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide. But looking at the other line items, D&S expense decreased, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter. Occupancy expense decreased $7 million, as last quarter's number included the QS integration lease charge. Communication and technology expense increased $2 million, reflecting additional cost at affiliates that were offset in compensation and benefits. And finally, other expenses decreased $2 million, as last quarter's expenses included costs related to the Martin Currie acquisition and the disposition of LMIC.
Turning to Slide 15. Salary and incentives decreased by $17 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues resulting from the 2 fewer days in the quarter and lower performance fees. These more than offset the increase in benefits and payroll taxes due to seasonal factors. 
Transition costs and severance decreased, as last quarter included QS integration costs and costs related to the LMIC sale. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 54%, at the higher end of our expected range due to the usual seasonal factors, which will also affect our next fiscal quarter.
Slide 16 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased 23.8% from last quarter's 21.4%.The prior quarter's lower margin was primarily due to the QS integration costs as well as costs related to M&A activity in the quarter. The combination of these factors served to reduce fiscal Q3's operating margin by 3.3%.
Slide 17 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 to this quarter's $0.73 per share. Fiscal Q3 included QS integration costs as well as expenses related to the purchase of Martin Currie and the sale of LMIC. These were partially offset by a reduction in tax reserves and the capital gain on LMIC, all of which combined to reduce last quarter's earnings per share by $0.06.
This quarter, the combination of lower revenues from the 2 fewer days, lower performance fees, seasonally higher benefits and payroll taxes, which were all slightly offset by a lower share count, reduced EPS by $0.05.
Higher mark-to-market on our seed investments increased EPS by $0.02. Also in fiscal Q4, as I previously noted, year-end tax items increased earnings per share by $0.03.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which highlights our quarterly cash position, as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment.
In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 52 million shares or 32% since March 2010. 
In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same time frame. We now have 6 straight years of increased annual dividends, representing virtually a 6-fold increase since 2010. And while not shown here, our rate of returning capital to shareholders, reflecting both our stock buyback program and our regular quarterly dividends, was industry-leading over the last year and has been nearly double the peer average over the past 4 years.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which stands at $670 million as of March 31, up slightly from December 31.
Finally, on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $391 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. This is a $17 million increase from Q3 as we continue to support our new product development efforts.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter for Legg Mason. And as always, we have complemented our growth with a capital deployment strategy that highlights consistent dividends and share repurchases, along with significant investments in growth initiatives, both organically and through acquisition. 
So thanks for your time and your interest in Legg Mason. And now I'll turn it back to Joe."

But when you look at mix, it's really 5 different factors. It's a combination of what affiliates, what products, what asset classes, what geography and what clients. And so I think it was a combination of all of those things that helped to drive the margin. But as we look forward, it's really about growing the bottom line. And so we're focused about bottom line, growing the top line. The margin will be an outcome, but a lot of that, again, is based on the mix.

And after that, we definitely see it falling from where it is today. And long term, it's a bit difficult to predict just because of the -- again, it's heavily dependent on the mix of the affiliates. But for the time being, we see it being in that 53%, 54% range on an annualized basis."

And my views on that are not really any different than they've been for a while. First of all, I think this whole notion -- this whole discussion about transparency, nontransparency, I think the jury is still way out on this. We, to be clear, are far from convinced that transparency is a huge issue for our PMs. In fact, we know for sure with some of our PMs that they have no issue with transparency. But now that said, to be clear, there could be some strategies. There may be some markets where nontransparent ETFs make sense. But I don't think blanket statement saying transparency is a problem. We will disagree with that. Obviously, the adoption of what are now sort of these nontransparent ETFs in the marketplace, it's not been particularly robust. And we're going to continue to monitor and evaluate it, but there's really no rush on our part to get there. What I would -- what we haven't really talked a lot about, Bill, but we're excited about, is obviously, we do think 2 things. We think ETFs -- the broad appetite of ETFs and being able to bring our -- some of our existing strategies into ETFs or create new strategies in the ETF vehicles, clearly, there's demand for that vehicle and that structure. And so obviously, we hired a team during the quarter to really build out that effort for us. And then secondly, the opportunity in smart beta. You kind of referenced smart beta. And we see this as an evolving opportunity to capture flows that have been going into passive. We're excited about both smart beta and the opportunity to commercialize some of our strategies in ETFs. So it's an evolving discussion, we think both of which provide opportunities for growth for us."

So if you think back to the previous quarter of -- we have $7.6 billion of net fixed income flows, but we estimate only $1.1 billion of that was related to the money-in-motion phenomena. Well, that means that $6.5 billion of our fixed income flows for that -- for this previous quarter are what I would consider to be our kind of ongoing organic growth in fixed income. Now if you look back to the December quarter, we had $9.9 billion in fixed income flows, but 2/3 of those were really related to the money in motion. So what -- we see this as a positive. We see this as affirming the fact that our -- we've been building and growing our fixed income business, both retail and institutional, for some time now. So the money-in-motion opportunities are going to be largely institutional going forward, are going to be long and lumpy processes. We think Western and Brandywine are well positioned to grow there from the money in motion, but also, and really maybe more importantly, from their organic growth opportunities. What we're seeing right now broadly in terms of client mix is that we're continuing to get good flows in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S., both in retail and institutional. So if you look back over the last quarter, our fixed income business was split basically 63% or so retail, 37% institutional and then 50-50 U.S. and international. So really nice balance, really nice diversification. We are seeing in the money in motion a lot of that is really what we would call the classic active. A lot of those flows are going into Core and Core Plus because that's kind of a like-for-like, where they're leaving a certain type of strategy and coming to a similar strategy, Core or Core Plus. In the more organic growth that we've been experiencing for some time, more of that is really in the Next Generation Active Products, things like macro ops, global sovereign strategies, absolute return, et cetera, et cetera. So we're really excited about the momentum we have. We still got a lot of -- our pipeline remains fairly robust. We're seeing a lot of opportunities. Again, the institutional piece, going to be long lumpy; the money-in-motion piece, long and lumpy. But we're getting good business, institutional, retail, U.S., international.

Well, money market really didn't have much of an impact on us yet because we need to see a reasonably sizable increase in the -- at the short end of the curve. But I think you guys read the press just as much as we do and follow the Fed. It's certainly a lot closer today around the time frame for that increase. But if you look at what we're doing in that space right now with the impending regulatory interchange, which is 1.5 years off, but nonetheless, clients are very aggressively looking at what they're going to do with their liquidity monies going forward, and that's where Western is spending their time. The key at the end of the day is what kind of products are they looking for. We've already got a pretty good suite of other liquidity-like products, things that are longer duration than 90 days. But still, clients today are using those for liquidity money, where they're willing to give up a stable NAV already and go out a little longer on the duration curve. So we're cautiously optimistic that the combination of factors that include the new bank capital rules, where the banks aren't looking for a significant increases in terms of deposits, that that's a bullish sign for us long term. So a combination of as those rigs come into play and as rates go up, that's going to be a more interesting business for us."

We were actually sitting around, touching yesterday about kind of looking forward from here and how we feel about our flow and our business activity. And I got to tell you, the team feels very, very positive about it. One of the things -- if you think about it, we reported our unfunded pipeline at the end of March of being $7.6 billion. At the end of this month or at the end of April, our unfunded pipeline is $10.1 billion. That's the highest number any of us can remember. I don't know if it's a record or not, but it is the highest any of us can remember. But here's what's interesting. It's almost 60% equity. We've been having very robust activity in the fixed income side, which is terrific, and we still have it. Obviously, 40%, 41% or thereabouts of our kind of April 30 unfunded pipeline. 40% or 41% is fixed income, and that's largely specialized. The good news about that is its higher fee. But on the equity side, almost 60% is in equity, and that's really across the board. That's ClearBridge, that's Martin Currie, that is QS, that is Brandywine. And so we're getting good breadth. So look, we've talked about Royce. Royce has been challenged. They're going to be challenged for a while. We know that. But the diversity of our model with -- between asset classes, and even within asset classes, is pretty powerful. And we're getting a lot of looks in here right now. So we feel pretty good about it."

And again, just due to all the complexity factors in that mix, it's difficult to give you kind of a straight line as to where the margin will go. What we do feel very positive about is the things we can control at the parent level. And as you've heard me say before, roughly 75% of our costs at the parent level are kind of quasi-fixed in nature, so they'll go up without inflation. But we don't need to add a lot of cost to add -- managing a lot of AUM. So there's only about 25% of our cost at the parent level that vary based on the level of sales and levels of AUM, and those are primarily commission-based salespeople, so they pay for themselves. But the other thing to keep in mind, we've had record sales now for the last 2 years coming out of retail Global Distribution. And we eat the full upfront cost of those commissions in the first year. Yes, we keep those assets for 4 to 5 years. So that's another thing that kind of gives us some real bullish sentiment around the margin over the next couple of years because we're not going to -- we're going to have assets and we're raising a lot of several that aren't going to be costing us anything from a commission standpoint. So general, again, cautiously bullish on the margin going up from here. It'll be bumpy just because of all the mix things. But the main underlying pillars are the leverage at the parent and then this persistency of assets that we only pay for once upfront on the retail side. That makes sense?"

If you think about it, the U.S., and I referenced some statistics in my prepared remarks about the improvement in terms of our positioning relative to other fund complexes in terms of sales, I think that's very powerful. We made significant progress this past year. The opportunity in fixed income, particularly in the U.S., remains. Now it's going to be slow, and it's going to be kind of a slow build in organic. But with Western being named Morningstar's Fixed-Income Manager of the Year, well, that gives you a lot of tailwind. If rates rise, which we actually -- we've been talking to people about we're actually looking forward to rates rising because, obviously, that ultimately makes fixed income more attractive. Western -- both Western and Brandywine, we think, perform well or will perform well in a rising rate environment. So we feel well positioned for that. So we think we can continue to capture share in the retail space in fixed income in the U.S. What's exciting for us is, internationally, we've always done a good job and frankly, kind of punched above our weight as it relates to fixed income and even U.S. equities, but we've never really had solutions, manage ball-type things, which is what QS does, or the non-U.S. equity strategies, which, obviously, Martin Currie does. We are seeing some good traction and some good activity with Martin Currie Australia. Now Martin Currie Australia is our legacy Australian equity business that we combined with Martin Currie. That's gone very well. It's been a good combination. We're seeing good traction with Martin Currie Australia, particularly in Asia. But we think we can continue to grow internationally very, very much with many of Martin Currie's strategies once we get them into our cross-border vehicles. So things like Asia long-term unconstrained, European long, short. They've got some strategies that we think are very compelling. They are also very much next-generation strategies. And then we can continue to combine them with our U.S. equity strategies and fixed income, where we are still getting good action internationally.

Thank you, operator. I appreciate it. Look, this morning, I'd like to leave you all with what I consider to be the 5 key takeaways that we believe are critical to understanding Legg Mason and our long-term opportunities.
First, with nearly $17 billion in long-term flows and a 3% organic growth rate, Legg Mason is definitely back in growth mode. And we look forward to building upon that momentum as we bring QS Investors and Martin Currie more fully online while we continue to leverage our legacy affiliate growth engines. 
Secondly, the diversification in our model is a key competitive advantage as our varied affiliates balance one another to the benefit of clients and shareholders over different market cycles.
Third, Legg Mason's Global Distribution platform represents a significant strategic asset for both our affiliates and our shareholders. This year was a record year for Distribution and gross and net sales. And with the exception of Royce, net positive flows across all regions and for all affiliates within LMGD. 
Fourth, we will remain very focused on improving absolute earnings and margin over time by maintaining a rigorous cost discipline, accelerating our organic growth, working to improve our asset mix and by implementing new management equity plans at our affiliates. Each of these actions can be drivers of improved long-term profitability and potential margin expansion.
And finally, we will continue to deploy the significant amount of cash that we generate between investments that expand our investment capabilities and distribution and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So thank you for your time today. I'd like to congratulate my colleagues at Legg Mason and our affiliates for a good quarter and a strong year and thank our shareholders for your continued trust and confidence. We look forward to rewarding your investment in Legg Mason again over the next year. And with that, I wish you all a wonderful day and weekend."

But before we start this morning, I'd like to thank the many of you who have reached out to us with expressions of support and offers to help during these difficult days for Baltimore. It has meant a great deal to me personally and to all of Legg Mason to know that during such challenging times, our industry colleagues see the bigger picture and focus on the most important issues. I want you to know that while what has happened in our city has been profoundly disturbing, we believe in Baltimore and are committed to joining with the city to work through our challenges and come through this better and stronger. Baltimore is a strong, tough town that will heal and will get better, and we intend to stand shoulder to shoulder to help make that happen. Again, please accept my deep appreciation for your concern and your support.
So as we enter our new fiscal year energized by significant progress and clear growth momentum and significant opportunities to address the meaningful challenges our clients face, I'm proud to say that the company has largely delivered on the key strategic initiatives that we've outlined over the past few years. And this positions us to grow in the short term while strengthening our foundation for the long term.
Over the past couple of years, we have tightened up our cost structure and improved our operating efficiency while significantly modifying our affiliate portfolio to better leverage our global distribution platform. We've expanded our lineup of client-relevant products, invested further in our global distribution platform, significantly improved our capital structure, and we've achieved all of this while leading the industry in our rate of returning capital to shareholders. 
And I'm pleased to report that we have declared a dividend of $0.20 per share, up 25% over last year. And perhaps most importantly, we have returned to organic growth, generating nearly $17 billion in positive long-term flows in actively managed products. We have achieved this flow turnaround at a time when industry-active managed strategies have been challenged, due in large part to high correlations across most asset classes.
In my closing remarks this morning, I will highlight 5 key takeaways that we believe are critical to understanding Legg Mason today and our broader strategy for tomorrow. But for now, suffice it to say that I believe Legg Mason to be in the early innings of a compelling, long-term growth story.
Our return to positive long-term flows underscores the power of our multi-affiliate model. It is the diversity of our offerings that best serves the needs of our investor clients. That same diversity of investment capabilities of clients, geography and affiliates will deliver for our shareholders with multiple sources of growth and across a wide range of revenue streams.
Our clients face many challenges globally, including persistently low interest rates, volatility in the commodity and currency markets and global geopolitical turmoil. These and other factors have impacted economic activity and the potential for earnings growth. However, we believe these are macro trends that can offer thoughtful investors substantial opportunity.
Around the world, demographic factors, combined with lower economic growth rates, especially in developed countries, are creating challenges for governments, businesses and retirement systems as more individuals move toward retirement. The significant need for and demand for both growth and income solutions is an enduring global phenomena that we can help solve. Even amidst many current challenges, we see investment opportunities expanding dramatically across multiple asset classes and sectors, including energy, technology, biotech and infrastructure, among others. Therefore, it's an exciting time for those who can identify and manage these opportunities. We remain convinced that having a truly global perspective, a diversity of high-performing investment capabilities and product solutions and highly effective ways to bring these capabilities to market is critical. This is what Legg Mason offers. It defines us.
And now let's discuss the quarter and fiscal year. Slide 2 shows the quarterly financial highlights for the company. In brief, my takeaway, we have delivered another solid quarter of financial and strategic improvement, our fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows and reinforced this improvement with the 25% increase in our dividend that I referenced earlier. I am very pleased with this continued progress.
Now Slide 3 shows assets under management at each of our affiliates. As I will discuss more on the next slide, my perspective is simply we have a solid foundation for growth with these affiliates, both in the capabilities and products that they have today and new products we are launching with an active ongoing development pipeline.
Slide 4 provides a snapshot of our affiliates, highlighting their flows and unfunded wins. As I look at our affiliate portfolio, I see 3 broad categories: first, high-quality affiliate franchises, whose investment styles are currently out of favor. Permal and Royce fall into this category. Both are strong franchises and strategically important, and both will be long-term growth stories for Legg Mason. In the case of Permal, whose flows were basically flat for the year, the eventual return to a normalized, less correlated market should benefit their business greatly. 
In the case of Royce, which experienced meaningful outflows during the year, the eventual return to a normalized market should reward the high-quality company investment bias for which Royce has long been known.
QS and Martin Currie are in the second affiliate category. Both firms have filled important investment capability gaps for us and have demonstrated excellent short- and long-term prospects. Broadly speaking, we are still in the process of commercializing the investment capabilities of Martin Currie. And while we have experienced some early, small wins together, those of you in the business know product creation work, among vehicles and across jurisdictions, simply takes time. 
As for QS, which will be celebrating its 1 year anniversary with Legg Mason in June, we're beginning to see the power of our global distribution capabilities in tandem with the investment capabilities at QS. As of March 31, QS had $1.5 billion in unfunded wins, underscoring continued strong industry demand for multi-asset class solutions, an early success leveraging our Legg Mason distribution team, specifically within the sub-advisory channel. In April, QS was awarded an additional $2.9 billion sub-advisory mandate, which we'll fund in July. These unfunded wins, now totaling $4.4 billion at QS, are completely incremental to the platform wins that I referenced last quarter. Those platform wins, which start from a small asset base, have the potential for significant asset growth over time.
And finally, our 3 remaining affiliates, Brandywine, ClearBridge and Western, which are the engines of our current growth. Brandywine achieved strong inflows this fiscal year across all their product categories, including fixed income, multi-asset class and equity, and their pipeline remains robust.
Performance at Brandywine is broadly strong in equities and exceptional in fixed income across all time periods and since inception for their strategies. The bottom line for Brandywine is this: They are engaged in very active product development; they are delivering strong investment performance; and they are experiencing meaningful growth momentum in both retail and institutional channels. In fact, 18 of Brandywine's investment strategies, representing 98% of the company's AUM, have been positive net flows for the fiscal year.
Now ClearBridge. Against an industry narrative that has questioned the ability of active managers to deliver alpha, that's a narrative to which we do not subscribe, by the way, investment performance at ClearBridge is strong, particularly in the 3- and 5-year periods. 10 ClearBridge funds have share classes that are rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar, demonstrating the breadth and quality of the ClearBridge product lineup. 16 discrete and differentiated strategies, representing almost 75% of Clearbridge's AUM, have positive net flows for the fiscal year.
Now I'm not sure this is well known or appreciated outside of Legg Mason, but ClearBridge has a remarkably successful history of creating new investment franchises within their business. ClearBridge was among the first movers in 2 categories that today are considered mainstream: Dividend income and MLPs. And today, ClearBridge is expanding both its ESG franchise and continuing the build-out of its institutional business. 
And finally, Western Asset. Western has returned to growth and continues to deliver very strong performance, with more than 90% of strategy AUM outperforming benchmarks in the 3- and 5-year period, a powerful record. That performance has recently earned the company prestigious awards from both Morningstar and Institutional Investor, among others. As a result of Western's investment performance and continued progress on risk management, consultant ratings critical to the institutional business have significantly improved, which is exciting for Western's prospects. Just this past fiscal year, 5 of 15 top consultants upgraded Western, while 7 others raised their outlook. Western's return to positive, long-term flows over the past several quarters reflects the money-in-motion phenomena that we've discussed, but equally important, the strong interest in both their legacy credit strategies and unconstrained and specialized strategies, which we believe positions them very well into the eventuality of a rising rate environment.
Slide 5 shows some of the many awards won by Legg Mason and our affiliates during the year. I'm certainly very proud of my Legg Mason and affiliate colleagues for the hard work and high-quality results that such public recognition represents. Congratulations to all of you.
Slide 6 highlights the significant momentum we've seen this year in Global Distribution. Our record gross and net sales reflect in part the investments we made in Distribution over the last several years, which are now paying off. As pleased as we are with Distribution's performance this past year, we believe that we are positioned to accelerate its performance from here for 3 reasons: our diversification of products, clients and geographies will work for us; our continued investment in distribution will work for us; and our momentum in the marketplace will work for us. 
So let me be a bit more specific. First, the diversification inherent in our business by client type, geography, product and strategy provides us with ample opportunities to grow our business. We are not beholden to or dependent upon a single or small group of products or client channels or geographies. For example, the concentration of our gross sales in the U.S. among our top 3 selling funds is only just over 1/3 of our total sales according to a well-known industry consultant, who has done analytical work for us. This means that almost 2/3 of our mutual fund sales in the U.S. are in products other than from our top 3 selling products. Of the 50 firms of all sizes surveyed by that consultant, 40 have higher concentrations of sales in top 3 products than Legg Mason. Additionally, every 1 of our 6 Global Distribution regions is in positive net flows. And with the exception of Royce, all of our affiliates are in positive net flow within our retail distribution platform. This is exactly the kind of diversification that we intend to build out further.
Second, we've invested in our distribution platform by hiring nearly 50 client-facing staff, whose impact is largely yet to come. We're enhancing our sales team's effectiveness through global sales training, increasing the air cover for them in the field with robust marketing initiatives and creative publicity campaigns and increasing the efficiency of our sales teams by introducing predictive analytics to help pinpoint investor need and opportunity.
And finally, we start the fiscal year with significant momentum in the retail channel globally, with improvement in gross sales of 26% year-over-year, up from 15% growth the previous 2 years. Don't underestimate the power of momentum within a sales organization and in a marketplace with clients. We expect to continue to capitalize on that momentum, reflecting a deep partnership with both our Global Distribution partners and affiliates, which is paying off with a meaningful increase in sales, net flows and market share gains.
Underscoring that momentum, Legg Mason has moved up 11 positions year-over-year to #12 in our quarterly U.S. retail market sales ranking for active funds. And in U.S. taxable fixed income, our share of gross sales has doubled year-over-year, again, according to our industry consultant. In retail SMAs, we are the #2 provider in the industry with $48 billion in assets. 
And finally, our cross-border market share has also increased significantly year-over-year, which we expect to continue as we commercialize products, especially with our newer affiliates. These are all testaments to the investments that we have made, the great work by our teams, and speak directly to why we believe this platform has significant momentum and quite a lot more room to run. 
Slide 7 shows the expansion of our investment capabilities, which, together with our distribution platform, is a key driver of growth. We define the market as having 3 broad opportunity sets in product development: classic active, next-generation active and passive. Traditional, classic active is defined as style box benchmark-oriented strategies that are broadly losing share to passive strategies. Here, we are growing by taking a bigger slice of a shrinking, albeit, enormously large market opportunity. Winning in the classic active space is a take-share game driven by strong investment performance and effective distribution capabilities. We have both. With the exception of some of our small cap strategies, the strength we enjoy in high active share and income products, when combined with strong distribution alpha, is driving robust sales for many of our affiliates.
Now while the classic active products are broadly an outflow within the industry, Next Generation Active Products, such as flexible, alternative and outcome-oriented strategies, are receiving strong investor demand. And we are extremely active in Next Gen product development and distribution. In fact, in just under 3 years, we have more than doubled AUM in Next Gen active products, and we are accelerating that effort. We can continue to expand our list of Next Gen Active Products, both organically and through M&A. As you can see on the slide, building on the 23 products that we launched last year, recall we also, through acquisitions of Martin Currie and QS Investors, added significant, new investment capabilities, which have yet to be fully commercialized into retail products.
And then finally, the passive space. We certainly see an evolution of a market, which has been dominated by cap-weighted index strategies, a commoditized and highly-competitive segment largely driven by price. The evolution in passive strategies is a migration of interest to smart beta strategies, which seek to correct or overcome the limitations associated with pure cap-weighted, indexed products. We have existing smart beta capabilities with QS, and a number of our other managers are also evaluating the strategies against their own investment capabilities. We view smart beta to be an opportunity to compete for flows that have been moving to index products for some time. We also see the continued expansion of the ETF as a compelling investment vehicle for some investors, and therefore, another growth opportunity for Legg Mason. We believe that there are opportunities to use the ETF wrapper to translate our affiliates' investment expertise into innovative products. While this is certainly a multiyear initiative for us, we are extremely excited about the addition of our new ETF team, giving us the potential for extensions of existing products and the creation of new products in ETF wrappers.
Slide 8 shows our investment performance. While the 1-year number dipped a bit, we've seen before that it can bounce around. That said, I'm very pleased to say that performance remains broadly strong across most time periods.
And with that, Pete, now I'll turn it over to you."

As Joe noted, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings with net income of $83 million or $0.73 per share. And this is our first quarter in some time where we have no integration or other initiative costs, so a clean quarter that we have all been looking forward to. At a high level, our revenues decreased, primarily due to 2 fewer days in the quarter and lower performance fees. On the expense side, the majority of the decline was related to comp and benefits driven by the reduction in revenues. 
Adjusted income was $118 million for the quarter or $1.03 per share. Average long-term AUM was up a net 1% from the prior quarter, with average fixed income up 2% and equity down 1%.
This quarter's performance fees of $24 million came from a diverse group of our affiliates, specifically Brandywine, Martin Currie, Permal and Western. These were better than forecasted as a result of strong performance at both Brandywine and Martin Currie. While impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
In terms of capital deployment, this quarter, we repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares and ended the fiscal year with only $14 million left on our previous authorization. We have fully deployed that amount in April and are already acting on our new $1 billion authorization, continuing at our usual $90 million quarterly pace subject, as always, to markets and any alternative capital uses.
Moving on to Slide 10. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. This quarter's lower-than-typical rate resulted from true-ups in our final return filings for fiscal '14 as well as changes in our valuation reserves on deferred tax assets due to final income apportionment across our various taxing jurisdictions. These combine to increase our earnings per share by $0.03 this quarter. Next quarter, we are anticipating that our tax rate will be favorably impacted by a recently legislated change in the New York City apportionment rules that will reduce our fiscal Q1 taxes by approximately $10 million to $20 million. Excluding this item, we expect our GAAP tax rate for the full fiscal year to be between 35% and 37%. And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter, we were at 6%. And for next fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 4% to 5%, as you can see on Page 21 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 11. Our assets under management were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by a $15 billion decline in liquidity AUM. This more than offset a 2% increase in long-term AUM and a $2.7 billion favorable market impact in the quarter, which was net of $6.3 billion of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
Long-term flows on Slide 12 were a positive $6.2 billion and represented our fourth straight quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $7.6 billion reflected continued strong performance, combined with high market demand across a variety of our strategies and products. Equity flows were negative, with small cap being the primary driver, while U.S. large cap and income-oriented products continue to generate strong inflows. Looking ahead, our April flows will likely be negative based on what we know at the moment, given they will be impacted by a $1.9 billion redemption at Western that arose from a client diversifying managers and was unrelated to performance.
But as we have said in the past, any 1 month does not make a trend, especially in a lumpy world of institutional flows. And to that point, we are also aware our May flows will benefit from the $1.5 billion of equity wins at QS, which Joe mentioned earlier. Given the higher fees on these equity wins versus the lower fees on the fixed income redemption, the net result of this activity will actually be revenue-accretive. 
Advisory fees on Slide 13 show our average quarterly AUM, along with the advisory fee trend, with this quarter's higher rate primarily reflecting the growth in retail assets at Western and ClearBridge, which were partially offset by the challenges at Royce. 
Operating expenses on Slide 14 decreased by $27 million or 4% to $573 million. 
I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide. But looking at the other line items, D&S expense decreased, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter. Occupancy expense decreased $7 million, as last quarter's number included the QS integration lease charge. Communication and technology expense increased $2 million, reflecting additional cost at affiliates that were offset in compensation and benefits. And finally, other expenses decreased $2 million, as last quarter's expenses included costs related to the Martin Currie acquisition and the disposition of LMIC.
Turning to Slide 15. Salary and incentives decreased by $17 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues resulting from the 2 fewer days in the quarter and lower performance fees. These more than offset the increase in benefits and payroll taxes due to seasonal factors. 
Transition costs and severance decreased, as last quarter included QS integration costs and costs related to the LMIC sale. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 54%, at the higher end of our expected range due to the usual seasonal factors, which will also affect our next fiscal quarter.
Slide 16 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased 23.8% from last quarter's 21.4%.The prior quarter's lower margin was primarily due to the QS integration costs as well as costs related to M&A activity in the quarter. The combination of these factors served to reduce fiscal Q3's operating margin by 3.3%.
Slide 17 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 to this quarter's $0.73 per share. Fiscal Q3 included QS integration costs as well as expenses related to the purchase of Martin Currie and the sale of LMIC. These were partially offset by a reduction in tax reserves and the capital gain on LMIC, all of which combined to reduce last quarter's earnings per share by $0.06.
This quarter, the combination of lower revenues from the 2 fewer days, lower performance fees, seasonally higher benefits and payroll taxes, which were all slightly offset by a lower share count, reduced EPS by $0.05.
Higher mark-to-market on our seed investments increased EPS by $0.02. Also in fiscal Q4, as I previously noted, year-end tax items increased earnings per share by $0.03.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which highlights our quarterly cash position, as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment.
In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 52 million shares or 32% since March 2010. 
In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same time frame. We now have 6 straight years of increased annual dividends, representing virtually a 6-fold increase since 2010. And while not shown here, our rate of returning capital to shareholders, reflecting both our stock buyback program and our regular quarterly dividends, was industry-leading over the last year and has been nearly double the peer average over the past 4 years.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which stands at $670 million as of March 31, up slightly from December 31.
Finally, on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $391 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. This is a $17 million increase from Q3 as we continue to support our new product development efforts.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter for Legg Mason. And as always, we have complemented our growth with a capital deployment strategy that highlights consistent dividends and share repurchases, along with significant investments in growth initiatives, both organically and through acquisition. 
So thanks for your time and your interest in Legg Mason. And now I'll turn it back to Joe."

And then also, the tight cost controls that the parent have dropped a long term and kind of ranged for us in more the 53%, 54% range. And as you indicated, we'll have another quarter -- or partial quarter of seasonal costs, which will kind of work their way through in the June quarter. And after that, we definitely see it falling from where it is today. And long term, it's a bit difficult to predict just because of the -- again, it's heavily dependent on the mix of the affiliates. But for the time being, we see it being in that 53%, 54% range on an annualized basis."

And my views on that are not really any different than they've been for a while. First of all, I think this whole notion -- this whole discussion about transparency, non transparency, I think the jury is still way out on this. We, to be clear, are far from convinced that transparency is a huge issue for our PMs. In fact, we know for sure with some of our PMs that they have no issue with transparency. But now that said, to be clear, there could be some strategies. There may be some markets where nontransparent ETFs make sense. But I don't think blanket statement saying transparency is a problem. We will disagree with that. Obviously, the adoption of what are now sort of these nontransparent ETFs in the marketplace, it's not been particularly robust. And we're going to continue to monitor and evaluate it, but there's really no rush on our part to get there. What I would -- what we haven't really talked a lot about, Bill, but we're excited about, is obviously, we do think 2 things. We think ETFs -- the broad appetite of ETFs and being able to bring our -- some of our existing strategies into ETFs or create new strategies in the ETF vehicles, clearly, there's demand for that vehicle and that structure. And so obviously, we hired a team during the quarter to really build out that effort for us. And then secondly, the opportunity in smart beta. You kind of referenced smart beta. And we see this as an evolving opportunity to capture flows that have been going into passive. We're excited about both smart beta and the opportunity to commercialize some of our strategies in ETFs. So it's an evolving discussion, we think both of which provide opportunities for growth for us."

So if you think back to the previous quarter of -- we have $7.6 billion of net fixed income flows, but we estimate only $1.1 billion of that was related to the money-in-motion phenomena. Well, that means that $6.5 billion of our fixed income flows for that -- for this previous quarter are what I would consider to be our kind of ongoing organic growth in fixed income. Now if you look back to the December quarter, we had $9.9 billion in fixed income flows, but 2/3 of those were really related to the money in motion. So what -- we see this as a positive. We see this as affirming the fact that our -- we've been building and growing our fixed income business, both retail and institutional, for some time now. So the money-in-motion opportunities are going to be largely institutional going forward, are going to be long and lumpy processes. We think Western and Brandywine are well positioned to grow there from the money in motion, but also, and really maybe more importantly, from their organic growth opportunities. What we're seeing right now broadly in terms of client mix is that we're continuing to get good flows in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S., both in retail and institutional. So if you look back over the last quarter, our fixed income business was split basically 63% or so retail, 37% institutional and then 50-50 U.S. and international. So really nice balance, really nice diversification. We are seeing in the money in motion a lot of that is really what we would call the classic active. A lot of those flows are going into Core and Core Plus because that's kind of a like-for-like, where they're leaving a certain type of strategy and coming to a similar strategy, Core or Core Plus. In the more organic growth that we've been experiencing for some time, more of that is really in the Next Generation Active Products, things like macro ops, global sovereign strategies, absolute return, et cetera, et cetera. So we're really excited about the momentum we have. We still got a lot of -- our pipeline remains fairly robust. We're seeing a lot of opportunities. Again, the institutional piece, going to be long lumpy; the money-in-motion piece, long and lumpy. But we're getting good business, institutional, retail, U.S., international.

Well, money market really didn't have much of an impact on us yet because we need to see a reasonably sizable increase in the -- at the short end of the curve. But I think you guys read the press just as much as we do and follow the Fed. It's certainly a lot closer today around the time frame for that increase. But if you look at what we're doing in that space right now with the impending regulatory change, which is 1.5 years off, but nonetheless, clients are very aggressively looking at what they're going to do with their liquidity monies going forward, and that's where Western is spending their time. The key at the end of the day is what kind of products are they looking for. We've already got a pretty good suite of other liquidity-like products, things that are longer duration than 90 days. But still, clients today are using those for liquidity money, where they're willing to give up a stable NAV already and go out a little longer on the duration curve. So we're cautiously optimistic that the combination of factors that include the new bank capital rules, where the banks aren't looking for a significant increases in terms of deposits, that that's a bullish sign for us long term. So a combination of as those regs come into play and as rates go up, that's going to be a more interesting business for us."

We were actually sitting around, talking yesterday about kind of looking forward from here and how we feel about our flow and our business activity. And I got to tell you, the team feels very, very positive about it. One of the things -- if you think about it, we reported our unfunded pipeline at the end of March of being $7.6 billion. At the end of this month or at the end of April, our unfunded pipeline is $10.1 billion. That's the highest number any of us can remember. I don't know if it's a record or not, but it is the highest any of us can remember. But here's what's interesting. It's almost 60% equity. We've been having very robust activity in the fixed income side, which is terrific, and we still have it. Obviously, 40%, 41% or thereabouts of our kind of April 30 unfunded pipeline. 40% or 41% is fixed income, and that's largely specialized. The good news about that is it's higher fee. But on the equity side, almost 60% is in equity, and that's really across the board. That's ClearBridge, that's Martin Currie, that is QS, that is Brandywine. And so we're getting good breadth. So look, we've talked about Royce. Royce has been challenged. They're going to be challenged for a while. We know that. But the diversity of our model with -- between asset classes, and even within asset classes, is pretty powerful. And we're getting a lot of looks in here right now. So we feel pretty good about it."

And again, just due to all the complexity factors in that mix, it's difficult to give you kind of a straight line as to where the margin will go. What we do feel very positive about is the things we can control at the parent level. And as you've heard me say before, roughly 75% of our costs at the parent level are kind of quasi-fixed in nature, so they'll go up by inflation. But we don't need to add a lot of cost to add -- managing a lot of AUM. So there's only about 25% of our cost at the parent level that vary based on the level of sales and levels of AUM, and those are primarily commission-based salespeople, so they pay for themselves. But the other thing to keep in mind, we've had record sales now for the last 2 years coming out of retail Global Distribution. And we eat the full upfront cost of those commissions in the first year. Yet we keep those assets for 4 to 5 years. So that's another thing that kind of gives us some real bullish sentiment around the margin over the next couple of years because we're not going to -- we're going to have assets that we raise in the last several that aren't going to be costing us anything from a commission standpoint. So general, again, cautiously bullish on the margin going up from here. It'll be bumpy just because of all the mix things. But the main underlying pillars are the leverage at the parent and then this persistency of assets that we only pay for once upfront on the retail side. That makes sense?"

If you think about it, the U.S., and I referenced some statistics in my prepared remarks about the improvement in terms of our positioning relative to other fund complexes in terms of sales, I think that's very powerful. We made significant progress this past year. The opportunity in fixed income, particularly in the U.S., remains. Now it's going to be slow, and it's going to be kind of a slow build in organic. But with Western being named Morningstar's Fixed-Income Manager of the Year, well, that gives you a lot of tailwind. If rates rise, which we actually -- we've been talking to people about we're actually looking forward to rates rising because, obviously, that ultimately makes fixed income more attractive. Western -- both Western and Brandywine, we think, perform well or will perform well in a rising rate environment. So we feel well positioned for that. So we think we can continue to capture share in the retail space in fixed income in the U.S. What's exciting for us is, internationally, we've always done a good job and frankly, kind of punched above our weight as it relates to fixed income and even U.S. equities, but we've never really had solutions, manage ball-type things, which is what QS does, or the non-U.S. equity strategies, which, obviously, Martin Currie does. We are seeing some good traction and some good activity with Martin Currie Australia. Now Martin Currie Australia is our legacy Australian equity business that we combined with Martin Currie. That's gone very well. It's been a good combination. We're seeing good traction with Martin Currie Australia, particularly in Asia. But we think we can continue to grow internationally very, very much with many of Martin Currie's strategies once we get them into our cross-border vehicles. So things like Asia long-term unconstrained, European long, short. They've got some strategies that we think are very compelling. They are also very much next-generation strategies. And then we can continue to combine them with our U.S. equity strategies in fixed income, where we are still getting good action internationally.

Thank you, operator. I appreciate it. Look, this morning, I'd like to leave you all with what I consider to be the 5 key takeaways that we believe are critical to understanding Legg Mason and our long-term opportunities.
First, with nearly $17 billion in long-term flows and a 3% organic growth rate, Legg Mason is definitely back in growth mode. And we look forward to building upon that momentum as we bring QS Investors and Martin Currie more fully online while we continue to leverage our legacy affiliate growth engines. 
Secondly, the diversification in our model is a key competitive advantage as our varied affiliates balance one another to the benefit of clients and shareholders over different market cycles.
Third, Legg Mason's Global Distribution platform represents a significant strategic asset for both our affiliates and our shareholders. This year was a record year for Distribution and gross and net sales. And with the exception of Royce, net positive flows across all regions and for all affiliates within LMGD. 
Fourth, we will remain very focused on improving absolute earnings and margin over time by maintaining a rigorous cost discipline, accelerating our organic growth, working to improve our asset mix and by implementing new management equity plans at our affiliates. Each of these actions can be drivers of improved long-term profitability and potential margin expansion.
And finally, we will continue to deploy the significant amount of cash that we generate between investments that expand our investment capabilities in distribution and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So thank you for your time today.

We recorded o",1816,"Thank you, Alan. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Legg Mason. 
I am pleased to report that Legg Mason delivered solid financial performance for the quarter and continued to make strategic progress against our longer-term goals. We recorded our fifth straight quarter of net long-term inflows driven by Western Asset, Brandywine Global, QS investors and Martin Currie. Revenues grew modestly and our bottom line included the effect of seasonal deferred compensation expense, which Pete will walk you through in more detail. 
Our unfunded wins totaling $12 billion at quarter's end, some of which has funded in July, were also strong underscoring the diversification of our business mix across asset class, client type and geography. 
As you all know, this has been a challenging time for the markets for our investors and by extension, our industry.  Investors are inundated with headlines and financial programs that highlight a multitude of issues that they're dealing with today including high equity valuations globally, the implications of rising rates as well as broad geopolitical uncertainty.
On a daily basis, they are trying to navigate such complex issues as a potential Greece default, China slowdown, and market volatility as well as terrorism, none of which inspire confidence, particularly for retail investors. Such consternation has caused investors to pause, which is evidenced by quarterly industry flow data, most notably the $49 billion in outflows in active U.S. equity funds and $6 billion in active U.S. bond fund outflows during the quarter. 
I am pleased to report, however, $1.3 billion in net inflows for the quarter, driven by fixed income. This is especially gratifying given the market and industry headwinds that I just described.
We continue to be very pleased with the success we are experiencing with QS Investors. We're encouraged by the early traction at Martin Currie, particularly in Australia, and we are quite excited by the recent announcement of our acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, which will expand our capabilities in liquid alternatives, specifically listed infrastructure, which we project to be long-term high-growth investment space. Again, all in all a solid quarter against a backdrop of a challenging environment. 
Now, let me walk you through some of the details.
Slide 2 highlights our financial results. We generated net income of $94.5 million or $0.84 per diluted share. And ended the quarter with assets under management of just under $700 billion and as I mentioned, with long-term net inflows of $1.3 billion.
Global Distribution recorded gross and net sales of $19 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and we retired 1.7 million shares during the quarter.
Slide 3 shows our assets under management by affiliate. I'll go into more detail on the next slide. However, I continue to be very pleased with the diversification across our affiliate portfolio and in particular, how our affiliates are differentiated distribution channels and varied geographic mix can balance each other across market cycles. And now, with the announced acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, combined with continued product development across new and legacy affiliates, we will be even more diversified as we grow the business.
Slide 4 shows fund flows and unfunded wins at quarter end by affiliates. Again, it is here where you can see the impact of our business diversity. Let's start with fixed income flows. 
We continue to believe that Legg Mason is well positioned even as interest rates rise, and in fact, as I've said too many of you, we firmly believe that higher normalized rates will ultimately be good for our fixed income business. If you recall in previous rising rate cycles, corporate credit and strategic income strategies, both strengths of our fixed income affiliates, actually saw meaningful inflows. We also see institutional investors rebalancing and increasing their allocations to fixed income broadly and to LDI strategies in particular in a higher rate environment.
Western Asset achieved $1 billion in net long-term inflows during the quarter with 8 of the largest 10 new counts driven by specialized mandates. Western's quarter end 1 but not yet funded pipeline stood at $2.3 billion. While retail fixed income flows have slowed a bit nearly 90% of Webster's AUM is institutional, which tends to be longer term in nature. Western is delivering strong performance broadly across assets and consistent experience momentum with consultants, both of which bode well for the growth of their institutional business. 
Fixed income inflows at Brandywine Global were $1.7 billion reflecting strong flows in both separate accounts and cross-border funds. $2 billion of Brandywine's 1 but not yet funded pipeline is in fixed income with just over $1 billion having funded this month. Finally, Brandywine's institutional sales pipeline continues to look very robust.
Now on to equities.
Inflows at QS Investors, Brandywine and Martin Currie were offset by outflows at Royce and ClearBridge as weakness in the U.S. equity markets accelerated retail outflows. After 9 consecutive quarters of inflows, ClearBridge had net outflows of $800 million driven primarily by a slowing of retail sales and reallocation sub-advisory accounts, which are often seasonal in nature.
Royce experienced outflows again in the quarter and as we've said for a while now, returning to sustained net inflows will take some time.
Now I've spent a good amount of time with Royce and can say with conviction name that we continue to believe in their long-term investment process and are very supportive of the steps that they've taken to strengthen their investment platform in the meantime.
QS Investors recorded $1.7 billion in net inflows and $3.4 billion in unfunded wins at quarter end driven by the sub-advisory takeover wins that we've discussed on previous calls. Approximately $3 billion of those wins have funded in July. QS is a significant component of our new product development with 9 additional products expected to be launched this year. We are very energized by the strong partnership between QS, our product teams and Global Distribution and we continue to see grade long-term potential for continued growth.
Brandywine had net inflows of $400 million in equities and $3 billion of their total unfunded wins are across a number of their equity products. With strong investment performance, these products are seeing robust institutional interest.
Martin Currie had $100 million of inflows and ended the quarter with $500 million in unfunded wins. Martin Currie has enjoyed early momentum with real asset strategies managed by their Australian team, while we continue to integrate their products at and commercialize their strategies across our global distribution platform.
And finally, alternatives. Permal's flows were negative for the quarter so that doesn't really tell the entire story. Our reported AUM number for Permal does not include strong inflows into an Assets Under Advisement product in China, which was nearly $800 million for the quarter. While classified as Assets Under Advisement, this product has attractive fee characteristics, which while lower than Permal's typical retail or institutional fees, are still quite compelling. China continues to be a significant strategic opportunity and we're very encouraged by Permal's progress there.
As a reminder, nearly 70% of Permal's AUM is institutional currently as they continue to transition their business away from the European high network market. Broader, U.S. retail for Permal continues to slowly build momentum with products any more shelf space and intermediaries and we are just now launching a cross-border version of Permal's liquid alternative strategies that we believe will attract strong interest.
We announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire RARE Infrastructure, a firm with very attractive products and performance in global listed infrastructure, which is consistent with our strategy of acquiring you a differentiated investment capability that can be leveraged through our global distribution platform. So this is actually good segue to spend a minute on this acquisition.
Let's start on Slide 5 with why this transaction is so compelling. Infrastructure, as an asset class, is very applicable to many investor objectives, specifically growth, income and capital preservation. These are global investment themes that we are addressing through ongoing product development in outcome oriented products and through M&A, such as this transaction. The listed infrastructure space is growing quickly and yet, the opportunity is still developing, which gives us the opportunity to be a market leader in a rapidly growing area.
We believe base supply of listed infrastructure investment opportunities should continue to expand as governments modernize and upgrade infrastructure. At the same time, fiscal constraints will compel governments across the globe to increasingly access the private sector to finance these projects. 
RARE is a market leader in listed infrastructure funds, particularly in Australia and Canada markets that have been early adopters of this asset class. Their investment team has an excellent long-term track record with performance that consistently beats of their stated return objectives.
RARE offers a broad suite of products in both developing and emerging markets and has seen assets double the past 3 years, which highlights the potential of this business as we leverage it with our global retail distribution platform and introduce and market their products in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Obviously, we have developed a high degree of confidence in the RARE team. These are infrastructure professionals who now manage funds, not fund managers who have decided to create infrastructure products. Further, the founders have done a great job building a strong bench of investment talent and leadership under them.
As is always critical, we have come to appreciate RARE's culture and how well it will fit within Legg Mason, smart people, talented people, good people.
Finally, this is Legg Mason's first transaction where we are leaving founder equity within the affiliate by purchasing less than 100% of the company. As we've discussed on previous earnings call, we believe management equity is essential to optimizing long-term alignment. 
Slide 6 shows the performance of Legg Mason's global distribution platform for the quarter, which I would once again, characterize as solid.
Gross sales of $19 billion, while down from last quarter, were up 17% from the same quarter last year. The drop in gross sales, when combined with some of the sub-advisory reallocations in the quarter, contributed to a drop in net sales although distribution was still net positive inflows overall. Additionally, our investment in distribution is starting to bear fruit with a 65% increase in gross sales from certain previously undercovered advisers in the U.S.
And finally, we continue to work closely with the SEC to obtain all the necessary approvals to offer strategies in an ETF wrapper and we look forward to be able to provide more color with respect to our ETF plans in the near future.
Slide 7 shows our performance in the critical 3- and 5-year window across our strategy AUM and our long-term U.S. fund average.
Performance at a few of our affiliates dipped a bit in this quarter largely impacted by energy prices and emerging markets weakness. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Pete. Pete?"
180481,307265505,844030,"Legg Mason Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll pick up on Slide 8.

Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report continued long-term inflows along with earnings of $95 million or $0.84 per share for the quarter. 
At a high level, our revenues increased primarily due to an additional day in the quarter and a 1% increase in average long-term AUM, which more than offset lower performance fees. At the same time, our earnings benefited from some one-time tax items mainly related to New York City tax code changes, which collectively contributed approximately $18 million or $0.16 per share to our quarterly results.
On the expense side, as we indicated on our last call, the increase from the prior quarter was a result of higher seasonal compensation expenses. This increase was somewhat elevated from the prior year seasonal impacts due to accounting charges related to a slightly higher number of retirement eligible employees receiving annual deferred compensation awards. 
Additionally, this quarter was impacted by severance packages for several highly compensated employees. 
Adjusted income was $129 million for the quarter or $1.14 per share. This quarter's performance fees of $19 million came from Permal, Brandywine and Western. These were at the higher end of our expectations as a result of strong performance particularly at Permal and Brandywine. While impossible to predict with precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
In terms of capital deployment this quarter, we again retired $90 million in shares. In addition, 1 million shares of stock were granted as part of our annual incentive compensation, so our weighted average shares were reduced by approximately 400,000.
Moving on to Slide 9, the only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 21%. This quarter's rate is lower than normal resulting largely from the New York City tax changes that I mentioned earlier. The tax outlook for next quarter is a return to a GAAP effective rate of approximately 36%.
And as we've consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP cap rate. Specifically, for this quarter we were at 6% and for the full fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 5%, as you can see on page 20 in the appendix. This lower cash rate is anticipated to last at least through the end of this decade based on our current estimates.
Turning to Slide 10, our Assets Under Management were down 1% compared to the prior quarter driven by market depreciation of $7 billion. This more than offset positive net long-term and liquidity flows.
On slide 11, you can see the long-term inflows were $1.3 billion and represented our fifth straight quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $2.6 billion reflected our strong performance in areas of market demand across a variety of strategies and products. Equity flows were negative though small cap being a primary driver. 
Looking ahead, our July flows will be positive based on what we know at the moment driven by equity wins including a large custom asset allocation mandate and a variety of institutional fixed income wins, although we anticipate these will be partially offset by the ongoing redemptions at Royce.
You will see on slide 12, that we're disclosing our total operating revenue yield ex performance fees. We feel this view is a more helpful depiction of our revenue yield trends and will help you more accurately model our revenues going forward. This quarter's higher rate was primarily due to the growth in average long-term AUM along with a decline in average lower fee liquidity AUM.
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased by $11 million or 2% to $584 million. I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items, DNS expense increased reflecting 1 additional day in the quarter along with cost related emerging certain fund raises in Europe. Also I want to highlight for this quarter, we expect DNS expense to remain at the 22% level we saw in the June quarter. 
Other expenses decreased $5 million as the prior quarter's expenses included higher advertising and consulting spend. 
Turning to Slide 14, compensation and benefits increased by $12 million, while benefits and payroll taxes were up $17 million largely due to the increase in seasonal cost. $7 million of that increase was affiliate related and thus, offset and salary and incentives. Additionally, the seasonal cost included $9 million of incremental accounting charges related to annual deferred compensation awards to retirement eligible employees. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 56%, higher than our full year expected range due to these seasonal factors. We do expect this ratio to drop back down to the 53% to 54% range for the remainder of fiscal 2016.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which decreased from last quarter's 23.8%. The incremental impact of the retirement eligible accounting charges on the current quarter's operating margin was 1.7%, so we expect our margin to improve next quarter as these costs abate.
Slide 16 is a roll forward from fiscal Q4's GAAP earnings per share of $0.73 to this quarter's $0.84 per share. Fiscal Q4 was a pretty clean quarter only impacted by a lower tax rate, which increased last quarter's earnings per share by $0.03.
This quarter, higher revenues were offset by the seasonally higher benefit cost, which combined to reduce earnings per share by a penny. The change in mark-to-market on our seed investments decreased earnings per share also by a penny. And finally, for fiscal Q1, as I previously noted, that's changes increased earnings per share by $0.16.
I'll wrap up on Slide 17, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 53 million shares or 32% since March 2010. While in the upper right, we have highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same timeframe. We now have 6 straight years of increased annual dividends and we're particularly proud of that magnitude of those increases since 2010, which is approaching 600%.
And as you can see, in total, we returned a very robust $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the last 5 years, a rate of return that is industry-leading.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which has been relatively consistent over the past year. As expected, our cash balance is at its typical seasonal low point for the year due to cash bonuses paid in mid-May.
Finally on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $328 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. This is a $63 million decrease from fiscal Q4 as we were able to redeem some of our seed investments from products that no longer required capital support. 
So thank you for your time and for your interest in Legg Mason. Now, I'll turn it back over to Joe."

Legg Mason has a truly global perspective, capability set and footprint, which guides us in delivering products that address and solve the increasingly complex needs of investors. 
I want to emphasize once again that we are well positioned in fixed income even with a potential U.S. interest rate hike on the horizon. With nearly 90% of our fixed income business institutional in nature, we believe that demand from investors will remain strong particularly for the credit, absolute return, global and unconstrained products in which Brandywine and Western Asset have long track records and excellent performance.
We continue to believe strongly in active management in fixed income and the data clearly shows that core, active fixed income managers have consistently and meaningfully beaten their benchmarks over time. This fact reflects the flawed construction of fixed income indices and the diversity of investment opportunity to active managers. And we believe our active fixed income managers have demonstrated, time and again, that they are among the best in the business.
Obviously, a rising rate environment will also make our money market offerings more attractive and we believe that Western is well positioned after evolving their product set to capture opportunities as regulatory reform is implemented.
We don't often talk about this, but rising interest rates and the more normalized economic and market environment that they represent should also provide opportunity for our active equity managers, particularly Permal and Royce, whose investments styles have been out of favor in this persistently and abnormally low rate environment. 
We continue to fill product gaps and strengthen and diversify our affiliate portfolio. We are very pleased with the initial work to commercialize the investment capabilities that QS Investors and Martin Currie have brought to us. The momentum that QS Investors is showing particularly in the insurance sub-advisory space is very encouraging.
The progress that our ETF team has made in building an infrastructure to offer strategies in an ETF wrapper is also very exciting. As I mentioned, we are working diligently with the SEC and look forward to providing an update after necessary approvals are obtained.
The pending acquisition of RARE Infrastructure will bring a highly regarded, deeply experienced team with a focus on d liquid alternative asset class that has significant opportunity to grow. 
And finally, Legg Mason continues to deliver organic growth and we believe our pipeline represents significant opportunity to capture assets across an increasingly diversified affiliate portfolio. Our unfunded wins and pipeline are diverse highlighting the strong performance of client-relevant products across our affiliates. As we continue to bring these products to market and engage the advisers who partner with us, we expect to continue to further capture market share globally. 
And finally, as we execute against our strategic business plans, we intend to optimize shareholder returns through buybacks and growing our dividend over time. 
And now, we look forward to taking your questions."

In a matter of fact, they are the largest they are in the listed mutual funds space. If you look data in Australia, their value in their EM funds comprise about 39% of that market and in Canada, the sub-advised fund, which is basically a clone of fund, has about 45% market share. And so, from me that's kind of 2 main things that come out of that. First, I think it's a testament to the quality of the franchise and the credibility of the team and certainly the performance of the products. But secondly, it really points to the LMGD opportunity that we have in partnering with RARE. They have spent very little time and energy and effort looking to grow their business in the U.S. and in Europe and in Asia and certainly if you know on our LMGD platform, that's where we're very well positioned. So we will look to continue to leverage some of their existing UCITS programs into the cross-border space. We'll probably be increased the registrations there.

They're continuing to build and grow their direct consultant driven institutional business, the business that they had prior to our acquisition. We're also -- we've also been working with them sort of on a number of retail fronts as we've talked about to get them on platforms and to be able to begin to accrue ongoing kind of consistent flows. We're seeing that happen. That's slow. Those are not takeover wins. Those are just position is that allow for you to get flows over time. And then through the insurance sub-advised space, that's really where we've had pretty quick success with them in terms of, in some cases, topping up existing strategies frankly that came from our Batterymarch platform but the larger takeover wins really are more aligned with multi-asset class type allocation strategies. And we just see continued demand for that. Their pipeline of interest and activity is very, very strong. We are, as I think I mentioned on -- in my remarks, we've also got a significant pipeline of product development. They've got 9 different products right now in the pipeline looking to come forward, so that's really an reflection of the highly customize multi-asset class, multiple allocation strategies that they do. As for Brandywine, it's just -- it's a breadth of very high-quality traditional products. They've got some good large-cap products as well as some good more -- what am I trying to say? Next-generation products and things like that. It's just that -- it's nothing particularly unique.

If you reca",537,"So, great question, Mike. Well, I think a couple of things. First of all, to be candid, yes, I think we actually outperformed -- when you see a combination much as we did with QS, and acquisition -- any acquisition but then also a combination. If you recall, we combined Batterymarch with QS. And whenever you see something like that, you expect that that sort of gives clients an opportunity to rethink and potentially to redeem. We retained much more of the Batterymarch and QS assets through the first year of transition than we expected. So we were pleased with the retention of existing business post acquisition. We've also been and to be perfectly candid with you, surprised at the strength of flows and business with QS. But when you step back and think about it, QS is in the sweet spot right now. We're virtually every type of client that we talked to is interested in talking about and considering customized strategies. And our -- and QS' ability to be able to do that, to be able to understand the needs of the client and then customize a strategy either using ETFs or using some of our managers or some combination of the 2 is really quite compelling. As far as what are we doing differently or better, I just think we're doing a good job of execution. I think, many -- our pipeline, our M&A pipeline is as robust as it's ever been. I think that's a function of the environment. I think it's tougher for smaller managers right now. We know that costs are rising. Fees -- there's pressure on fees, so it's a tough environment for many managers and when they look out there, the ability to joined a firm to retain their investment independence, to retain their operational autonomy, to be able to tap in to this global distribution platform, which I think QS and Martin Currie already, their eyes are wide open with the power and strength of that platform, and then in some cases, some choose to tap into various of our other shared services to realize operational efficiency, that's a pretty good combination. And so, we've just -- I think we're attracting a lot of interest right now and I got to get credit to our distribution teams and our product teams and all of our shared service what we call the value chain of Legg Mason for really executing well and delivering. Now some of those steps just takes time. it takes time, as Tom mentioned and I've talked about before, to get things through the pipe in terms of product creation and the regulatory hurdles and all that kind of stuff. But in the meantime, particularly as it relates to the sub-advisory capability, which is really was Quasi-institutional, we can get moving on that pretty much right away. So I think it's -- we've got an attractive model. We find the right partners. It's got to be the right chemistry and the right culture and then so our business model is drawing them. We have the right culture, we what we believe to be the right culture going in and then I think it's been good execution."

Their growth, their CAGR in terms of AUM, revenues are running higher than 20%, so we don't see any reason why they should slow down. There any market that has $2 trillion worth of securities that can be invested in. So they've got -- there's no constraint in terms of size. And we'd expect them to continue to grow given normal markets. The only other thing in terms of rev share, and keep in mind, we don't disclose rev shares for each affiliate for obvious competitive reasons, but that'll be better than what our average is in.

In the U.S., that size of the market today is only about $16 billion and maybe half of that, $8 billion in Europe.

We're -- specifically, the opportunity I mentioned with respect to China was Permal. That is a strategy that was launched in 2014 with a large Chinese financial institution with whom we enjoy a nice distribution relationship. Importantly, the fund that Permal manages has performed relatively well through all of the turbulence that we've seen in the China markets. And as a result, that strategy we saw -- I think we mentioned about $800 million in flows into the strategy just in the last quarter. The strategy now has a total of about $1.5 billion. I would say that as it relates to sort of the attractiveness of that business, it's a lower fee rate than what their traditional institutional or retail fees would be, but they have opportunities. It's still an attractive management fee and they do have opportunities for incentive fees associated with it. As part is how it extends beyond just Permal I mean I can't give you of what the growth rate could be, it could be significant, a good -- those flows can be a bit volatile, to be candid with you. We're about it. It bodes well for Permal. But those can be volatile so we can't really predict what they will be. But what I'll tell you is that all of our affiliates really are in dialogue with Legg Mason, with our Global Distribution platform in terms of how can we extend the success at Permal and with this distributor into other products and then to other channels in China. That's fast it's a market. It's a difficult market to penetrate. We do cover it currently. We do not have a retail distribution office in China. We cover that or have our Hong Kong office responsible for that.

So recall, we always highlight an uptick in compensation in the first 2 calendar quarters every year. But as you're talking about specifics, I can walk through that. In the March quarter, that's only social fact",339,"Sure. There was. I appreciate the question. So recall, we always highlight an uptick in compensation in the first 2 calendar quarters every year. But as you're talking about specifics, I can walk through that. In the March quarter, that's only social factors kind of resetting as well as 401k matches and profit-sharing. Then in the June quarter, all those factors continue up until the point we pay bonuses and at that stage, high earners all kind of get above the limits for those programs. But the other thing we had going on in the June quarter is that's also when we make our annual equity and deferred compensation awards. And as I mentioned on the call, there's retirement people get within 4 years of our normal retirement age, which is the to, GAAP accounting requires you to kind of short even though the lesson. So 4 years and people can vest after they've hypothetically reword so we have good levers to complete, don't solicit. But the accounting rules changed a number of years ago on that. If you're say 59, you now get a 3-year service period even though legally vaguely, it's a four-year period. So that had any impact in the quarter of about $0.05. This year, it about a $0.02 impact after, so we have it every year. It was just a little bit elevated this year. We had a few high earners that hit it. But is basically just accounting noise. It's accelerating the expense be taken away. And it's basically no impact in terms of cash from or no impact to our cash bottom line earnings. And as I think from the most what is being for everyone on the call is we expect next quarter to drop back to the 53%, 54% that we've been guiding to and blended average by the time we get to the end of the year will be by the end of 53%, 54% visit our current projections. Is that when it's a big Saudi does that help?"

In the broader kind",341,"Well, look, first of all, they capture probably -- their market waited -- first of all, they're market-weighted much like the equity indexes. So the biggest issuers and to be -- have the highest percentage capture in the index itself. In the broader kind of the Barclays AG, which everybody uses and is kind of the main benchmark in the index, I think it's only 35% -- of the eligible securities in fixed income, only 35% are captured within that index. So that tells you that there's a whole world out there, 2/3, 2 times as many securities and asset classes within fixed income that can be used and in fact, active managers do use to kind of position their portfolio for different types of market environments. As you can imagine, given what's happened with the U.S. government over the last really since the crises, the massive increase that we've seen a government issuance, treasuries are included in that index. So consequently, given that it's a market cap weighted index, the U.S. Treasury component of it has been significantly -- has significantly increased. So that really allows for active managers who have the flexibility to go beyond that 35% of available products and strategies in fixed income to outperform governments and spread products, and credit products, and unconstrained types of securities have the potential to significantly outperform treasuries. So the index itself is no much more treasury our government -- U.S. government security related than it was even before the crisis because of the massive issuance of the government. The fact that -- look, it's different certainly, in equities, but on the fixed income side, roughly 70% of all active income managers beat the benchmark. Some of them like us like Brandywine and Western, beat it big time. But even the kind of average median fixed income manager can be, it's just not that hard. So for people that are going to the index, we think they're making a choice to underperform over time, at least underperform their opportunity, for sure."

I am pleased to report that Legg Mason delivered solid financial performance for the quarter and continued to make strategic progress against our longer-term goals. We recorded our",1822,"Thank you, Alan. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Legg Mason. I am pleased to report that Legg Mason delivered solid financial performance for the quarter and continued to make strategic progress against our longer-term goals. We recorded our fifth straight quarter of net long-term inflows driven by Western Asset, Brandywine Global, QS investors and Martin Currie. Revenues grew modestly and our bottom line included the effect of seasonal deferred compensation expense, which Pete will walk you through in more detail. Our unfunded wins totaling $12 billion at quarter's end, some of which has funded in July, were also strong, underscoring the diversification of our business mix across asset class, client type and geography. 
As you all know, this has been a challenging time for the markets for our investors and by extension, our industry. Investors are inundated with headlines and financial programs that highlight a multitude of issues that they are dealing with today, including high equity valuations globally, the implications of rising rates as well as broad geopolitical uncertainty. On a daily basis, they are trying to navigate such complex issues as a potential Greece default, China's slowdown and market volatility as well as terrorism, none of which inspire confidence, particularly for retail investors. Such consternation has caused investors to pause, which is evidenced by quarterly industry flow data, most notably the $49 billion in outflows in active U.S. equity funds and $6 billion in active U.S. bond fund outflows during the quarter. I am pleased to report, however, $1.3 billion in net inflows for the quarter, driven by fixed income. This is especially gratifying given the market and industry headwinds that I just described. 
We continue to be very pleased with the success we are experiencing with QS Investors. We're encouraged by the early traction at Martin Currie, particularly in Australia, and we are quite excited by the recent announcement of our acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, which will expand our capabilities in liquid alternatives, specifically listed infrastructure, which we project to be a long-term, high-growth investment space. Again all in all, a solid quarter against a backdrop of a challenging environment. 
Now let me walk you through some of the details. Slide 2 highlights our financial results. We generated net income of $94.5 million or $0.84 per diluted share and ended the quarter with Assets Under Management of just under $700 billion, and as I mentioned, with long-term net inflows of $1.3 billion. Global Distribution recorded gross and net sales of $19 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and we retired 1.7 million shares during the quarter.
Slide 3 shows our Assets Under Management by affiliate. I'll go into more detail on the next slide. However, I continue to be very pleased with the diversification across our affiliate portfolio and in particular, how our affiliates, our differentiated distribution channels and varied geographic mix can balance one another across market cycles. And now with the announced acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, combined with continued product development across new and legacy affiliates, we will be even more diversified as we grow the business.
Slide 4 shows fund flows and unfunded wins at quarter end by affiliate. Again it is here where you can see the impact of our business diversity. Let's start with fixed income flows. We continue to believe that Legg Mason is well positioned even as interest rates rise. And in fact, as I've said to many of you, we firmly believe that higher normalized rates will ultimately be good for our fixed income business. If you recall in previous rising rate cycles, corporate credit and strategic income strategies, both strengths of our fixed income affiliates, actually saw meaningful inflows. We also see institutional investors rebalancing and increasing their allocations to fixed income broadly and to LDI strategies in particular in a higher rate environment.
Western Asset achieved $1 billion in net long-term inflows during the quarter with 8 of the largest 10 new accounts driven by specialized mandates. Western's quarter-end won but not yet funded pipeline stood at $2.3 billion. While retail fixed income flows have slowed a bit, nearly 90% of Western's AUM is institutional, which tends to be longer term in nature. Western is delivering strong performance broadly across their composites and continues to experience momentum with consultants, both of which bode well for the growth of their institutional business. 
Fixed income inflows at Brandywine Global were $1.7 billion, reflecting strong institutional flows in both separate accounts and cross-border funds. $2 billion of Brandywine's won but not yet funded pipeline is in fixed income with just over $1 billion having funded this month. Finally, Brandywine's institutional sales pipeline continues to look very robust.
Now on to equities. Inflows at QS Investors, Brandywine and Martin Currie were offset by outflows at Royce and ClearBridge as weakness in the U.S. equity markets accelerated retail outflows. After 9 consecutive quarters of inflows, ClearBridge had net outflows of $800 million driven primarily by a slowing of retail sales and reallocations in sub-advisory accounts, which are often seasonal in nature.
Royce experienced outflows again in the quarter. And as we've said for a while now, returning to sustained net inflows will take some time. Now I've spent a good amount of time with Royce and can say with conviction that we continue to believe in their long-term investment process and are very supportive of the steps that they've taken to strengthen their investment platform in the meantime.
QS Investors recorded $1.7 billion in net inflows and $3.4 billion in unfunded wins at quarter end, driven by the sub-advisory takeover wins that we've discussed on previous calls. Approximately $3 billion of those wins have funded in July. QS is a significant component of our new product development with 9 additional products expected to be launched this year. We are very energized by the strong partnership between QS, our product teams and Global Distribution, and we continue to see great long-term potential for continued growth.
Brandywine had net inflows of $400 million in equities and $3 billion of their total unfunded wins are across a number of their equity products. With strong investment performance, these products are seeing robust institutional interest. Martin Currie had $100 million of inflows and ended the quarter with $500 million in unfunded wins. Martin Currie has enjoyed early momentum with real asset strategies managed by their Australian team while we continue to integrate their product set and commercialize their strategies across our Global Distribution platform.
And finally, alternatives. Permal's flows were negative for the quarter so that doesn't really tell the entire story. Our reported AUM number for Permal does not include strong inflows into an Assets Under Advisement product in China, which was nearly $800 million for the quarter. While classified as Assets Under Advisement, this product has attractive fee characteristics, which while lower than Permal's typical retail or institutional fees are still quite compelling. China continues to be a significant strategic opportunity, and we're very encouraged by Permal's progress there. As a reminder, nearly 70% of Permal's AUM is institutional currently as they continue to transition their business away from the European high net worth market. Broader U.S. retail for Permal continues to slowly build momentum with products gaining more shelf space at intermediaries and we are just now launching a cross-border version of Permal's liquid alternative strategies that we believe will attract strong interest.
We announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire RARE Infrastructure, a firm with very attractive products and performance in global listed infrastructure, which is consistent with our strategy of acquiring new and differentiated investment capability that can be leveraged through our Global Distribution platform. So this is actually good segue to spend a minute on this acquisition.
Let's start on Slide 5 with why this transaction is so compelling. Infrastructure as an asset class is very applicable to many investor objectives, specifically growth, income and capital preservation. These are global investment themes that we are addressing through ongoing product development in outcome-oriented products and through M&A, such as this transaction. The listed infrastructure space is growing quickly, and yet the opportunity is still developing, which gives us the opportunity to be a market leader in a rapidly growing area. We believe base supply of listed infrastructure investment opportunities should continue to expand as governments modernize and upgrade infrastructure. At the same time, fiscal constraints will compel governments across the globe to increasingly access the private sector to finance these projects. 
RARE is a market leader in listed infrastructure funds, particularly in Australia and Canada markets that have been early adopters of this asset class. Their investment team has an excellent long-term track record with performance that consistently beats of their stated return objectives. RARE offers a broad suite of products in both developing and emerging markets and has seen assets double the past 3 years, which highlights the potential of this business as we leverage it with our global retail distribution platform and introduce and market their products in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Obviously, we have developed a high degree of confidence in the RARE team. These are infrastructure professionals who now manage funds, not fund managers who have decided to create infrastructure products. Further, the founders have done a great job building a strong bench of investment talent and leadership under them. As is always critical, we have come to appreciate RARE's unique culture and how well it will fit within Legg Mason: smart people, talented people, good people. Finally, this is Legg Mason's first transaction, where we are leaving founder equity within the affiliate by purchasing less than 100% of the company. As we've discussed on previous earnings call, we believe management equity is essential to optimizing long-term alignment. 
Slide 6 shows the performance of Legg Mason's Global Distribution platform for the quarter, which I would once again characterize as solid. Gross sales of $19 billion, while down from last quarter, were up 17% from the same quarter last year. The drop in gross sales, when combined with some of the sub-advisory reallocations in the quarter, contributed to a drop in net sales, although distribution was still net positive in flows overall. Additionally, our investment in distribution is starting to bear fruit with a 65% increase in gross sales from certain previously undercovered advisers in the U.S. And finally, we continue to work closely with the SEC to obtain all the necessary approvals to offer strategies in an ETF wrapper. And we look forward to be able to provide more color with respect to our ETF plans in the near future.
Slide 7 shows our performance in the critical 3- and 5-year window across our strategy AUM and our long-term U.S. fund average. Performance at a few of our affiliates dipped a bit in this quarter largely impacted by energy prices and emerging markets weakness. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Pete. Pete?"

Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report continued long-term inflows along with earnings of $95 million or $0.84 per share for the quarter. At a high level, our revenues increased",1185,"Thanks, Joe. I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report continued long-term inflows along with earnings of $95 million or $0.84 per share for the quarter. At a high level, our revenues increased primarily due to an additional day in the quarter and a 1% increase in average long-term AUM, which more than offset lower performance fees. At the same time, our earnings benefited from some onetime tax items, mainly related to New York City tax code changes, which collectively contributed approximately $18 million or $0.16 per share to our quarterly results.
On the expense side, as we indicated on our last call, the increase from the prior quarter was a result of higher seasonal compensation expenses. This increase was somewhat elevated from the prior year seasonal impacts due to accounting charges related to a slightly higher number of retirement-eligible employees receiving annual deferred compensation awards. Additionally, this quarter was impacted by severance packages for several highly compensated employees. 
Adjusted income was $129 million for the quarter or $1.14 per share. This quarter's performance fees of $19 million came from Permal, Brandywine and Western. These were at the higher end of our expectations as a result of strong performance, particularly at Permal and Brandywine. While impossible to predict with precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. In terms of capital deployment this quarter, we again retired $90 million in shares. In addition, 1 million shares of restricted stock were granted as part of our annual incentive compensation, so our weighted average shares were reduced by approximately 400,000.
Moving on to Slide 9. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 21%. This quarter's rate is lower than normal resulting largely from the New York City tax changes that I mentioned earlier. The tax outlook for next quarter is a return to a GAAP effective rate of approximately 36%. And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically, for this quarter, we were at 6%. And for the full fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 5%, as you can see on Page 20 in the appendix. This lower cash rate is anticipated to last at least through the end of this decade based on our current estimates.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Assets Under Management were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven by market depreciation of $7 billion. This more than offset positive net long-term and liquidity flows.
On Slide 11, you can see the long-term inflows were $1.3 billion and represented our fifth straight quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $2.6 billion reflected our strong performance in areas of market demand across a variety of strategies and products. Equity flows were negative with small cap being the primary driver. Looking ahead, our July flows will be positive based on what we know at the moment, driven by equity wins, including a large custom asset allocation mandate and a variety of institutional fixed income wins, although we anticipate these will be partially offset by the ongoing redemptions at Royce.
You will see on Slide 12 that we are disclosing our total operating revenue yield ex performance fees. We feel this view is a more helpful depiction of our revenue yield trends and will help you more accurately model our revenues going forward. This quarter's higher rate was primarily due to the growth in average long-term AUM, along with a decline in average lower fee liquidity AUM.
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased by $11 million or 2% to $584 million. I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide. But looking at the other line items, D&S expense increased, reflecting 1 additional day in the quarter along with cost related to merging certain fund ranges in Europe. Also I wanted to highlight for quarter, we expect D&S expense to remain at the 22% level we saw in the June quarter. Other expenses decreased $5 million as the prior quarter's expenses included higher advertising and consulting spend. 
Turning to Slide 14. Compensation and benefits increased by $12 million while benefits and payroll taxes were up $17 million, largely due to the increase in seasonal costs. $7 million of that increase was affiliate related, and thus offset in salary and incentives. Additionally, the seasonal costs included $9 million of incremental accounting charges related to annual deferred compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 56%, higher than our full year expected range due to these seasonal factors. We do expect this ratio to drop back down to the 53% to 54% range for the remainder of fiscal 2016.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which decreased from last quarter's 23.8%. The incremental impact of the retirement-eligible accounting charges on the current quarter's operating margin was 1.7%. So we expect our margin to improve next quarter as these costs abate.
Slide 16 is a roll-forward from fiscal Q4's GAAP earnings per share of $0.73 to this quarter's $0.84 per share. Fiscal Q4 was a pretty clean quarter, only impacted by a lower tax rate, which increased last quarter's earnings per share by $0.03. This quarter, higher revenues were offset by the seasonally higher benefit cost, which combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.01. The change in mark-to-market on our seed investments decreased earnings per share also by $0.01. And finally, for fiscal Q1, as I previously noted, tax changes increased earnings per share by $0.16.
I'll wrap up on Slide 17, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 53 million shares or 32% since March 2010, while in the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same timeframe. We now have 6 straight years of increased annual dividends, and we are particularly proud of the magnitude of those increases since 2010, which is approaching 600%. And as you can see, in total, we have returned a very robust $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the last 5 years, a rate of return that is industry-leading.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which has been relatively consistent over the past year. As expected, our cash balance is at its typical seasonal low point for the year due to cash bonuses paid in mid-May. Finally on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $328 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. This is a $63 million decrease from fiscal Q4 as we were able to redeem some of our seed investments from products that no longer required capital support. 
So thank you for your time and for your interest in Legg Mason. Now I'll turn it back over to Joe."

I want to emphasize once again that we are well positioned in",483,"Thanks, Pete. Legg Mason has a truly global perspective, capability set and footprint, which guides us in delivering products that address and solve the increasingly complex needs of investors. I want to emphasize once again that we are well positioned in fixed income even with a potential U.S. interest rate hike on the horizon. 
With nearly 90% of our fixed income business institutional in nature, we believe that demand from investors will remain strong, particularly for the credit, absolute return, global and unconstrained products in which Brandywine and Western Asset have long track records and excellent performance. We continue to believe strongly in active management in fixed income and the data clearly shows that core active fixed income managers have consistently and meaningfully beaten their benchmarks over time. This fact reflects the flawed construction of fixed income indices and the diversity of investment opportunity to active managers. And we believe our active fixed income managers have demonstrated time and again that they are among the best in the business. 
Obviously, a rising rate environment will also make our money market offerings more attractive and we believe that Western is well positioned after evolving their product set to capture opportunities as regulatory reform is implemented. We don't often talk about this, but rising interest rates and the more normalized economic and market environment that they represent should also provide opportunity for our active equity managers, particularly Permal and Royce, whose investment styles have been out of favor in this persistently and abnormally low rate environment. 
We continue to fill product gaps and strengthen and diversify our affiliate portfolio. We are very pleased with the initial work to commercialize the investment capabilities that QS Investors and Martin Currie have brought to us. The momentum that QS Investors is showing, particularly in the insurance sub-advisory space, is very encouraging. The progress that our ETF team has made in building an infrastructure to offer strategies in an ETF wrapper is also very exciting. As I mentioned, we are working diligently with the SEC and look forward to providing an update after necessary approvals are obtained. The pending acquisition of RARE Infrastructure will bring a highly regarded, deeply experienced team with a focus on a liquid alternative asset class that has significant opportunity to grow. 
And finally, Legg Mason continues to deliver organic growth. And we believe our pipeline represents significant opportunity to capture assets across an increasingly diversified affiliate portfolio. Our unfunded wins and pipeline are diverse, highlighting the strong performance of client-relevant products across our affiliates. As we continue to bring these products to market and engage the advisers who partner with us, we expect to continue to further capture market share globally. And finally, as we execute against our strategic business plans, we intend to optimize shareholder returns through buybacks and growing our dividend over time. 
And now we look forward to taking your questions."

Matter of fact, they are the largest player in the listed mutual fund space there. If you look Morningstar data in Australia, their value in their EM funds comprise about 39% of that market. And in Canada, the sub-advised fund, which is basically a clone of their flagship fund, has about 45% market share. And so for me, there's kind of 2 main things that come out of that. First, I think it's a testament to the quality of the franchise and the credibility of the team and certainly the performance of the products. But secondly, it really points to the LMGD opportunity that we have in partnering with RARE. They have spent very little time and energy and effort looking to grow their business in the U.S. and in Europe and in Asia. And certainly if you know our LMGD platform, that's where we're very well positioned. So we will look to continue to leverage some of their existing UCITS programs into the cross-border space. We'll probably increase the registrations there. The U.S., we'll have to create some new vehicles. But we think in the near term, we can access the insurance sub-advisory space and our multi-asset class solutions."

We've talked about that. But if and as we see the need for nontransparent ETF activities, we'll continue to consider what available vehicles are ultimately best for our clients. As a reminder, we are one of the largest providers of retail SMAs in the business. So we've long been accustomed to a greater degree of transparency. One of the great opportunities we do see, however, is the evolution of what many call smart beta. And we see that as an opportunity to evolve the passive market beyond kind of the traditional market cap weighted strategies by using different factor-based strategies that really better reflect client objectives. These types of products, these smart beta types of products maybe best offered in an ETF vehicle, so we want to be prepared to be able to do that.

We're also -- we've also been working with them sort of on a number of retail fronts, as we've talked about, to get them on platforms and to be able to begin to accrue ongoing kind of consistent flows. We're seeing that happen. That's slow. Those are not takeover wins. Those are just positionings that allow for you to get flows over time. And then through the insurance sub-advised space, that's really where we've had pretty quick success with them in terms of -- in some cases, topping up existing strategies frankly that came from our old Batterymarch platform. But the larger takeover wins really are more aligned with multi-asset class-type allocation strategies. And we just see continued demand for that. Their pipeline of interest and activity is very, very strong. We are -- as I think I mentioned in my remarks, we've also got a significant pipeline of product development. They've got 9 different products right now in the pipeline looking to come forward. So that's really a reflection of the interest in the highly customized multi-asset class, multiple allocation strategies that they do. As for Brandywine, it's just -- it's a breadth of very high-quality traditional products. They've got some good large-cap products as well as some good, more -- what am I trying to say? Next-generation products and things like that. It's just -- it's nothing particularly unique.

First of all, to be candid, yes, I think we actually outperformed -- when you see a combination much as we did with QS, an acquisition -- any acquisition but then also a combination, if you recall",535,"So great question, Mike. Look, I think a couple of things. First of all, to be candid, yes, I think we actually outperformed -- when you see a combination much as we did with QS, an acquisition -- any acquisition but then also a combination, if you recall, we combined Batterymarch with QS. And whenever you see something like that, you expect that, that sort of gives clients an opportunity to rethink and potentially to redeem. We retained much more of the Batterymarch and QS assets through the first year of transition than we expected. So we were pleased with the retention of existing business post acquisition. We've also been, and to be perfectly candid with you, surprised at the strength of flows and business with QS. But when you step back and think about it, QS is in the sweet spot right now. Virtually every type of client that we talk to is interested in talking about and considering customized strategies. And our -- and QS's ability to be able to do that, to really be able to understand the needs of the client, and then customize a strategy either using ETFs or using some of our managers or some combination of the 2 is really quite compelling. As far as what are we doing differently or better, I just think we're doing a good job of execution. I think many -- our pipeline, our M&A pipeline is as robust as it's ever been. I think that's a function of the environment. I think it's tougher for smaller managers right now. We know that costs are rising. Fees, there's pressure on fees. So it's a tough environment for many managers. And when they look out there, the ability to join a firm to retain their investment independence, to retain their operational autonomy, to be able to tap into this Global Distribution platform, which I think QS and Martin Currie, already their eyes are wide open with the power and strength of that platform. And then in some cases, some choose to tap into various of our other shared services to realize operational efficiency. That's a pretty good combination. And so we've just -- I think we're attracting a lot of interest right now. And I've got to give credit to our distribution teams and our product teams and all of our shared service, what we call the value chain of Legg Mason, for really executing well and delivering. Now some of the stuff just takes time. It takes time, as Tom mentioned and I've talked about before, to get things through the pipe in terms of product creation and the regulatory hurdles and all that kind of stuff. But in the meantime, particularly as it relates to this insurance sub-advisory capability, which is really quasi-institutional, we can get moving on that pretty much right away. So I think it's -- we've got an attractive model. We find the right partners. It's got to be the right chemistry and the right culture. And then -- so our business model is drawing them. We have a right culture, what we believe to be the right culture going in, and then I think it's been good execution."

Their growth, their CAGR in terms of AUM, revenues are running higher than 20%. So we don't see any reason why that should slow down. They're at a market that has $2 trillion worth of securities that can be invested in. So they've got -- there's no constraint in terms of size.

The only other thing -- and in terms of rev share, and keep in mind, we don't disclose specific rev shares for each affiliate for obvious competitive reasons.

And if you look at that league table of competitors here, you see mostly specialists. And so for us, we think it's the opportunity to partner with a leader in a space that's not only growing rapidly but has a lot more room to run. In the U.S., that size of the market today is only about $16 billion and maybe half of that, $8 billion, in Europe. And as we mentioned earlier, the focus coming out of our partnership with LMGD on this will be those 2 markets. And so I can't predict future growth rates, but we think the sector is growing, we have a leader and we have the ability through the distribution team to continue to really take advantage of some of those growth rates in what are almost effectively new markets for RARE."

Specifically, the opportunity I mentioned with respect to China was Permal. That is a strategy that was launched in 2014 with a large Chinese financial institution with whom we enjoy a nice distribution relationship. Importantly, the fund that Permal manages has performed relatively well through all of the turbulence that we've seen in the China markets. And as a result, that strategy we saw, I think we mentioned, about $800 million in flows into the strategy just in the last quarter. The strategy now has a total of about $1.5 billion. I would say that as it relates to sort of the attractiveness of that business, it's a lower fee rate than what their traditional institutional or retail fees would be, but they have opportunities. It's still an attractive management fee and they do have opportunities for incentive fees associated with it. As far as how it extends beyond just Permal, I mean, I can't give you what the growth rate could be, it could be significant, it could -- those flows can be a bit volatile, to be candid with you. We're excited about it. It bodes well for Permal. But those flows can be volatile, so we can't really predict what they will be. But what I'll tell you is that all of our affiliates really are in dialogue with Legg Mason, with our Global Distribution platform in terms of how can we extend this success at Permal and with this distributor into other products and into other channels in China. It's a complicated market. It's a difficult market to penetrate. We do cover it -- currently, we do not have a retail distribution office in China. We cover that or have our Hong Kong office responsible for that. But there's a lot of dialogue around how do we kind of parlay, if you will, the success that we're seeing with this distribution partner and with potential other distribution partners in China for our other affiliates. We do see opportunity there and we're excited about it."

But as you're talking about specifics, I can walk through that. In the March quarter, that's when we see FICA and social taxes kind of resetting as well as 401(k) matches and profit-sharing. Then in the June quarter, all of those factors continue up until the point we pay bonuses. And at that stage, our high earners all kind of get above the limits for those programs. But the other thing we had going on in the June quarter is that's also when we make our annual equity and deferred compensation awards. And as I mentioned on the call, there's some retirement eligibility. When people get within 4 years of our normal retirement age, which is 62, GAAP accounting requires you to kind of short -- even though the vesting period is still 4 years, people can vest after they have hypothetically retired, so long as their good levers don't compete, don't solicit. But the accounting rules changed a number of years ago on that, that If you're, say, 59, you've now got a 3-year service period, even though legally there, it's a 4-year period. So that had an impact in the quarter of about $0.05 this year and had about a $0.02 impact last year. So we have it every year. It was just a little bit elevated this year. We had a few high earners that hit it. But it's basically just accounting noise. It's accelerating the expense we take anyway. And basically no impact in terms of cash comp or no impact to our cash bottom line earnings. And I think probably the most important thing for everyone on the call is we expect next quarter to drop back to the 53%, 54% that we've been guiding to. And blended average by the time we get to the end of the year will be right in that 53%, 54% based on our current projections. Is that -- so I know it was a bit cloudy. Does that help?"

So the biggest issuers tend to be -- have the highest percentage capture in the index itself. In the broader kind of the Barclays agg, which everybody uses and is the kind of the main benchmark index, I think it's only 35% -- of the eligible securities in fixed income, only 35% are captured within that index. So that tells you that there's a whole world out there, 2/3 -- 2x as many securities and asset classes within fixed income that can be used, and in fact, active managers do use to kind of position their portfolio for different types of market environments. As you can imagine, given what's happened with the U.S. government over the last -- really since the crisis, the massive increase that we've seen in government issuance, treasuries are included in that index. So consequently, given that it's a market cap-weighted index, the U.S. Treasury component of it has been significantly -- has significantly increased. So that really allows for active managers who have the flexibility to go beyond that 35% of available products and strategies in fixed income to outperform governments. And spread products and credit products and unconstrained types of securities have the potential to significantly outperform treasuries. So the index itself is now much more Treasury or U.S. government security-related than it was even before the crisis because of the massive issuance of the government. The fact that -- look, it's different certainly in equities, but on the fixed income side, roughly 70% of all active fixed income managers beat the benchmark. Some of them, like us, like Brandywine and Western, beat it big time. But even the kind of average, median fixed income manager can beat the index. It's just not that hard. So for people who actually go into the index, we think they're making a choice to underperform over time or at least underperform their opportunity, for sure."

We recorded our",1823,"Thank you, Alan. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Legg Mason. I am pleased to report that Legg Mason delivered solid financial performance for the quarter and continued to make strategic progress against our longer-term goals. We recorded our fifth straight quarter of net long-term inflows driven by Western Asset, Brandywine Global, QS investors and Martin Currie. Revenues grew modestly, and our bottom line included the effect of seasonal deferred compensation expense, which Pete will walk you through in more detail. Our unfunded wins totaling $12 billion at quarter's end, some of which has funded in July, were also strong, underscoring the diversification of our business mix across asset class, client type and geography. 
As you all know, this has been a challenging time for the markets for our investors and by extension, our industry. Investors are inundated with headlines and financial programs that highlight a multitude of issues that they are dealing with today, including high equity valuations globally, the implications of rising rates, as well as broad geopolitical uncertainty. On a daily basis, they are trying to navigate such complex issues as a potential Greece default, China's slowdown and market volatility, as well as terrorism, none of which inspire confidence, particularly for retail investors. Such consternation has caused investors to pause, which is evidenced by quarterly industry flow data, most notably the $49 billion in outflows in active U.S. equity funds and $6 billion in active U.S. bond fund outflows during the quarter. I am pleased to report, however, $1.3 billion in net inflows for the quarter, driven by fixed income. This is especially gratifying given the market and industry headwinds that I just described. 
We continue to be very pleased with the success we are experiencing with QS Investors. We're encouraged by the early traction at Martin Currie, particularly in Australia, and we are quite excited by the recent announcement of our acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, which will expand our capabilities in liquid alternatives, specifically listed infrastructure, which we project to be a long-term, high-growth investment space. Again all in all, a solid quarter against the backdrop of a challenging environment. 
Now let me walk you through some of the details. Slide 2 highlights our financial results. We generated net income of $94.5 million or $0.84 per diluted share, and ended the quarter with Assets Under Management of just under $700 billion, and as I mentioned, with long-term net inflows of $1.3 billion. Global Distribution recorded gross and net sales of $19 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and we retired 1.7 million shares during the quarter.
Slide 3 shows our Assets Under Management by affiliate. I'll go into more detail on the next slide. However, I continue to be very pleased with the diversification across our affiliate portfolio and in particular, how our affiliates, our differentiated distribution channels and varied geographic business mix can balance one another across market cycles. And now with the announced acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, combined with continued product development across new and legacy affiliates, we will be even more diversified as we grow the business.
Slide 4 shows fund flows and unfunded wins at quarter end by affiliate. Again, it is here where you can see the impact of our business diversity. Let's start with fixed income flows. We continue to believe that Legg Mason is well positioned even as interest rates rise, and in fact, as I've said to many of you, we firmly believe that higher normalized rates will ultimately be good for our fixed income business. If you recall, in previous rising rate cycles, corporate credit and strategic income strategies, both strengths of our fixed income affiliates, actually saw meaningful inflows. We also see institutional investors rebalancing and increasing their allocations to fixed income broadly, and to LDI strategies in particular, in a higher rate environment.
Western Asset achieved $1 billion in net long-term inflows during the quarter with 8 of the largest 10 new accounts driven by specialized mandates. Western's quarter-end won but not yet funded pipeline stood at $2.3 billion. While retail fixed income flows have slowed a bit, nearly 90% of Western's AUM is institutional, which tends to be longer term in nature. Western is delivering strong performance broadly across their composites and continues to experience momentum with consultants, both of which bode well for the growth of their institutional business. 
Fixed income inflows at Brandywine Global were $1.7 billion, reflecting strong institutional flows in both separate accounts and cross-border funds. $2 billion of Brandywine's won but not yet funded pipeline is in fixed income, with just over $1 billion having funded this month. Finally, Brandywine's institutional sales pipeline continues to look very robust.
Now on to equities. Inflows at QS Investors, Brandywine and Martin Currie were offset by outflows at Royce and ClearBridge as weakness in the U.S. equity markets accelerated retail outflows. After 9 consecutive quarters of inflows, ClearBridge had net outflows of $800 million, driven primarily by a slowing of retail sales and reallocations in sub-advisory accounts, which are often seasonal in nature.
Royce experienced outflows again in the quarter and, as we've said for a while now, returning to sustained net inflows will take some time. Now I've spent a good amount of time with Royce and can say with conviction that we continue to believe in their long-term investment process and are very supportive of the steps that they've taken to strengthen their investment platform in the meantime.
QS Investors recorded $1.7 billion in net inflows and $3.4 billion in unfunded wins at quarter end, driven by the sub-advisory takeover wins that we've discussed on previous calls. Approximately $3 billion of those wins have funded in July. QS is a significant component of our new product development with 9 additional products expected to be launched this year. We are very energized by the strong partnership between QS, our product teams and Global Distribution, and we continue to see great long-term potential for continued growth.
Brandywine had net inflows of $400 million in equities and $3 billion of their total unfunded wins are across a number of their equity products. With strong investment performance, these products are seeing robust institutional interest. Martin Currie had $100 million of inflows and ended the quarter with $500 million in unfunded wins. Martin Currie has enjoyed early momentum with real asset strategies managed by their Australian team, while we continue to integrate their product set and commercialize their strategies across our Global Distribution platform.
And finally, alternatives. Permal's flows were negative for the quarter, though that doesn't really tell the entire story. Our reported AUM number for Permal does not include strong inflows into an Assets Under Advisement product in China, which was nearly $800 million for the quarter. While classified as Assets Under Advisement, this product has attractive fee characteristics, which, while lower than Permal's typical retail or institutional fees are still quite compelling. China continues to be a significant strategic opportunity, and we're very encouraged by Permal's progress there. As a reminder, nearly 70% of Permal's AUM is institutional currently as they continue to transition their business away from the European high net worth market. Broader U.S. retail for Permal continues to slowly build momentum with products gaining more shelf space at intermediaries, and we are just now launching a cross-border version of Permal's liquid alternative strategies that we believe will attract strong interest.
We announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire RARE Infrastructure, a firm with very attractive products and performance in global listed infrastructure, which is consistent with our strategy of acquiring new and differentiated investment capability that can be leveraged through our Global Distribution platform. So this is actually a good segue to spend a minute on this acquisition.
Let's start on Slide 5 with why this transaction is so compelling. Infrastructure as an asset class is very applicable to many investor objectives, specifically growth, income and capital preservation. These are global investment themes that we are addressing through ongoing product development in outcome-oriented products and through M&A, such as this transaction. The listed infrastructure space is growing quickly, and yet the opportunity is still developing, which gives us the opportunity to be a market leader in a rapidly growing area. We believe the supply of listed infrastructure investment opportunities should continue to expand as governments modernize and upgrade infrastructure. At the same time, fiscal constraints will compel governments across the globe to increasingly access the private sector to finance these projects. 
RARE is a market leader in listed infrastructure funds, particularly in Australia and Canada, markets that have been early adopters of this asset class. Their investment team has an excellent long-term track record with performance that consistently beats their stated return objectives. RARE offers a broad suite of products in both developing and emerging markets and has seen assets double the past 3 years, which highlights the potential of this business as we leverage it with our global retail distribution platform and introduce and market their products in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Obviously, we have developed a high degree of confidence in the RARE team. These are infrastructure professionals who now manage funds, not fund managers who have decided to create infrastructure products. Further, the founders have done a great job building a strong bench of investment talent and leadership under them. As is always critical, we have come to appreciate RARE's unique culture and how well it will fit within Legg Mason: smart people, talented people, good people. Finally, this is Legg Mason's first transaction, where we are leaving founder equity within the affiliate by purchasing less than 100% of the company. As we've discussed on previous earnings calls, we believe management equity is essential to optimizing long-term alignment. 
Slide 6 shows the performance of Legg Mason's Global Distribution platform for the quarter, which I would once again characterize as solid. Gross sales of $19 billion, while down from last quarter, were up 17% from the same quarter last year. The drop in gross sales, when combined with some of the sub-advisory reallocations in the quarter, contributed to a drop in net sales, although distribution was still net positive in flows overall. Additionally, our investment in distribution is starting to bear fruit, with a 65% increase in gross sales from certain previously undercovered advisers in the U.S. And finally, we continue to work closely with the SEC to obtain all the necessary approvals to offer strategies in an ETF wrapper. And we look forward to be able to provide more color with respect to our ETF plans in the near future.
Slide 7 shows our performance in the critical 3- and 5-year window across our strategy AUM and our long-term U.S. fund average. Performance at a few of our affiliates dipped a bit in this quarter, largely impacted by energy prices and emerging markets weakness. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Pete. Pete?"
180481,307265505,844654,"Legg Mason Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report continued long-term inflows along with earnings of $95 million or $0.84 per share for the quarter. At a high level, our revenues increased",1186,"Thanks, Joe. I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report continued long-term inflows along with earnings of $95 million or $0.84 per share for the quarter. At a high level, our revenues increased primarily due to an additional day in the quarter and a 1% increase in average long-term AUM, which more than offset lower performance fees. At the same time, our earnings benefited from some onetime tax items, mainly related to New York City tax code changes, which collectively contributed approximately $18 million or $0.16 per share to our quarterly results.
On the expense side, as we indicated on our last call, the increase from the prior quarter was the result of higher seasonal compensation expenses. This increase was somewhat elevated from the prior year's seasonal impacts due to accounting charges related to a slightly higher number of retirement-eligible employees receiving annual deferred compensation awards. Additionally, this quarter was impacted by severance packages for several highly compensated employees. 
Adjusted income was $129 million for the quarter or $1.14 per share. This quarter's performance fees of $19 million came from Permal, Brandywine and Western. These were at the higher end of our expectations as a result of strong performance, particularly at Permal and Brandywine. While impossible to predict with precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. In terms of capital deployment this quarter, we again retired $90 million in shares. In addition, 1 million shares of restricted stock were granted as part of our annual incentive compensation, so our weighted average shares were reduced by approximately 400,000.
Moving on to Slide 9. The only additional item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate of 21%. This quarter's rate is lower than normal, resulting largely from the New York City tax changes that I mentioned earlier. The tax outlook for next quarter is a return to a GAAP effective rate of approximately 36%. And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically, for this quarter, we were at 6%. And for the full fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 5%, as you can see on Page 20 in the appendix. This lower cash rate is anticipated to last at least through the end of this decade based on our current estimates.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Assets Under Management were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven by market depreciation of $7 billion. This more than offset positive net long-term and liquidity flows.
On Slide 11, you can see the long-term inflows were $1.3 billion and represented our fifth straight quarter of positive long-term inflows. Fixed income inflows of $2.6 billion reflected our strong performance in areas of market demand across a variety of strategies and products. Equity flows were negative, with small cap being the primary driver. Looking ahead, our July flows will be positive based on what we know at the moment, driven by equity wins, including a large custom asset allocation mandate and a variety of institutional fixed income wins, although we anticipate these will be partially offset by the ongoing redemptions at Royce.
You will see on Slide 12 that we are disclosing our total operating revenue yield ex performance fees. We feel this view is a more helpful depiction of our revenue yield trends and will help you more accurately model our revenues going forward. This quarter's higher rate was primarily due to the growth in average long-term AUM, along with a decline in average lower fee liquidity AUM.
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased by $11 million or 2% to $584 million. I will discuss comp and benefits on the next slide. But looking at the other line items, D&S expense increased, reflecting one additional day in the quarter along with costs related to merging certain fund ranges in Europe. Also I wanted to highlight for next quarter, we expect D&S expense to remain at the 22% level we saw in the June quarter. Other expenses decreased $5 million as the prior quarter's expenses included higher advertising and consulting spend. 
Turning to Slide 14. Compensation and benefits increased by $12 million while benefits and payroll taxes were up $17 million, largely due to the increase in seasonal costs. $7 million of that increase was affiliate related, and thus offset in salary and incentives. Additionally, the seasonal costs included $9 million of incremental accounting charges related to annual deferred compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 56%, higher than our full year expected range due to these seasonal factors. We do expect this ratio to drop back down to the 53% to 54% range for the remainder of fiscal 2016.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which decreased from last quarter's 23.8%. The incremental impact of the retirement-eligible accounting charges on the current quarter's operating margin was 1.7%. So we expect our margin to improve next quarter as these costs abate.
Slide 16 is a roll-forward from fiscal Q4's GAAP earnings per share of $0.73 to this quarter's $0.84 per share. Fiscal Q4 was a pretty clean quarter, only impacted by a lower tax rate, which increased last quarter's earnings per share by $0.03. This quarter, higher revenues were offset by the seasonally higher benefit costs, which combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.01. The change in mark-to-market on our seed investments decreased earnings per share also by $0.01. And finally, for fiscal Q1, as I previously noted, tax changes increased earnings per share by $0.16.
I'll wrap up on Slide 17, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 53 million shares or 32% since March 2010, while in the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over this same time frame. We now have 6 straight years of increased annual dividends, and we are particularly proud of the magnitude of those increases since 2010, which is approaching 600%. And as you can see, in total, we have returned a very robust $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the last 5 years, a rate of return that is industry-leading.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which has been relatively consistent over the past year. As expected, our cash balance is at its typical seasonal low point for the year due to cash bonuses paid in mid-May. Finally on the bottom right, we highlight our current seed investments of $328 million across a diversified portfolio by asset class. This is a $63 million decrease from fiscal Q4, as we were able to redeem some of our seed investments from products that no longer required capital support. 
So thank you for your time and for your interest in Legg Mason. Now I'll turn it back to Joe."

Legg Mason has a truly global perspective, capability set and footprint, which guides us in delivering products that address and solve the increasingly complex needs of investors. I want to emphasize once again that we are well positioned in fixed income even with a potential U.S. interest rate hike on the horizon. 
With nearly 90% of our fixed income business institutional in nature, we believe that demand from investors will remain strong, particularly for the credit, absolute return, global and unconstrained products in which Brandywine and Western Asset have long track records and excellent performance. We continue to believe strongly in active management in fixed income and the data clearly shows that core active fixed income managers have consistently and meaningfully beaten their benchmarks over time. This fact reflects the flawed construction of fixed income indices and the diversity of investment opportunity to active managers. And we believe our active fixed income managers have demonstrated time and again that they are among the best in the business. 
Obviously, a rising rate environment will also make our money market offerings more attractive, and we believe that Western is well positioned after evolving their product set to capture opportunities as regulatory reform is implemented. We don't often talk about this, but rising interest rates and the more normalized economic and market environment that they represent should also provide opportunity for our active equity managers, particularly Permal and Royce, whose investment styles have been out of favor in this persistently and abnormally low rate environment. 
We continue to fill product gaps and strengthen and diversify our affiliate portfolio. We are very pleased with the initial work to commercialize the investment capabilities that QS Investors and Martin Currie have brought to us. The momentum that QS Investors is showing, particularly in the insurance sub-advisory space, is very encouraging. The progress that our ETF team has made in building an infrastructure to offer strategies in an ETF wrapper is also very exciting. As I mentioned, we are working diligently with the SEC and look forward to providing an update after necessary approvals are obtained. The pending acquisition of RARE Infrastructure will bring a highly regarded, deeply experienced team with a focus on a liquid alternative asset class that has significant opportunity to grow. 
And finally, Legg Mason continues to deliver organic growth. And we believe our pipeline represents significant opportunity to capture assets across an increasingly diversified affiliate portfolio. Our unfunded wins and pipeline are diverse, highlighting the strong performance of client-relevant products across our affiliates. As we continue to bring these products to market and engage the advisers who partner with us, we expect to continue to further capture market share globally. And finally, as we execute against our strategic business plans, we intend to optimize shareholder returns through buybacks and growing our dividend over time. 
And now we look forward to taking your questions."

Matter of fact, they are the largest player in the listed mutual fund space there. If you look at Morningstar data, in Australia, their value in their EM funds comprise about 39% of that market. And in Canada, the sub-advised fund, which is basically a clone of their flagship fund, has about 45% market share. And so for me, there's kind of 2 main things that come out of that. First, I think it's a testament to the quality of the franchise and the credibility of the team and then certainly the performance of the products. But secondly, it really points to the LMGD opportunity that we have in partnering with RARE. They have spent very little time and energy and effort looking to grow their business in the U.S. and in Europe and in Asia. And certainly if you know our LMGD platform, that's where we're very well positioned. So we will look to continue to leverage some of their existing UCITS programs into the cross-border space. We'll probably increase the registrations there. The U.S., we'll have to create some new vehicles.

As a reminder, we are one of the largest providers of retail SMAs in the business. So we've long been accustomed to a greater degree of transparency. One of the great opportunities we do see, however, is the evolution of what many call smart beta. And we see that as an opportunity to evolve the passive market beyond kind of the traditional market cap weighted strategies by using different factor-based strategies that really better reflect client objectives. These types of products, these smart beta types of products, may be best offered in an ETF vehicle, so we want to be prepared to be able to do that.

First of all, to be candid, yes, I think we actually outperformed -- when you see a combination much as we did with QS, an acquisition -- any acquisition but then also a combination, if you recall",534,"So great question, Mike. Look, I think a couple of things. First of all, to be candid, yes, I think we actually outperformed -- when you see a combination much as we did with QS, an acquisition -- any acquisition but then also a combination, if you recall, we combined Batterymarch with QS. And whenever you see something like that, you expect that, that sort of gives clients an opportunity to rethink and potentially to redeem. We retained much more of the Batterymarch and QS assets through the first year of transition than we expected. So we were pleased with the retention of existing business post acquisition. We've also been, and to be perfectly candid with you, surprised at the strength of flows and business with QS. But when you step back and think about it, QS is in the sweet spot right now. Virtually every type of client that we talk to is interested in talking about and considering customized strategies. And our -- and QS's ability to be able to do that, to really be able to understand the needs of the client, and then customize a strategy either using ETFs or using some of our managers or some combination of the 2 is really quite compelling. As far as what are we doing differently or better, I just think we're doing a good job of execution. I think many -- our pipeline, our M&A pipeline is as robust as it's ever been. I think that's a function of the environment. I think it's tougher for smaller managers right now. We know that costs are rising. Fees, there's pressure on fees. So it's a tough environment for many managers. And when they look out there, the ability to join a firm to retain their investment independence, to retain their operational autonomy, to be able to tap into this Global Distribution platform, which I think QS and Martin Currie, already, their eyes are wide open with the power and strength of that platform. And then in some cases, some choose to tap into various of our other shared services to realize operational efficiency. That's a pretty good combination. And so we've just -- I think we're attracting a lot of interest right now. And I've got to give credit to our distribution teams and our product teams and all of our shared service, what we call the value chain, of Legg Mason, for really executing well and delivering. Now some of the stuff just takes time. It takes time, as Tom mentioned and I've talked about before, to get things through the pipe in terms of product creation and the regulatory hurdles and all that kind of stuff. But in the meantime, particularly as it relates to this insurance sub-advisory capability, which is really quasi-institutional, we can get moving on that pretty much right away. So I think it's we've got an attractive model. We find the right partners. It's got to be the right chemistry and the right culture. And then -- so our business model is drawing them. We have the right culture, what we believe to be the right culture going in, and then I think it's been good execution."

We are able to continue the buyback and we've been increasing our dividend. I don't want to say we can do it all forever.

Their growth, their CAGR in terms of AUM revenues have been running higher than 20%. So we don't see any reason why that should slow down. They're in a market that has $2 trillion worth of securities that can be invested in. So they've got -- there's no constraint in terms of size.

The only other thing -- and in terms of rev share, and keep in mind, we don't disclose specific rev shares for each affiliate for obvious competitive reasons.

Specifically, the opportunity I mentioned with respect to China was Permal. That is a strategy that was launched in 2014 with a large Chinese financial institution with whom we enjoy a nice distribution relationship. Importantly, the fund that Permal manages has performed relatively well through all of the turbulence that we've seen in the China markets. And as a result, that strategy we saw, I think we mentioned about $800 million in flows into the strategy just in the last quarter. The strategy now has a total of about $1.5 billion. I would say that as it relates to sort of the attractiveness of that business, it's a lower fee rate than what their traditional institutional or retail fees would be, but they have opportunities. It's still an attractive management fee and they do have opportunities for incentive fees associated with it. As far as how it extends beyond just Permal, I mean, I can't give you what the growth rate could be, it could be significant, it could -- those flows can be a bit volatile, to be candid with you. We're excited about it. It bodes well for Permal. But those flows can be volatile, so we can't really predict what they will be. But what I'll tell you is that all of our affiliates really are in dialogue with Legg Mason, with our Global Distribution platform in terms of how can we extend this success at Permal and with this distributor into other products and into other channels in China. It's a complicated market. It's a difficult market to penetrate. We do cover it currently. We do not have a retail distribution office in China. We cover that -- or have our Hong Kong office responsible for that.

But as you're talking about specifics, I can walk through that. In the March quarter, that's when we see FICA and social taxes kind of resetting as well as 401(k) matches and profit-sharing. Then in the June quarter, all of those factors continue up until the point we pay bonuses. And at that stage, our high earners all kind of get above the limits for those programs. But the other thing we had going on in the June quarter is that's also when we make our annual equity and deferred compensation awards. And as I mentioned on the call, there's some retirement eligibility. When people get within 4 years of our normal retirement age, which is 62, GAAP accounting requires you to kind of short -- even though the vesting period is still 4 years, people can vest after they have hypothetically retired, so long as their good levers don't compete, don't solicit. But the accounting rules changed a number of years ago on that, that if you're, say, 59, you've now got a 3-year service period, even though legally there, it's a 4-year period. So that had an impact in the quarter of about $0.05 this year and it had about a $0.02 impact last year. So we have it every year. It was just a little bit elevated this year. We had a few high earners that hit it. But it's basically just accounting noise. It's accelerating the expense we take anyway. And it's basically no impact in terms of cash comp -- or no impact to our cash bottom line earnings. And I think probably the most important thing for everyone on the call is we expect next quarter to drop back to the 53%, 54% that we've been guiding to. And blended average by the time we get to the end of the year will be right in that 53%, 54% based on our current projections. Does that -- so I know it was a bit cloudy. Does that help?"

So the biggest issuers tend to be -- have the highest percentage capture in the index itself. In the broader kind of the Barclays agg, which everybody uses and is the kind of the main benchmark index, I think it's only 35% -- of the eligible securities in fixed income, only 35% are captured within that index. So that tells you that there's a whole world out there, 2/3 -- 2x as many securities and asset classes within fixed income that can be used, and in fact, active managers do use to kind of position their portfolio for different types of market environments. As you can imagine, given what's happened with the U.S. government over the last -- really since the crisis, the massive increase that we've seen in government issuance, treasuries are included in that index. So consequently, given that it's a market cap-weighted index, the U.S. Treasury component of it has been significantly -- has significantly increased. So that really allows for active managers who have the flexibility to go beyond that 35% of available products and strategies in fixed income to outperform governments. And spread products and credit products and unconstrained types of securities have the potential to significantly outperform treasuries. So the index itself is now much more Treasury or U.S. government security-related than it was even before the crisis because of the massive issuance of the government. The fact that -- look, it's different certainly in equities, but on the fixed income side, roughly 70% of all active fixed income managers beat the benchmark. Some of them, like us, like Brandywine and Western, beat it big time. But even the kind of average, median fixed income manager can beat the index. It's just not that hard. So for people who actually go into the index, we think they're making a choice to underperform over time, or at least underperform their opportunity, for sure."

Markets around the world experienced a significant return to volatility during the quarter and that certainly affected our clients, Legg Mason and our industry as a whole.
Changes in how investors are thinking about equity valuations, uncertainty around the timing and impact of interest rate increases, volatility in oil and commodities, and concerns about the overall global macroeconomic environment, all served to create a higher degree of uneasiness, particularly with retail investors. The results of these forces was a dramatic increase in active mutual fund outflows in the U.S. totaling $103 billion, while internationally, long-term cross-border fund inflows reversed by nearly $100 billion to outflows of just over $50 billion during the quarter.
Yet, against the this market backdrop, the increasingly diversified nature of our business was validated. Specifically, I'm pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth with positive long-term net flows of $3.1 billion and an organic growth rate of 2.2%.
Now as Pete will explain, we also experienced some non-operating factors that adversely impacted our financials. But I am pleased with our quarterly operating performance and continued strategic progress. Positive long-term inflows were driven largely by fixed income though, we recorded modest inflows in equities as well.
Brandywine Global, QS Investors and Western Asset all have positive long-term inflows for the quarter, while Martin Currie was breakeven.
While gross and net sales in global distribution were down quarter-over-quarter, gross sales in our global retail platform year-to-date are actually ahead of last year. Our global retail net sales numbers while positive, are a bit behind year-over-year.
Operating earnings and operating margins as adjusted were healthy and our pipeline of unfunded wins remains strong at $9.4 billion at quarter's end.
Most importantly for the long run, however, we continue to diversify our affiliate mix with an expanded set of investment capabilities that as recent markets demonstrate, are critical for our clients as they navigate market turbulence.
As you know, investor needs and preferences continue to evolve. Increasingly, investment strategies that are more flexible and outcome oriented can better address those changes. Consistent with this evolving client demand, I'm pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure on October 21st, adding further strength to investment capability in highly differentiated asset classes and strategy. So now, let's walk through the quarter.
On Slide 2, you'll see that we recorded net income of $64.3 million for the quarter or $0.58 per diluted share. We ended the quarter with $672 billion in AUM, a decrease quarter-over-quarter driven largely by market depreciation. As I mentioned, long-term net inflows were $3.1 million and Global Distribution generated quarterly gross and net sales of $18.1 billion and $500 million, respectively.
We retired 1.9 million shares for $90 million, and as I noted a minute ago, we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure. 
Slide 3 shows our assets under management by affiliate as well as by asset class, geography and client type. As you can see, assets under management at our fixed income oriented affiliates held up well, and with the exception of QS, which had a very strong flow quarter, assets under management at most of our equity affiliates declined driven by both market depreciation and retail outflows.
Slide 4 shows our affiliate overview of flows and pipeline and the $9.4 billion pipeline of unfunded wins at quarter end reflects the resiliency of our underlying business. While our growth last fiscal year was largely driven by retail flows, growth this fiscal year has been driven more by our institutional business, again, demonstrating the diversification of our book of business.
Now as I walk you through each affiliate, I'll touch on a few highlights for each. So let's get started.
Brandywine enjoyed very strong inflows during the quarter made up of $1.3 billion in equity and $1.5 billion in fixed income flows and leaving $4.5 billion in unfunded wins. Two takeaways. While short-term performance has been a bit challenged, Brandywine's 3-, 5- and 10-year track records remain impressive. The flows, pipeline and momentum at Brandywine has been quite strong with the company having achieved its eighth straight quarter of positive net flows.
ClearBridge Investments experienced $1.8 billion in outflow for the quarter reflecting both a slowing of sales and an uptick in redemptions and retail and a rebalancing in the sub-advisory channels. Quarter end unfunded wins were $500 million. For ClearBridge, the vast majority of outflow experienced has actually been clustered in income type strategies. However, ClearBridge is seeing significant platform and model opportunities in their high active share and international equity suite with many of distribution partners. 
Martin Currie was breakeven for the quarter and closed with $500 million in unfunded wins. Highlights include investment performance of broadly improved during the tough quarter specifically in Asia active share, equity income, and European long short, and integration and collaboration in product transition and distribution between Martin Currie and Legg Mason is at a very high level.
Permal had $300 million in outflows and $300 million in unfunded wins for the quarter. Permal's highlights include performance year-to-date that is solid on a relative basis though slightly negative in absolute terms. Recent retail adoption of Permal's products is encouraging with $500 million in positive flows in the China AUA strategy, a slight pickup in the U.S. liquid strategy and the launch of a cross-border version of the same U.S. liquid fund. And finally, a slowing of outflows in the European high net worth business that has persisted across the industry for some time.
QS Investors realized $2.8 billion in inflows for the quarter, reflecting strong interest in multi-asset products in the sub-advisory channel. There's just a lot going on right now at QS including strong interest on the part of quasi-institutional clients and customized multi-asset class solutions. Investment performance in both developed and emerging market equity strategies at QS that is very strong representing an important growth opportunity, and the opportunity in the retail channel to get shelf space for their products on multiple dissertation platforms. And important to cite, QS Investors is a critical partner for us in the continued development of next-generation products from multi-asset class solutions, manageable retail strategies and retail liquid alternatives. QS is also the designated manager on the 4 ETF strategies, which we filed with the SEC back in September. 
Royce & Associates had $2.2 billion in outflows, a modest slowing of roughly $500 million quarter-over-quarter. While we have acknowledged that this will be a long recovery for Royce, we believe in their investment process, the intellectual capital and leadership at Royce, and their continued commitment to high active share with high-quality companies in their universe.
And finally, Western Asset with $1.9 billion in fixed income inflows and a pipeline of $3.6 billion in unfunded wins. Three key highlights for Western. Western is now on the recommended list of 90% of Tier 1 consultants, up from about 20% just a year ago. Clearly, related RFP activity is strong, trending higher than last year, and it is Western's view and ours, that the longer-term money in motion opportunity is still in play. And finally, it is certainly been a challenging 15-month period for credit, especially in this past quarter with the benchmark outperforming many managers including Western. That said, we're encouraged by Western's performance in high grade and broad market portfolios versus peers during this period. 
Slide 5 gives an overview of our recently closed acquisition of RARE Infrastructure. RARE is a very high-quality firm that has delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. The company has a seasoned investment team and strong institutional and retail presence in a number of markets. This acquisition is the first in which we've left equity within the affiliate thereby, better aligning the long-term interest of Legg Mason shareholders with the management team at RARE. Global listed infrastructure as an investment strategy meets client demand on multiple fronts including growth, income, and capital preservation.
Now I don't want to oversell this because like our other acquisitions, positioning a new affiliate for retail distribution takes time. However, I'd like to share 2 exciting and reinforcing notes about the acquisition.
First, despite the fact that we have not been able to solicit interest in RARE until we closed the transaction, we've received a number of inbound calls from clients interested in learning about their capabilities and products. Post close, we are now able to follow-up with those clients and are obviously encouraged by their interest. We'll see what turns up from there.
Second, we are able to immediately begin distributing RARE's existing cross-border funds to select European clients looking for income and yield.
Slide 6 highlights the results from our Global Distribution platform, which had modest net positive sales for the quarter. Our results reflect a general pullback by retail investors amidst volatility and declines in many world equity indices and markets.  Our retail market share remains steady as global outflows from active funds across the industry increased significantly.
Gross sales of $18.1 billion were down 8% from the year-ago period and down 5% from the prior quarter, though, again, year-to-date gross sales on the platform remain ahead of last year. For the quarter, large, sub-advisory wins that funded with QS and Brandywine Global were offset by outflows in retail.
Net sales were also down from the prior quarter due to lower sales and higher redemption rates, generally in line with global industry trends.
Slide 7 shows investment performance. Short-term performance in some larger fixed income portfolios was challenged through September, while equity performance improved at a number of affiliates.
Long-term performance remains solid with more than 80% of strategy AUM beating benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years.
And with that, let me turn it over to the Pete."
180481,314065733,886741,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we were pleased to report our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows. On the earnings front, we were negatively impacted by markets, which led to a $17 billio",1459,"Thanks, Joe. I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we were pleased to report our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows. On the earnings front, we were negatively impacted by markets, which led to a $17 billion decline in average AUM. This reduced our revenues while also negatively impacting our seed and other corporate investments resulting in earnings of $64 million or $0.58 per share for the quarter.
At a high level, our revenue decrease was primarily driven by the decline in average long-term AUM, mix and lower performance fees.
In terms of expenses, the main driver of the decline in operating expenses was the drop in compensation due to lower revenues and a reduction from last quarter's higher seasonal compensation.
All in, the net result was operating income that was $9 million greater than the prior quarter. 
As for our bottom line net income, our earnings were adversely impacted by market forces on our seed and other corporate investments not offsetting compensation as well as the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on an Australian dollar hedge we put in place relating to the RARE acquisition.
The combined impact in the quarter of these 2 nonoperating items was $23 million or $0.13 per share.
Adjusted income was $99 million for the quarter or $0.89 per share. This quarter's performance fees of $8 million came from Brandywine, Martin Currie and Western. These were below our expectations as of our last call due to market headwinds, which led to decreases in absolute performance, particularly at Permal and Brandywine. While it is impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million.
In terms of capital deployment, we again retired $90 million in shares during the quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 9, the main item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 30.5%. This is lower than normal due largely to the finalization of open tax audits, which resulted in the release of certain reserves.
The outlook for next quarter is a return to a GAAP effective rate of approximately 36%. And as we have highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter, we were at 6% and for the full fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 5%, as you can see on Page 21 in the appendix. This lower cash rate is anticipated to last at least through the end of this decade based on our current estimates.
Turning to Slide 10. Our ending assets under management were down 4% despite $3.1 billion in long-term inflows. The AUM decline was driven by a combination of market depreciation, FX movements and liquidity outflows, all of which totaled $30 billion.
It is important to note, this ending AUM number is now our starting point for fiscal Q3, which is 2 percentage points lower than our average AUM for the second fiscal quarter. This, along with asset class and product mix shifts, would negatively impact our advisory fee revenue next quarter.
On Slide 11, you can see that our long-term inflows were $3.1 billion, representing our sixth straight quarter of positive long-term flows. Fixed income inflows were $3 billion reflecting strong demand despite market forces across a variety of our affiliates' strategies and products.
Equity flows were also a positive $100 million thanks to custom multi-asset and dynamic allocations that offset small cap and equity income outflows.
Looking ahead, our October flows should be positive based on what we know at the moment driven in part by institutional fixed income wins at both Brandywine and Western across a variety of products.
You will see on Slide 10 that our total operating revenue yield x performance fees declined from last quarter primarily driven by the significant market decline in equity AUM. And here, the rounding is important as last quarter's equity was 28.4% of our average AUM versus 27.6% for this quarter, so an 80 basis point drop but both rounding to 28%.
Operating expenses on Slide 13 decreased by $44 million or 8% to $540 million.
I'll discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items, D&S expense decreased reflecting the significant decline in AUM due to markets. Other expenses decreased $2 million despite RARE-related acquisition cost and seasonal director fee expenses as both affiliates and LM corporate decreased their spending in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 14, compensation and benefits decreased by $33 million or 10%. The primary driver behind the decline was lower compensation from revenue share affiliates due to lower revenues.
Additionally, last quarter's seasonal cost of $11 million included $9 million on the incremental accounting charges related to annual deferred compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 54%, in line with our 53% to 54% target for fiscal 2016.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased from last quarter's 22.6%. Last quarter's margin was impacted by the retirement-eligible accounting charges, which reduced the margin by 1.7%.
Looking forward to fiscal Q3, the operating margin will be impacted by approximately $3 million in incremental spending related to the ETF launched that Joe mentioned earlier. 
Moving on to Slide 16. Due to the significant impact of markets on our seed and other corporate investments this quarter, we provided this slide, which shows the changes from last quarter's nonoperating income of $6 million to this quarter's nonoperating expense of $28 million or a $34 million swing. As I mentioned earlier, due to the stronger dollar, there was an $11 million negative mark-to-market impact on an Australian dollar hedge used to lock in the RARE purchase price.
And to give you a little more color on this item, the Austrian dollar recovered in October so that when we closed the hedge earlier this month, there was a $6.6 million positive mark, which you will see in fiscal Q3.
Overall, the hedge locked in an effective $20 million reduction in the RARE purchase price due to a stronger U.S. dollar since the signing of this deal.
The rest of this table walk you down to the mark-to-market on seed investments, not offsetting compensation, which was a negative $13 million compared with a positive of $0.5 million last quarter.
In the lower left chart, you can see the market value of our seed and deferred compensation portfolio as of September 30. To the right, you can see the mark-to-market change embedded in the 3 buckets of seed investments as well as the deferred compensation component not offset income expense.
Slide 17 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 to this quarter's $0.58 per share. Fiscal Q1 included a tax benefit, which increased our earnings per share by $0.16.
For our fiscal second quarter, higher operating income and the impact of our share repurchases increased earnings per share by $0.02. The change of mark-to-market on our seed and corporate investments not offsetting comp reduced earnings per share by $0.10 quarter-over-quarter.
And finally, for fiscal Q2, the combination of the RARE hedge and acquisition costs as well as the settlement of prior-year tax filings combined to reduce EPS by 2 pennies.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 55 million shares or 34% since March 2010.
In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same time frame. We now have achieved 6 straight years of increased annual dividends and we're particularly pleased with the magnitude of those increases since 2010, which is over 600%.
In total, we've returned a very robust $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders since we began our buyback program in 2010, a rate of capital return that is industry-leading. I should point out that this represents half of our current market cap and we have done this while delevering to a significant degree and making a number of strategic investment in our business.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which was up from our seasonally low first fiscal quarter. Also, it is important to note that we use $178 million of cash in closing the RARE acquisition in October.
Finally on the bottom right, you can see the mix of our $326 million in seed investments. 
So thank you for your time and for your interest in Legg Mason. Now we'll turn it back to Joe."

Our job every day is to navigate markets to the benefit of our clients and shareholders. And we remain confident in the strategic plan we have executed over the past 3 years. We believe that it is working and that it will result in long-term",811,"Thanks, Pete. Our job every day is to navigate markets to the benefit of our clients and shareholders. And we remain confident in the strategic plan we have executed over the past 3 years. We believe that it is working and that it will result in long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.
So before we take questions, let me leave you with what we see as the 5 key takeaways for Legg Mason from today.
First, we delivered solid operating performance in a challenging market environment. Market forces certainly affected our earnings per share, but even with lower revenues, we're pleased with both our operating earnings and margins as adjusted.
Next, Legg Mason continues to grow organically and we enjoyed a strong new business pipeline. This was our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows and organic growth rate of 2.2%. We have a strong lineup of investment affiliates in place, smart, experienced, capable people who can deliver for our clients through market cycles.
Our won but not yet funded pipeline is over $9 billion reflecting especially solid demand at Brandywine Global and Western Asset. The interest generated by QS Investors, now in their second year as a Legg Mason affiliate, has exceeded expectations and we expect to translate that momentum through our DCIO sales channel over time.
Across our retail platform, we see opportunities building in equity strategies at ClearBridge and Martin Currie and alternative strategies from Permal.
Finally, we believe that the RARE Infrastructure acquisition can now be another engine of differentiated growth for Legg Mason.
Three, Legg Mason is well positioned for a normalized rate environment whenever that time comes. The Fed has reiterated that they expect to raise rates later this year and that it will be a gradual, data dependent process. We are ready for that increase whenever it comes.
But that's not the main event for bond markets right now. With a subdued inflation outlook and moderate growth, bond yields are likely to remain relatively low for an extended period of time. The relative performance of our fixed income platform is what matters. We have a high degree of confidence in the excellence of Brandywine Global and Western Asset management, 2 premiere fixed income managers with enviable investment track records over many market cycles.
The institutional nature of our fixed income book of business, currently around 90% of the total, should also prove more resilient as rates rise. We believe that our recent institutional fixed income flows support this view.
Institutional flows at Brandywine and Western were quite solid in what was a very volatile market environment. For some of our equity managers, which tend to be more quality focused, a Fed rate hike should also benefit their performance and our clients as a normalized rate environment should reduce correlations and create opportunities for high-quality, active managers such as Royce, Martin Currie and Permal. From our standpoint, a normalized rate environment can't come fast enough.
For strategic opportunities to diversify our business are abundant. First of all, we are very pleased with our recent acquisitions. The market for M&A is strengthening and Legg Mason is increasingly seen as an acquirer of choice. With regard to future acquisitions, we continue to think about how to fill remaining product gaps including energy, private equity and real estate. We have been very active in product development, launching more than 23 new absolute return and unconstrained next-generation products over the past 2 years. We are in a much stronger position to serve the varying needs of our clients and deliver for shareholders than we were only 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp up product development and shelf space for QS Investors and Martin Currie. Last week, we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure whose products can help us further meet important client demands for income, capital preservation and diversification. RARE has a long track record of success in early adopter markets, such as Australia and Canada, and we believe global demand for their liquid, long-dated assets will grow in the U.S., on the continent and in Asia where we have strong distribution capability.
And as for our much anticipated initial ETF efforts, our legal and product teams are working with the SEC and the Street to launch an initial set of strategies soon. I look forward to updating you as that initiative progresses.
And finally, we remain committed to thoughtful capital deployment. We have pledged to balance growth investments with dividends and share repurchases and we've done that. Ultimately, our goal is to further leverage Legg Mason's global scale while continuing to diversify the business and we're succeeding. We remain confident that our shareholders will benefit as we execute on growth, diversification and profitability. We have more opportunities before us and more work to do. 
And with all that said, I am happy to take your questions."

So we are pleased during the past quarter and frankly, on an ongoing basis with what we see in terms of the institutional business for both Brandywine and Western. But with respect to both of them, we saw a significant amount of industry outflow on the taxable side roughly I think $45 billion or so during the quarter. Western was out I think $200 million. Brandywine had a bit more maybe around $500 million, so very modest outflow there. We do believe that we are below what should be an appropriate market share for us in taxable fixed income with Western. And you're exactly right. Given the performance, we should and would do expect to pick up market share in taxables with retail as we go forward. Actually, among our -- you'll notice if you look back on our Slide 6, Western Asset Core Plus in terms of bond funds was our largest -- has been our largest seller in terms of the retail side. So we are looking forward to growing our market share. We have seen inflows month to date in retail at Western. And we think there's just significant opportunity in retail as well as the institutional side, where our unfunded pipeline is continuing to build."

So just again at high level, for October, we still have today to go and things can happen, and we are always need to sort true up across the global organization for a few days after the month ends. But I would tell you that for October, with what we're seeing right now, we've got a very solid flow month in place. Equities look to be close to breakeven. Fixed income looks to be strongly positive. As Pete mentioned in his remarks, those are largely institutional fixed income wins at both Brandywine and Western. But as I mentioned, Western's positive retail as well. And then our unfunded pipe for the -- as of the end of October looks to be very, very strong. As for Permal, their business continues to be -- they continue to be largely institutionally. We did see a slight slowing in the outflow from the European high net worth business. I don't a want to overstate that but it was a nice reversal in little bit, a slowing in that trend. We're actually hoping to go after the European retail business with the launch of our liquid alternatives fund, the really the blue in the cross-border space. It's really a clone of the U.S. strategy we have. So we've seen outflow over the last several years from the European high net worth space. We think we can go after some of that money with our new cross-border fund there. We've also -- we also had just very significant performance with Permal on the flow side out of China during the second quarter where that strategy, which as you remember, is an AUA strategy. It has characteristics, fee that are attractive, but it's strictly classified as AUA. We saw about I think, $700 million in flows into that strategy. That strategy performed well from an investment performance standpoint. And we saw a really nice flows. That fund now is up over $2 billion. But all that said, Permal has continued to evolve, increasingly to the institutional side of the business, but we are -- they are working to continue building out the retail space. We've seen a small pickup in U.S. retail in Permal strategies. So that's been encouraging, small pickup there. We're hopeful of a similar pickup in Europe and then strong in the retail side with our distribution partner in China. So I think that's perhaps it."

But -- and that I think was in the small cap space, which was nice win for us because that's actually part -- goes back to part of the legacy Batterymarch strategy, which is performing very, very well. You also want to remember that we have been very successful in getting QS on a number of platforms. Those don't necessarily come with takeover AUM, but they give you an opportunity for just consistent steady flow and I think we've got them upwards of 10 different platforms over the last year. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, QS is going to be the manager for our smart beta strategies, which we hope to launch at the end of this year or early next year. So the interest and activity level at QS is extraordinarily high. And in addition, just in terms of sort of product development, QS is working very closely with a number of our other affiliates and looking at sort of multi-asset class active strategies where they can capitalize on Brandywine or Western Asset or ClearBridge and putting those together. So strong interest in what QS does, strong activity, strong results, I would say, and just a real good feeling about what they are doing."

So, Mike the way I think about it, I would let Pete maybe try to take away on the fee rate a little bit. But the way I think about it is that you're right, I mean we're seeing some choppiness in performance in the last few months and a couple of quarters. But if you look at really at the 3-year, 5-year, which is where most clients really look, overall the performance across the platform remains very, very strong. We know that Royce has been challenged. But aside from Royce, our equity and fixed income performance is just really strong. We saw meaningful improvement, I would say, overall in our equity strategies towards the end of the last quarter. We saw improvement at Royce actually. We saw improvement at ClearBridge with appreciation a large cap value, Brandywine their diversified large-cap value strategy. We saw a nice improvement in performance there. Martin Currie had a significant improvement in 1 year performance predominately out of their European and China strategies. And then QS, their strategies is particularly the legacy develop and market strategies are just performing at a very, very high level. I think, again if you look at the 3, 5s and 10s for Western, they're north of 80% of strategies beating their benchmarks. So we feel good about the longer-term 3-, 5-, 10-year. We have had some job and is an up-and-down in the short term, but clients and to work through a little bit, which is why you are continuing to see fundings. Now in terms of sort of the unfunded wins at Brandywine, for example, you're seeing unfunded wins largely an opportunistic fixed income and corporate debt and then in large-cap equity. At Western, it's really corporate debt, high-yield, more broad -- and then broader market strategies. And then but on the equity side, some of the unfunded wins, both ClearBridge and Martin Currie have ended the quarter with unfunded wins around the $500 million area. In the case of Martin Currie, that was really a regional equity and emerging market equity. And ClearBridge, their unfundeds really were around aggressive growth and equity income. Pete, do you want to maybe talk to Mike about how you see the fee rate from all of that soup that I just put together?"

Obviously, severely impacted not just us, but everybody else's portfolios. And equity, as it's going to be returning a bit more than fixed, clearly a lot more than liquidity. But, we've recovered probably half of that due to the market rebound in October. And then, when you look at the underlying trends, particularly in our fixed income business, there's really a tray going on between lower fee outflows and higher fee inflows from specialized products. That's really become a much more pronounced. The other thing that is going on just about a bit retail and institutional, our Global Distribution business actually had a 8 straight quarters of inflows. But again, that tends to be higher fees. So the underlying trends are pretty positive, overall despite the blip that was caused by the market this last month."

And as I said in the prepared remarks, that's up really from 20%, I think 14 months ago. So you've seen a significant turnaround there. Obviously, consultants have a significant and huge influence over institutional flows and we're seeing that play right into the level of activity, the RFP activity at Western, which is running reasonably ahead of last year, which is good. And then I mentioned, on the one of my comments that Western believes, and we do as well, that this sort of money in motion opportunity continues to be real. It's going to take time. And I can't -- we're not really pulling it out anymore. But we are seeing RFP activity and in some cases, simply, we've actually seen some modest takeovers without even RFPs that are really directly tied to sort of money in motion. So with all of that is going on and if you look at the investment performance, Western, vis-à-vis certain other managers, I would say that that investment performance in conjunction with an overconcentration leaves this money in motion concept still in place. So we feel pretty good about Western's activity. The level of activity are pleased et cetera, et cetera at Western is the highest it's been in several years and we just feel very good about it."

The infrastructure, the interest in infrastructure is increasing. RARE has a unique value proposition in that it is listed infrastructure so many large institutional clients like to set it or place is side-by-side with their unlisted infrastructure exposure. So it's we see their opportunity to grow pretty significant in the years ahead. The retail space, as I mentioned, they've long had a dominant position both in Australia and Canada. And we do see an opportunity, a significant opportunity frankly in the U.S., in Europe and Asia. One of the good things is that we currently, even though we just closed last week, because they have a cross-border fund in place, we can actually get out and start marketing that now. And we've actually had a fairly significant amount of inquiry, incoming calls from clients about RARE because of the unique nature of it, the high yielding nature of it, the long dated and many cases inflations sort of protected, even though nobody thinks about inflation today there are those that are kind of a dissipating some inflation in the invasion adjusting nature of a lot of the products in which they invest.

If you actually and if you look out on the long run, they blown out dramatically. And so, I think it's Western's view and I think it's a very powerful argument that when you look at where credit spreads are vis-à-vis where anticipated or implied default rates are, spreads are very attractive and very cheap in here. And so, we would argue that there's less likelihood of spreads widening significantly from here.

I think the other part of your question, I think is very, very important. I think, in the past, Western being a heavily credit-oriented manager, during periods like we experienced during this past quarter where spreads got very choppy and widened out, I think the general consensus, the historical perspective on Western would have been gosh, they're just going to grossly underperform and the reality is, in this past order, the benchmark actually outperformed most active managers in fixed. And -- but Western, there -- Western's investment performance versus peers was very, very good. And so, I think what they've done over the last few years and we'll talk about it, but you can talk about it all you want to the was in the pudding. If you look at significant events where credit spreads have widened and where historically, you would have expected Western to underperform, in fact, there've actually performed quite well, either sort of in line with the rest of the market or with respect to this past quarter even though down versus the bench versus peers of very, very good performance. And I think that's part of what you're seeing with the consultants coming around and with the institutions coming around. They are now believing that Western has addressed sort of that high volatility component or a good part of that high volatility component with respect to how they manage money."

And I was surprised to hear that, if I heard you correctly, just because there's been such a multiyear emphasis, especially by retail investors on dividend in other income paying products. So my question is really twofold and 2 parts to it, and I think the parts are probably related. One, why do you need, if I have your comments correct, why the sudden drop in interest in income-oriented products? And relatedly, could you contrast Brandywine and ClearBridge to help us better understand why one was an outflow mode and the other in inflow mode?"

I wouldn't read too much into the fact that at ClearBridge, the outflows were largely related to income strategies. I think there's a couple of things going on there. I think one was a significant reallocation on the part of 1 sub-advisory client. And that's a tactical decision, a rebalancing or reallocation that that client made for whatever reason they made it. We continue to manage a fairly significant amount for them. So I wouldn't read too much into it. That's -- we can rebalancing. We'll talk about this in fixed income. We get rebalancing at times in fixed income and that comes out of equity and it goes back and forth. So I wouldn't read too much out of that. We saw certain retail products that weren't performing as well on the income side. We saw a significant slowdown inflows and a slight uptick in outflows there. But I wouldn't read too much into it. And I would suggest to you that actually that's -- we've seen that reverse a little bit in October, where we're seeing it was again in those income strategies, certainly the retail space at ClearBridge. As it relates to the compare and contrast from ClearBridge and Brandywine, the way I think about it is this. ClearBridge has been -- has had some significant kind of headline products or franchise-type products where flows slowed a little bit and actually slowed a little bit. Redemptions in those products really didn't significantly increase. It's just the sales did. And I attribute that largely to the market environment. And it was just a pretty darn tough market environment for advisers to be getting retail investors into the market. So we saw and those were a little bit of performance that I would say but we saw a significant slowdown in some of those franchise products at ClearBridge. And with even without it, a significant uptick in outflows, that takes your net flows out. I would say, Brandywine is a different story. We've never really marketed Brandywine in the field on the equity side. We've obviously done a lot of that on the fixed income side, but it's not really ever been on the retail equity side. A lot of the flows you're seeing -- Brandywine actually has a number of products with really terrific performance. And our quasi-institutional and sub-advisory teams have recognized that have been successful in going after some takeover opportunities at some of their larger clients. So that's what you're seeing there. You're seeing really not so much kind of the daily flows out of retail at Brandywine but some large quasi-institutional type takeover wins there with a large quasi-institutional outflow at tactically done at ClearBridge."

But in quarters like we have last quarter where revenues were down significantly, it's kind of interesting how our model is. Because when you work through the one-off items and we've got a forward on Page 17 in the deck, but if you work through those one-off items, we're pretty much were flat core earnings quarter-over-quarter about $0.68. So the spending, that workings really corporate and then kind of the nature of the revenue share model really kind of showing through here. And then another expense -- historically, we probably run more closer to $50 million per quarter again, probably 2/3 of that at affiliates and 1/3 at the parent level. I envision that kind of run rate that's going to stay down a bit for the foreseeable future until markets bring us back up from a revenue perspective, and then the things that we had at corporate again are really the deal costs and the ETF costs that will hit this next quarter.

We've really kind expand of a number of delivery approaches that we have. We added -- it's not just any more people in the field and then, internal wholesalers, but we've added over the last years across channel desk and then a call center desk. So we've added different ways to kind of go out. We've segmented the adviser probably should, which is enormous and then we've in the process of segmenting it, chosen how we want to address it, whether it's in the field directly face-to-face, whether it's more of a combination of face-to-face and phone sales through our channel team, whether is really just for that is that get us into locations where we just have very little chance of getting from a travel standpoint. I feel good about it. I'm not going to give metrics around it because those are some of internal metrics, but I feel very good about the work that's being done and the fact that we've gotten so many of these people on the lines, talking to clients, the contacts. The one thing I will tell you is the amount of contact that we are having with advisers has grown dramatically over the past year. And that's directly related to the investments that we've made, the people that we have hired, and that contact, when done on a regular basis and relationships established in tandem with the product that we have, high-quality products with great performance, that's going to yield results.

They've got a lot more runway right now it was an infrastructure. So are there opportunities for extensions into infrastructure debt or unlisted infrastructure? Sure. But I think those are down the road. I think there's a lot more runway right now with what they have.

We're optimistic that we're going to be able to get a 40 fund with their kind of signature products into the U.S. in reasonably short order, but we don't always control over that. So I think we're feeling very good about our ability to leverage them. And then I think, there's just been a lot of interest from this quasi-institutional that we have.

We do a ton of business with our legacy affiliates. Brandywine, we've highlighted that and Western. So we really think that's going to be a place where we ought to be able to get a pretty good traction pretty quickly, hopefully, with RARE and in that quasi-institutional space. So we feel pretty good about all the channels and all the opportunities.

And as always, I appreciate your time and joining us on the call today.
Markets around the world experienced a significant return to volatility during the quarter, and that certainly affected our clients, Legg Mason and our industry as a whole. Changes in how investors are thinking about equity valuations, uncertainty around the timing and impact of interest rate increases, volatility in oil and commodities and concerns about the overall global macroeconomic environment all served to create a higher degree of uneasiness, particularly with retail investors. The result of these forces was a dramatic increase in active mutual fund outflows in the U.S. totaling $103 billion, while internationally, long-term cross-border fund inflows reversed by nearly $100 billion to outflows of just over $50 billion during the quarter. Yet against this market backdrop, the increasingly diversified nature of our business was validated. Specifically, I'm pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth with positive long-term net flows of $3.1 billion and an organic growth rate of 2.2%.
Now as Pete will explain, we also experienced some nonoperating factors that adversely impacted our financials, but I am pleased with our quarterly operating performance and continued strategic progress.
Positive long-term inflows were driven largely by fixed income, though we recorded modest inflows in equities as well. Brandywine Global, QS Investors and Western Asset all have positive long-term flows for the quarter, while Martin Currie was breakeven. While gross and net sales in global distribution were down quarter-over-quarter, gross sales in our global retail platform year-to-date are actually ahead of last year. Our global retail net sales numbers, while positive, are a bit behind year-over-year.
Operating earnings and operating margins as adjusted were healthy, and our pipeline of unfunded wins remained strong at $9.4 billion at quarter's end.
Most importantly for the long run, however, we continue to diversify our affiliate mix with an expanded set of investment capabilities that, as recent markets demonstrate, are critical for our clients as they navigate market turbulence.
As you know, investor needs and preferences continue to evolve. Increasingly, investment strategies that are more flexible and outcome oriented can better address those changes. Consistent with this evolving client demand, I'm pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure on October 21, adding further strength to our investment capability in highly differentiated asset classes and strategies.
So now let's walk through the quarter.
On Slide 2, you'll see that we recorded net income of $64.3 million for the quarter or $0.58 per diluted share. We ended the quarter with $672 billion in AUM, a decrease quarter-over-quarter driven largely by market depreciation. As I mentioned, long-term net inflows were $3.1 billion. And global distribution generated quarterly gross and net sales of $18.1 billion and $500 million, respectively. We retired 1.9 million shares for $90 million. And as I noted a minute ago, we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure.
Slide 3 shows our Assets Under Management by affiliate; as well as by asset class, geography and client type. As you can see, Assets Under Management at our fixed income-oriented affiliates held up well. And with the exception of QS, which had a very strong-flow quarter, Assets Under Management at most of our equity affiliates declined, driven both by market depreciation and retail outflows.
Slide 4 shows our affiliate overview of flows and pipeline, and the $9.4 billion pipeline of unfunded wins at quarter end reflects the resiliency of our underlying business. While our growth last fiscal year was largely driven by retail flows, growth this fiscal year has been driven more by our institutional business, again demonstrating the diversification of our book of business. Now as I walk you through each affiliate, I'll touch on a few highlights for each, so let's get started.
Brandywine enjoyed very strong inflows during the quarter made up of $1.3 billion in equity and $1.5 billion in fixed income flows and leaving $4.5 billion in unfunded wins. Two takeaways: While short-term performance has been a bit challenged, Brandywine's 3-, 5- and 10-year track records remain impressive. The flows, pipeline and momentum at Brandywine has been quite strong, with the company having achieved its eighth straight quarter of positive net flows.
ClearBridge Investments experienced $1.8 billion in outflow for the quarter, reflecting both a slowing of sales and an uptick in redemptions in retail and a rebalancing in the sub-advisory channels. Quarter-end unfunded wins were $500 million. For ClearBridge, the vast majority of outflow experienced has actually been clustered in income-type strategies. However, ClearBridge is seeing significant platform and model opportunities in their high active share and international equity suite with many of our distribution partners.
Martin Currie was breakeven for the quarter and closed with $500 million in unfunded wins. Highlights include investment performance broadly improved during a tough quarter, specifically in Asia active share, equity income and European long/short. And the integration and collaboration in product transition and distribution between Martin Currie and Legg Mason is at a very high level.
Permal had $300 million in outflows and $300 million in unfunded wins for the quarter. Permal's highlights include performance year-to-date that is solid on a relative basis, though slightly negative in absolute terms. Recent retail adoption of Permal's products is encouraging with $500 million in positive flows in the China AUA strategy; a slight pickup in the U.S. liquid alts strategy and the launch of a cross-border version of the same U.S. liquid alts fund; and finally, a slowing of outflows in the European high-net-worth business that has persisted across the industry for some time.
QS Investors realized $2.8 billion in inflows for the quarter, reflecting strong interest in multi-asset products in the sub-advisory channel. There's just a lot going on right now at QS, including strong interest on the part of quasi-institutional clients and customized multi-asset class solutions; investment performance in both developed and emerging market equity strategies at QS that is very strong, representing an important growth opportunity; and the opportunity in the retail channel to get shelf space for their products on multiple distribution platforms. And important to cite, QS Investors is a critical partner for us in the continued development of next-generation products, from multi-asset class solutions, managed-volatility strategies and retail liquid alternatives. QS is also the designated manager on the 4 ETF strategies which we filed with the SEC back in September.
Royce & Associates had $2.2 billion in outflows, a modest slowing of roughly $500 million quarter-over-quarter. While we have acknowledged that this will be a long recovery for Royce, we believe in their investment process, the intellectual capital and leadership at Royce and their continued commitment to high active share with high-quality companies in their universe.
And finally, Western Asset with $1.9 billion in fixed income inflows and a pipeline of $3.6 billion in unfunded wins. 3 key highlights for Western: Western is now on the recommended list of 90% of Tier 1 consultants, up from about 20% just a year ago. Clearly related, RFP activity is strong, trending higher than last year, and it is Western's view and ours that the longer-term money-in-motion opportunity is still in play. And finally, it has certainly been a challenging 15-month period for credit, especially in this past quarter, with the benchmark outperforming many managers, including Western. That said, we're encouraged by Western's performance in high-grade and broad market portfolios versus peers during this period.
Slide 5 gives an overview of our recently closed acquisition of RARE Infrastructure. RARE is a very high-quality firm that has delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. The company has a seasoned investment team and strong institutional and retail presence in a number of markets. This acquisition is the first in which we've left equity within the affiliate, thereby better aligning the long-term interests of Legg Mason shareholders with the management team at RARE. Global listed infrastructure as an investment strategy meets client demand on multiple fronts, including growth, income and capital preservation. Now I don't want to oversell this because, like our other acquisitions, positioning a new affiliate for retail distribution takes time. However, I'd like to share 2 exciting and reinforcing notes about the acquisition.
First, despite the fact that we have not been able to solicit interest in RARE until we closed the transaction, we've received a number of inbound calls from clients interested in learning about their capabilities and products. Post close, we are now able to follow up with those clients and are obviously encouraged by their interest. We'll see what turns up from there. Second, we are able to immediately begin distributing RARE's existing cross-border funds to select European clients looking for income and yield.
Slide 6 highlights the results from our global distribution platform, which had modest net positive sales for the quarter. Our results reflect a general pullback by retail investors amidst volatility and declines in many world equity indices and markets. Our retail market share remains steady as global outflows from active funds across the industry increase significantly. Gross sales of $18.1 billion were down 8% from the year-ago period and down 5% from the prior quarter, though again, year-to-date gross sales on the platform remain ahead of last year. For the quarter, large sub-advisory wins that funded with QS and Brandywine Global were offset by outflows in retail. Net sales were also down from the prior quarter due to lower sales and higher redemption rates, generally in line with global industry trends.
Slide 7 shows investment performance. Short-term performance in some larger fixed income portfolios was challenged through September, while equity performance improved at a number of affiliates. Long-term performance remains solid, with more than 80% of strategy AUM beating benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years.
And with that, let me turn it over to Pete."

I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we were pleased to report our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows. On the earnings front, we were negatively impacted by markets, which led to a $17 billion decline in average AUM. This reduced our revenues while also negatively impacting our seed and other corporate investments, resulting in earnings of $64 million or $0.58 per share for the quarter. At a high level, our revenue decrease was primarily driven by the decline in average long-term AUM, mix and lower performance fees.
In terms of expenses, the main driver of the decline in operating expenses was the drop in compensation due to lower revenues and a reduction from last quarter's higher seasonal compensation.
All in, the net result was operating income that was $9 million greater than the prior quarter.
As for our bottom line net income, our earnings were adversely impacted by market forces on our seed and other corporate investments, not offsetting compensation, as well as the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on an Australian dollar hedge we put in place related to the RARE acquisition. The combined impact in the quarter of these 2 nonoperating items was $23 million or $0.13 per share.
Adjusted income was $99 million for the quarter or $0.89 per share. This quarter's performance fees of $8 million came from Brandywine, Martin Currie and Western. These were below our expectations as of our last call due to market headwinds which led to decreases in absolute performance, particularly at Permal and Brandywine. While it is impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million.
In terms of capital deployment, we again retired $90 million in shares during the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 9. The main item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 30.5%. This is lower than normal due to -- due largely to the finalization of open-tax year audits, which resulted in the release of certain reserves. The outlook for next quarter is a return to a GAAP effective rate of approximately 36%. And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter, we were at 6%, and for the full fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 5%, as you can see on Page 21 in the appendix. This lower cash rate is anticipated to last at least through the end of this decade based on our current estimates.
Turning to Slide 10. Our ending Assets Under Management were down 4% despite $3.1 billion in long-term inflows. The AUM decline was driven by a combination of market depreciation, FX movements and liquidity outflows, all of which totaled $30 billion. It is important to note this ending AUM number is now our starting point for fiscal Q3, which is 2 percentage points lower than our average AUM for the second fiscal quarter. This, along with asset class and product mix shifts, will negatively impact our advisory fee revenue next quarter.
On Slide 11, you can see that our long-term inflows were $3.1 billion, representing our sixth straight quarter of positive long-term flows. Fixed income inflows were $3 billion, reflecting strong demand despite market forces across a variety of our affiliates' strategies and products. Equity flows were also a positive $100 million, thanks to custom multi-asset and dynamic allocations that offset small-cap and equity income outflows.
Looking ahead, our October flows should be positive, based on what we know at the moment, driven in part by institutional fixed income wins at both Brandywine and Western across a variety of products.
You will see on Slide 10 (sic) [12] that our total operating revenue yield x performance fees declined from last quarter, primarily driven by the significant market decline in equity AUM. And here, the rounding is important, as last quarter's equity was 28.4% of our average AUM versus 27.6% for this quarter, so an 80 basis point drop but both rounding to 28%.
Operating expenses, on Slide 13, decreased by $44 million or 8% to $540 million. I'll discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items: D&S expense decreased, reflecting the significant decline in AUM due to markets. Other expenses decreased $2 million despite RARE-related acquisition costs and seasonal director fee expenses as both affiliates and LM corporate decreased their spending in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. Compensation and benefits decreased by $33 million or 10%. The primary driver behind the decline was lower compensation from revenue share affiliates due to lower revenues. Additionally, last quarter's seasonal costs of $11 million included $9 million of incremental accounting charges related to annual deferred compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 54%, in line with our 53% to 54% target for fiscal 2016.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased from last quarter's 22.6%. Last quarter's margin was impacted by the retirement-eligible accounting charges, which reduced the margin by 1.7%. Looking forward to fiscal Q3, the operating margin will be impacted by approximately $3 million in incremental spending related to the ETF launch that Joe mentioned earlier.
Moving on to Slide 16. Due to the significant impact of markets on our seed and other corporate investments this quarter, we provided this slide, which shows the changes from last quarter's nonoperating income of $6 million to this quarter's nonoperating expense of $28 million or a $34 million swing. As I mentioned earlier, due to the stronger dollar, there was an $11 million negative mark-to-market impact on an Australian dollar hedge used to lock-in the RARE purchase price. And to give you a little more color on this item: The Austrian dollar recovered in October so that, when we closed the hedge earlier this month, there was a $6.6 million positive mark, which you will see in fiscal Q3. Overall, the hedge locked-in an effective $20 million reduction in the RARE purchase price due to a stronger U.S. dollar since the signing of this deal.
The rest of this table walks you down to the mark-to-market on seed investments, not offsetting compensation, which was a negative $13 million compared with a positive of $0.5 million last quarter. In the lower left chart, you can see the market value of our seed and deferred compensation portfolio as of September 30. To the right, you can see the mark-to-market change embedded in the 3 buckets of seed investments as well as the deferred compensation component not offset in comp expense.
Slide 17 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 to this quarter's $0.58 per share. Fiscal Q1 included a tax benefit which increased our earnings per share by $0.16. For our fiscal second quarter, higher operating income and the impact of our share repurchases increased earnings per share by $0.02. The change in mark to market on our seed and corporate investments, not offsetting comp, reduced earnings per share by $0.10 quarter-over-quarter. And finally, for fiscal Q2, the combination of the RARE hedge and acquisition costs as well as the settlement of prior year tax filings combined to reduce EPS by $0.02.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 55 million shares or 34% since March 2010. In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same time frame. We now have achieved 6 straight years of increased annual dividends. And we're particularly pleased with the magnitude of those increases since 2010, which is over 600%. In total, we've returned a very robust $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders since we began our buyback program in 2010, a rate of capital return that is industry leading. I should point out that this represents half of our current market cap, and we have done this while delevering to a significant degree and making a number of strategic investments in our business.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which was up from our seasonally low first fiscal quarter. Also, it is important to note that we used $178 million of cash in closing the RARE acquisition in October. Finally on the bottom right, you can see the mix of our $326 million in seed investments. 
So thank you for your time and for your interest in Legg Mason. Now we'll turn it back to Joe."

We believe that it is working and that it will result in long-ter",807,"Thanks, Pete.
Our job every day is to navigate markets to the benefit of our clients and shareholders, and we remain confident in the strategic plan we have executed over the past 3 years. We believe that it is working and that it will result in long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.
So before we take questions, let me leave you with what we see as the 5 key takeaways for Legg Mason from today. First, we delivered solid operating performance in a challenging market environment. Market forces certainly affected our earnings per share, but even with lower revenues, we're pleased with both our operating earnings and margins as adjusted.
Next, Legg Mason continues to grow organically, and we enjoy a strong new business pipeline. This was our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows, an organic growth rate of 2.2%. We have a strong lineup of investment affiliates in place: smart, experienced, capable people who can deliver for our clients through market cycles. Our ""won but not yet funded"" pipeline is over $9 billion, reflecting especially solid demand at Brandywine Global and Western Asset. The interest generated by QS Investors, now in their second year as a Legg Mason affiliate, has exceeded expectations. And we expect to translate that momentum to our DCIO sales channel over time. Across our retail platform, we see opportunities building in equity strategies at ClearBridge and Martin Currie and alternative strategies from Permal. Finally, we believe that the RARE Infrastructure acquisition can now be another engine of differentiated growth for Legg Mason.
Three, Legg Mason is well positioned for a normalized rate environment, whenever that time comes. The Fed has reiterated that they expect to raise rates later this year; and that it will be a gradual, data-dependent process. We are ready for that increase whenever it comes, but that's not the main event for bond markets right now. With a subdued inflation outlook and moderate growth, bond yields are likely to remain relatively low for an extended period of time. The relative performance of our fixed income platform is what matters. We have a high degree of confidence in the excellence of Brandywine Global and Western Asset Management, 2 premiere fixed income managers with enviable investment track records over many market cycles.
The institutional nature of our fixed income book of business, currently around 90% of the total, should also prove more resilient as rates rise. We believe that our recent institutional fixed income flows support this view. Institutional flows at Brandywine and Western were quite solid in what was a very volatile market environment. For some of our equity managers, which tend to be more quality focused, a Fed rate hike should also benefit their performance and our clients, as a normalized rate environment should reduce correlations and create opportunities for high-quality active managers such as Royce, Martin Currie and Permal. From our standpoint, a normalized rate environment can't come fast enough.
Four, strategic opportunities to diversify our business are abundant. First of all, we are very pleased with our recent acquisitions. The market for M&A is strengthening, and Legg Mason is increasingly seen as an acquirer of choice. With regard to future acquisitions, we continue to think about how to fill remaining product gaps, including energy, private equity and real estate. We have been very active in product development, launching more than 23 new absolute-return and unconstrained next-generation products over the past 2 years. We are in a much stronger position to serve the varying needs of our clients and deliver for shareholders than we were only 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp up product development and shelf space for QS Investors and Martin Currie. Last week, we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure whose products can help us further meet important client demands for income, capital preservation and diversification. RARE has a long track record of success in early-adopter markets such as Australia and Canada. And we believe global demand for their liquid, long-dated assets will grow in the U.S., on the continent and in Asia where we have strong distribution capability. And as for our much-anticipated initial ETF efforts, our legal and product teams are working with the SEC and The Street to launch an initial set of strategies soon. I look forward to updating you as that initiative progresses.
And finally, we remain committed to thoughtful capital deployment. We have pledged to balance growth investments with dividends and share repurchases, and we've done that. Ultimately, our goal is to further leverage Legg Mason's global scale while continuing to diversify the business, and we're succeeding.
We remain confident that our shareholders will benefit as we execute on growth, diversification and profitability. We have more opportunity before us and more work to do.
And with all that said, I am happy to take your questions."

So I -- we are pleased during the past quarter and, frankly, on an ongoing basis with what we see in terms of the institutional business for both Brandywine and Western. But with respect to both of them, we saw a significant amount of industry outflow on the taxable side, roughly, I think, $45 billion or so, during the quarter. Western was out, I think, $200 million; Brandywine out a bit more, maybe around $500 million, so very modest outflow there. We do believe that we are below what should be an appropriate market share for us in taxable fixed income with Western. And you're exactly right. Given the performance, we should and we do expect to pick up market share in taxables with retail as we go forward. Actually, among our -- you'll notice, if you look back on our Slide 6, Western Asset Core Plus in terms of bond funds was our largest -- has been our largest seller in terms of the retail side. So we are looking forward to growing our market share. We have seen inflows month-to-date in retail at Western.

So just again at a high level, for October, we still have today to go and things can happen. And we always need to sort of true-up across the global organization for a few days after the month ends, but I would tell you that, for October, with what we're seeing right now, we've got a very solid flow month in place. Equities look to be close to breakeven. Fixed income looks to be strongly positive. As Pete mentioned in his remarks, those are largely institutional fixed income wins at both Brandywine and Western but, as I mentioned, Western's positive retail as well. And then our unfunded pipe for the -- as of the end of October looks to be very, very strong. As for Permal, their business continues to be -- they continue to be largely institutional. We did see a slight slowing in the outflow from the European high-net-worth business. I don't want to overstate that, but it was a nice reversal a little bit, a slowing in that trend. We're actually hoping to go after the European retail business with the launch of our liquid alternatives fund, the -- really the bloop [ph] in the cross-border space. It's really a clone of the U.S. strategy we have. So we've seen outflow over the last several years from the European high-net-worth space. We think we can go after some of that money with our new cross-border fund there. We've also -- we also had just very significant performance with Permal on the flow side out of China during the second quarter, where that strategy, which as you remember, is an AUA strategy. It has characteristics, fee characteristics that are attractive, but it's technically classified as AUA. We saw about, I think, $700 million in flows into that strategy. That strategy performed well from an investment performance standpoint. And we saw really nice flows. That fund now is up over $2 billion. But all that said, Permal has continued to evolve increasingly to the institutional side of the business, but we are -- they are working to continue building out the retail space. We've seen a small pickup in U.S. retail in Permal's strategies, so that's been encouraging, small pickup there. We're hopeful of a similar pickup in Europe and then strong in the retail side with our distribution partner in China. So I think that wraps it."

I mean that was a couple of very significant wins which we have been calling out. That said, there's a couple of things going on. One, the interest in QS, as I mentioned, is very, very strong. This highly customized multi-asset-class opportunity is really in the sweet spot of larger kind of insurance sub-advisory demand right now. They do have, I think, about -- in this month of $300 million or so in won and funded wins, so even though they don't show up as unfunded, they actually funded in this month. But -- and that -- I think that was in the small-cap space, which was a nice win for us because that's actually part -- goes back to part of a legacy Batterymarch strategy, which is performing very, very well. You'll also want to remember that we have been very successful in getting QS on a number of platforms. Those don't necessarily come with takeover AUM, but they give you an opportunity for just consistent, steady flow. And I think we've got them on upwards of 10 different platforms over the last year. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, QS is going to be the manager for our smart beta strategies which we hope to launch at the end of this year or early next year. So the interest and activity level at QS is extraordinarily high. And in addition, just in terms of sort of product development, QS is working actually very closely with a number of our other affiliates in looking at sort of multi-asset-class active strategies where they can capitalize on Brandywine or Western Asset or ClearBridge and putting those together. So the strong interest in what QS does; strong activity, strong results, I would say; and just a really good feeling about what they're doing."

I'll let Pete maybe try to take a wag on the fee rate a little bit, but the way I think about it is that you're right. I mean we've seen some choppiness in performance in the last few months and couple of quarters, but if you look really at the 3 year or 5 year, which is where most clients really look, overall the performance across the platform remains very, very strong. We know that Royce has been challenged, but aside from Royce, our equity and fixed income performance is just really strong. We saw meaningful improvement, I would say, overall in our equity strategies towards the end of the last quarter. We saw improvement at Royce actually. We saw improvement at ClearBridge, with appreciation on large-cap value. Brandywine, their diversified large-cap value strategy, we saw a nice improvement in performance there. Martin Currie had a significant improvement in 1-year performance predominately out of their European and China strategies. And then QS, their strategies, particularly the legacy developed market strategies, are just performing at a very, very high level. I think, again if you look at the 3, 5s and 10s for Western, they're north of 80% of strategies, beating their benchmarks. So we feel good about the longer-term 3-, 5-, 10-year. We've had some choppiness and up-and-down in the short term, but clients tend to look through that a little bit, which is why you're continuing to see fundings. Now in terms of sort of the unfunded wins at Brandywine, for example, you're seeing unfunded wins largely in opportunistic fixed income, in corporate debt and then in large-cap equity. At Western, it's really corporate debt, high yield, more broad -- and broader market strategies. And then -- but on the equity side and some of the unfunded wins, both ClearBridge and Martin Currie have ended the quarter with unfunded wins around the $500 million area. In the case of Martin Currie, that was really around regional equity and emerging market equity. And ClearBridge, their unfundeds really were around Aggressive Growth and equity income. Pete, do you want to maybe talk to Mike a little bit about how you see the fee rate from all of that soup that I just put together?"

And it obviously severely impacted not just us but everybody else's portfolios. And equity assets are going to be returning a bit more than fixed, clearly, but a lot more than liquidity. But it -- we've recovered probably half of that due to the market rebound in October. And then when you look at the underlying trends, particularly in our fixed income business, there's really a trade going on between lower fee outflows and higher fee inflows from specialized products that's really becoming much more pronounced. The other thing that was going on -- you asked a bit about retail and institutional [indiscernible] our global distribution businesses actually had 8 straight quarters of inflows, and again, that tends to be of higher fees. So the underlying trends are pretty positive overall despite the blip that was caused by the market this last month."

And I -- as I said in the prepared remarks, that's up really from 20%, I think, 14 months ago. So you've seen a significant turnaround there. Now obviously, consultants have a significant and huge influence over institutional flows, and we're seeing that play right into the level of activity, the RFP activity at Western, which is running reasonably ahead of last year, which is good. And then I mentioned on one of my comments that Western believes, and we do as well, that this sort of money-in-motion opportunity continues to be real. It's going to take time. And I can't -- we're not really pulling it out anymore, but we are seeing RFP activity. And in some cases, simply we've actually seen some modest takeovers without even RFPs that are really directly tied to sort of money in motion. So with all that's going on, and if you look at investment performance, Western vis-à-vis certain other managers, I would say that, that investment performance in conjunction with an overconcentration leaves this money-in-motion concept still in place. So we feel pretty good about Western's activity. The level of activity, RFPs et cetera et cetera, at Western is the highest it's been in several years, and we just feel very good about it."

I just actually spent some time with Nick Langley, co-CEO from RARE, earlier in the week, and we talked about sort of their activity level. And he was recounting for me the number of different institutional clients globally that they're engaged with, talking about opportunities. The infrastructure -- the interest in infrastructure is increasing. RARE has a unique value proposition in that it is listed infrastructure. So many large institutional clients like to kind of set it or place it side-by-side with their unlisted infrastructure exposure, so it's we see their opportunity to grow institutionally pretty significant in the years ahead. The retail space, as I mentioned, they've long had a dominant position both in Australia and Canada. And we do see an opportunity, a significant opportunity, frankly, in the U.S. and Europe and Asia. One of the good things is that we currently -- even though we just closed last week, because they have a cross-border fund in place, we can actually get out and start marketing that now. And we've actually had a fairly significant amount of inquiry, incoming calls from clients about RARE because of the unique nature of it: the high-yielding nature of it; the long dated, in many cases; inflation sort of protected, even though nobody thinks about inflation today, there are those that are kind of anticipating someday inflation; and the inflation-adjusting nature of a lot of the products in which they invest. So we just think there is tremendous enthusiasm internally but also among clients about the potential to extend RARE's capabilities into the retail space and their continued expansion on the institutional side. Pete, I'll let you talk about some of the items."

I'd say less than half of that will be kind of run rate kind of things going forward, so there'll be a little over half that are truly onetime costs. And then RARE, RARE will be marginally accretive. We're pretty much going to offset a good bit of those incremental costs with earnings from RARE in the quarter. And obviously, we expect that business to build. Given their performance, given the high demand in that product area, we'd expect their earnings to ramp up pretty nicely for us as we go forward and particularly once we get it hooked into global distribution."

I would tell you that we've actually been in a bear market for credit over the last 15 months or so. And if you go back and look at where credit sped -- credit spreads actually were at their narrow, it would have been in the spring of 2014. And since that time, we've seen credit spreads widen fairly dramatically. And we saw that again during this past quarter. We saw spreads widen. If you actually and if you look out on the long end, they've blown out dramatically. And so I think it's Western's view, and I think it's a very powerful argument, that when you look at where credit spreads are vis-à-vis where anticipated or implied default rates are, spreads are actually very attractive and very cheap in here. And so we would argue that there's less likelihood of spreads widening significantly from here. And if anything, I would argue -- or I don't want to speak for Western because I'm not the CIO, but I would argue that, if the economy strengthens at all, there is room given how -- given the fact we've been in a bear market for credit over the last 15 months or so, I would argue that there's actually an opportunity for credit spreads to tighten. I think the -- but the other part of your question, I think, is very, very important. I think, in the past, Western being a heavily credit-oriented manager, during periods like we experienced during this past quarter where spreads got very choppy and widened out, I think the general consensus, the historical perspective on Western would have been, ""Gosh, they're just going to grossly underperform."" And the reality is, in this past quarter, the benchmark actually outperformed most active managers in fixed. And -- but Western, in their -- Western's investment performance versus peers was very, very good. And so I think what they've done over the last few years, and we've talked about it -- but you can talk about it all you want. The proof is in the pudding. If you look at significant events where credit spreads have widened and where historically you would have expected Western to underperform, in fact, they've actually performed quite well, either sort of in line with the rest of the market; or with respect to this past quarter, even though down versus the bench versus peers, a very, very good performance. And I think that's part of what you're seeing with the consultants coming around and with the institutions coming around. They are now believing that Western has addressed sort of that high-volatility component or a good part of that high-volatility component to -- with respect to how they manage money."

And I was surprised to hear that, if I heard you correctly, just because there has been such a multiyear emphasis, especially by retail investors, on dividend and other income-paying products. So my question is really twofold and 2 parts to it. And I think the parts are probably related. One, why the -- if I had your comments correct, why the sudden drop in interest in income-oriented products? And relatedly, could you contrast Brandywine and ClearBridge to help us better understand why one was in outflow mode and the other in inflow mode?"

I wouldn't read too much into the fact that at ClearBridge the outflows were largely related to income strategies. I think there's a couple of things going on there. I think one was a significant reallocation on the part of one sub-advisory client. And; that's a tactical decision, a rebalancing or reallocation that, that client made for whatever reason they made it. We continue to manage a fairly significant amount for them. So I wouldn't read too much into it. That's we get rebalancings, we have talked about this, in fixed income. We get rebalancings at times in fixed income, and that comes out of equity. And it goes back and forth, so I wouldn't read too much out of that. We saw certain retail products that weren't performing as well. On the income side, we saw a significant slowdown in flows; and a slight uptick in outflows there, but I wouldn't read too much into it. And I would suggest to you that actually that's we've seen that reverse a little bit in October, where we're seeing interest again in those income strategies, certainly in the retail space, at ClearBridge. As it relates to the compare and contrast from ClearBridge and Brandywine, the way I think about it is this: ClearBridge has been -- has had some significant kind of headline products or franchise-type products where flows slowed a little bit and actually sales slowed a little bit. Redemptions in those products really didn't significantly increase. It's just the sales did. And I attribute that largely to the market environment. I mean it was just a pretty darn tough market environment for advisers to be getting retail investors into the market. So we saw -- and there was a little bit of performance there, I would say, but we saw a significant slowdown in some of those franchise products at ClearBridge; and with -- even without it, a significant uptick in outflows that just takes your net flows out. I would say Brandywine is a different story. We've never really marketed Brandywine in the field on the equity side. We've obviously done a lot of that on the fixed income side, but it's not really ever been on the retail equity side. A lot of the flows you're seeing -- Brandywine actually has a number of equity products with really terrific performance. And our quasi-institutional and insurance sub-advisory teams have recognized that and have been successful in going after and -- some takeover opportunities at some of their larger clients. So that's what you're seeing there. You're seeing it really in not so much kind of the daily flows out of retail at Brandywine but some large quasi-institutional-type takeover wins there, with a large quasi-institutional outflow at -- tactically done at ClearBridge."

But in terms of discretionary spending, keep in mind that about 2/3 of the spending is at affiliates, where whatever they don't spend on space or travel or whatever goes into their bonus pool, but in quarters like we had last quarter where revenues were down significantly, it's kind of interesting how self-correcting our model is. Because when you work through the one-off items -- and we've got a rollforward on Page 17 in the deck, but if you work through those one-off items, we pretty much were flat core earnings quarter-over-quarter at about $0.68. So the discretionary spending that we're controlling are in corporate, and then kind of the self-correcting nature of the revenue share model really kind of showing through here. And then on other expense, historically, we've probably run more closer to $50 million per quarter, again probably 2/3 of that at the affiliates and 1/3 at the parent level. I'd envision, that kind of run rate, that's going to stay down a bit for the foreseeable future until markets bring us back up from a revenue perspective. And then the things that we had at corporate, again, are really the deal costs and the ETF costs that will hit this next quarter. Does that help?"

And we really -- our approach within our distribution platform is really around solution selling. And I know that, that is a bit of a buzzword, but that's really the way we approach it.

We've really kind of expanded the number of delivery approaches that we have. We added -- it's not just anymore people in the field and then internal wholesalers, but we've added, over the last few years, a cross-channel desk and then a call center desk. So we've added different ways to kind of go out. We've segmented the adviser population, which is enormous. And then we've, in the process of segmenting it, chosen how we want to address it, whether it's in the field directly face-to-face, whether it's more of a combination of face-to-face and phone sales through our cross-channel team, whether it's really just phone touches that get us into locations where we just have very little chance of getting from a travel standpoint. I feel good about it. I'm not going to give metrics around it because those are sort of internal metrics, but I feel very good about the work that's being done; and the fact that we've gotten so many of these people on the lines, talking to clients, to contacts. The one thing I will tell you is the amount of contact that we are having with advisers has grown dramatically over the past year. And that's directly related to the investments that we've made, the people that we've hired. And that contact, when done on a regular basis and relationships established, in tandem with the products that we have, high-quality products with great performance, those -- that's going to yield results.

They've got a lot more runway right now in listed infrastructure. So are there opportunities for extensions into infrastructure debt or unlisted infrastructure? Sure, but I think those are down the road. I think there's a lot more runway right now with what they have.

We're in -- we're optimistic that we're going to be able to get a 40 Act fund with their kind of signature products into the U.S. in reasonably short order, but we don't always control all of that. So I think we're feeling very good about our ability to leverage them. And then I think there's just been a lot of interest from this quasi-institutional penetration that we have.

And as always, I appreciate your time and joining us on the call today.
Markets around the world experienced a significant return to volatility during the quarter, and that certainly affected our clients, Legg Mason and our industry as a whole. Changes in how investors are thinking about equity valuations, uncertainty around the timing and impact of interest rate increases, volatility in oil and commodities and concerns about the overall global macroeconomic environment all served to create a higher degree of uneasiness, particularly with retail investors. The result of these forces was a dramatic increase in active mutual fund outflows in the U.S. totaling $103 billion, while internationally, long-term cross-border fund inflows reversed by nearly $100 billion to outflows of just over $50 billion during the quarter. Yet against this market backdrop, the increasingly diversified nature of our business was validated. Specifically, I'm pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth with positive long-term net flows of $3.1 billion and an organic growth rate of 2.2%.
Now as Pete will explain, we also experienced some nonoperating factors that adversely impacted our financials, but I am pleased with our quarterly operating performance and continued strategic progress.
Positive long-term inflows were driven largely by fixed income, though we recorded modest inflows in equities as well. Brandywine Global, QS Investors and Western Asset all had positive long-term flows for the quarter, while Martin Currie was breakeven. While gross and net sales in global distribution were down quarter-over-quarter, gross sales in our global retail platform year-to-date are actually ahead of last year. Our global retail net sales numbers, while positive, are a bit behind year-over-year.
Operating earnings and operating margins as adjusted were healthy, and our pipeline of unfunded wins remained strong at $9.4 billion at quarter's end.
Most importantly for the long run, however, we continue to diversify our affiliate mix with an expanded set of investment capabilities that, as recent markets demonstrate, are critical for our clients as they navigate market turbulence.
As you know, investor needs and preferences continue to evolve. Increasingly, investment strategies that are more flexible and outcome oriented can better address those changes. Consistent with this evolving client demand, I'm pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure on October 21, adding further strength to our investment capability in highly differentiated asset classes and strategies.
So now let's walk through the quarter.
On Slide 2, you'll see that we recorded net income of $64.3 million for the quarter or $0.58 per diluted share. We ended the quarter with $672 billion in AUM, a decrease quarter-over-quarter, driven largely by market depreciation. As I mentioned, long-term net inflows were $3.1 billion. And global distribution generated quarterly gross and net sales of $18.1 billion and $500 million, respectively. We retired 1.9 million shares for $90 million. And as I noted a minute ago, we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure.
Slide 3 shows our Assets Under Management by affiliate, as well as by asset class, geography and client type. As you can see, Assets Under Management at our fixed income-oriented affiliates held up well. And with the exception of QS, which had a very strong-flow quarter, Assets Under Management at most of our equity affiliates declined, driven both by market depreciation and retail outflows.
Slide 4 shows our affiliate overview of flows and pipeline, and the $9.4 billion pipeline of unfunded wins at quarter-end reflects the resiliency of our underlying business. While our growth last fiscal year was largely driven by retail flows, growth this fiscal year has been driven more by our institutional business, again demonstrating the diversification of our book of business. Now as I walk you through each affiliate, I'll touch on a few highlights for each, so let's get started.
Brandywine enjoyed very strong inflows during the quarter, made up of $1.3 billion in equity and $1.5 billion in fixed income flows and leaving $4.5 billion in unfunded wins. Two takeaways: While short-term performance has been a bit challenged, Brandywine's 3-, 5- and 10-year track records remain impressive. The flows, pipeline and momentum at Brandywine has been quite strong, with the company having achieved its eighth straight quarter of positive net flows.
ClearBridge Investments experienced $1.8 billion in outflow for the quarter, reflecting both a slowing of sales and an uptick in redemptions in retail and a rebalancing in the sub-advisory channels. Quarter-end unfunded wins were $500 million. For ClearBridge, the vast majority of outflow experienced has actually been clustered in income-type strategies. However, ClearBridge is seeing significant platform and model opportunities in their high active share and international equity suite with many of our distribution partners.
Martin Currie was breakeven for the quarter and closed with $500 million in unfunded wins. Highlights include investment performance broadly improved during a tough quarter, specifically in Asia active share, equity income and European long/short. And the integration and collaboration in product transition and distribution between Martin Currie and Legg Mason is at a very high level.
Permal had $300 million in outflows and $300 million in unfunded wins for the quarter. Permal's highlights include performance year-to-date that is solid on a relative basis, though slightly negative in absolute terms. Recent retail adoption of Permal's products is encouraging, with $500 million in positive flows in the China AUA strategy; a slight pickup in the U.S. liquid alts strategy and the launch of a cross-border version of the same U.S. liquid alts fund; and finally, a slowing of outflows in the European high-net-worth business that has persisted across the industry for some time.
QS Investors realized $2.8 billion in inflows for the quarter, reflecting strong interest in multi-asset products in the sub-advisory channel. There's just a lot going on right now at QS, including strong interest on the part of quasi-institutional clients in customized multi-asset class solutions; investment performance in both developed and emerging market equity strategies at QS that is very strong, representing an important growth opportunity; and the opportunity in the retail channel to get shelf space for their products on multiple distribution platforms. An important aside, QS Investors is a critical partner for us in the continued development of next-generation products, from multi-asset class solutions, managed-volatility strategies and retail liquid alternatives. QS is also the designated manager on the 4 ETF strategies which we filed with the SEC back in September.
Royce & Associates had $2.2 billion in outflows, a modest slowing of roughly $500 million quarter-over-quarter. While we have acknowledged that this will be a long recovery for Royce, we believe in their investment process, the intellectual capital and leadership at Royce and their continued commitment to high active share with high-quality companies in their universe.
And finally, Western Asset with $1.9 billion in fixed income inflows and a pipeline of $3.6 billion in unfunded wins. 3 key highlights for Western: Western is now on the recommended list of 90% of Tier 1 consultants, up from about 20% just a year ago. Clearly related, RFP activity is strong, trending higher than last year, and it is Western's view and ours that the longer-term money-in-motion opportunity is still in play. And finally, it has certainly been a challenging 15-month period for credit, especially in this past quarter, with the benchmark outperforming many managers, including Western. That said, we're encouraged by Western's performance in high-grade and broad market portfolios versus peers during this period.
Slide 5 gives an overview of our recently closed acquisition of RARE Infrastructure. RARE is a very high-quality firm that has delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. The company has a seasoned investment team and strong institutional and retail presence in a number of markets. This acquisition is the first in which we've left equity within the affiliate, thereby better aligning the long-term interests of Legg Mason shareholders with the management team at RARE. Global listed infrastructure as an investment strategy meets client demand on multiple fronts, including growth, income and capital preservation. Now I don't want to oversell this because, like our other acquisitions, positioning a new affiliate for retail distribution takes time. However, I'd like to share 2 exciting and reinforcing notes about the acquisition.
First, despite the fact that we have not been able to solicit interest in RARE until we closed the transaction, we've received a number of inbound calls from clients interested in learning about their capabilities and products. Post close, we are now able to follow up with those clients and are obviously encouraged by their interest. We'll see what turns up from there. Second, we are able to immediately begin distributing RARE's existing cross-border funds to select European clients looking for income and yield.
Slide 6 highlights the results from our global distribution platform, which had modest net positive sales for the quarter. Our results reflect a general pullback by retail investors amidst volatility and declines in many world equity indices and markets. Our retail market share remains steady as global outflows from active funds across the industry increase significantly. Gross sales of $18.1 billion were down 8% from the year-ago period and down 5% from the prior quarter, though again, year-to-date gross sales on the platform remain ahead of last year. For the quarter, large sub-advisory wins that funded with QS and Brandywine Global were offset by outflows in retail. Net sales were also down from the prior quarter due to lower sales and higher redemption rates, generally in line with global industry trends.
Slide 7 shows investment performance. Short-term performance in some larger fixed-income portfolios was challenged through September, while equity performance improved at a number of affiliates. Long-term performance remains solid, with more than 80% of strategy AUM beating benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years.
And with that, let me turn it over to Pete."
180481,314065733,887347,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe.I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we were pleased to report our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows. On the earnings front, we were negatively impacted by markets, which led to a $17 billi",1468,"Thanks, Joe.
I'll pick up on Slide 8. Despite the industry headwinds Joe mentioned earlier, we were pleased to report our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows. On the earnings front, we were negatively impacted by markets, which led to a $17 billion decline in average AUM. This reduced our revenues while also negatively impacting our seed and other corporate investments, resulting in earnings of $64 million or $0.58 per share for the quarter. At a high level, our revenue decrease was primarily driven by the decline in average long-term AUM, mix and lower performance fees.
In terms of expenses, the main driver of the decline in operating expenses was the drop in compensation due to lower revenues and a reduction from last quarter's higher seasonal compensation.
All in, the net result was operating income that was $9 million greater than the prior quarter.
As for our bottom line net income, our earnings were adversely impacted by market forces on our seed and other corporate investments, not offsetting compensation, as well as the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on an Australian dollar hedge we put in place related to the RARE acquisition. The combined impact in the quarter of these 2 nonoperating items was $23 million or $0.13 per share.
Adjusted income was $99 million for the quarter or $0.89 per share. This quarter's performance fees of $8 million came from Brandywine, Martin Currie and Western. These were below our expectations as of our last call due to market headwinds which led to decreases in absolute performance, particularly at Permal and Brandywine. While it is impossible to predict with any precision, we estimate that next quarter's performance fees could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million.
In terms of capital deployment, we again retired $90 million in shares during the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 9. The main item to highlight here is our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 30.5%. This is lower than normal due to -- due largely to the finalization of open tax-year audits, which resulted in the release of certain reserves. The outlook for next quarter is a return to a GAAP effective rate of approximately 36%. And as we have consistently highlighted, our actual cash tax rate continues to run at a substantially lower level than our GAAP rate. Specifically for this quarter, we were at 6%, and for the full fiscal year, we expect a cash tax rate of 5%, as you can see on Page 21 in the appendix. This lower cash rate is anticipated to last at least through the end of this decade based on our current estimates.
Turning to Slide 10. Our ending Assets Under Management were down 4% despite $3.1 billion in long-term inflows. The AUM decline was driven by a combination of market depreciation, FX movements and liquidity outflows, all of which totaled $30 billion. It is important to note this ending AUM number is now our starting point for fiscal Q3, which is 2 percentage points lower than our average AUM for the second fiscal quarter. This, along with asset class and product mix shifts, will negatively impact our advisory fee revenue next quarter.
On Slide 11, you can see that our long-term inflows were $3.1 billion, representing our sixth straight quarter of positive long-term flows. Fixed income inflows were $3 billion, reflecting strong demand despite market forces across a variety of our affiliates' strategies and products. Equity flows were also a positive $100 million, thanks to custom multi-asset and dynamic allocations that offset small-cap and equity income outflows.
Looking ahead, our October flows should be positive, based on what we know at the moment, driven in part by institutional fixed income wins at both Brandywine and Western across a variety of products.
You will see on Slide 10 (sic) [ 12 ] that our total operating revenue yield, ex performance fees, declined from last quarter, primarily driven by the significant market decline in equity AUM. And here, the rounding is important, as last quarter's equity was 28.4% of our average AUM versus 27.6% for this quarter, so an 80 basis point drop but both rounding to 28%.
Operating expenses, on Slide 13, decreased by $44 million or 8% to $540 million. I'll discuss comp and benefits on the next slide, but looking at the other line items: D&S expense decreased, reflecting the significant decline in AUM due to markets. Other expenses decreased $2 million despite RARE-related acquisition costs and seasonal director fee expenses as both affiliates and LM corporate decreased their spending in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. Compensation and benefits decreased by $33 million or 10%. The primary driver behind the decline was lower compensation from revenue share affiliates due to lower revenues. Additionally, last quarter's seasonal costs of $11 million included $9 million of incremental accounting charges related to annual deferred compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees. The compensation and benefits ratio came in at 54%, in line with our 53% to 54% target for fiscal 2016.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased from last quarter's 22.6%. Last quarter's margin was impacted by the retirement-eligible accounting charges, which reduced the margin by 1.7%. Looking forward to fiscal Q3, the operating margin will be impacted by approximately $3 million in incremental spending related to the ETF launch that Joe mentioned earlier.
Moving on to Slide 16. Due to the significant impact of markets on our seed and other corporate investments this quarter, we provided this slide, which shows the changes from last quarter's nonoperating income of $6 million to this quarter's nonoperating expense of $28 million or a $34 million swing. As I mentioned earlier, due to the stronger dollar, there was an $11 million negative mark-to-market impact on an Australian dollar hedge used to lock-in the RARE purchase price. And to give you a little more color on this item: The Austrian dollar recovered in October, so that when we closed the hedge earlier this month, there was a $6.6 million positive mark, which you will see in fiscal Q3. Overall, the hedge locked in an effective $20 million reduction in the RARE purchase price due to a stronger U.S. dollar since the signing of this deal.
The rest of this table walks you down to the mark-to-market on seed investments, not offsetting compensation, which was a negative $13 million compared with a positive of $0.5 million last quarter. In the lower left chart, you can see the market value of our seed and deferred compensation portfolio as of September 30. To the right, you can see the mark-to-market change embedded in the 3 buckets of seed investments as well as the deferred compensation component not offset in comp expense.
Slide 17 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 to this quarter's $0.58 per share. Fiscal Q1 included a tax benefit which increased our earnings per share by $0.16. For our fiscal second quarter, higher operating income and the impact of our share repurchases increased earnings per share by $0.02. The change in mark to market on our seed and corporate investments, not offsetting comp, reduced earnings per share by $0.10 quarter-over-quarter. And finally, for fiscal Q2, the combination of the RARE hedge and acquisition costs as well as the settlement of prior year tax filings combined to reduce EPS by $0.02.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which highlights our quarterly cash position as well as our consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment. In the upper left, you can see that we have steadily reduced our share count by 55 million shares or 34% since March 2010. In the upper right, we've highlighted the change in our quarterly dividend over the same time frame. We now have achieved 6 straight years of increased annual dividends. And we're particularly pleased with the magnitude of those increases since 2010, which is over 600%. In total, we've returned a very robust $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders since we began our buyback program in 2010, a rate of capital return that is industry leading. I should point out that this represents half of our current market cap, and we have done this while delevering to a significant degree and making a number of strategic investments in our business.
On the bottom left, you can see our cash position, which was up from our seasonally low first fiscal quarter. Also, it is important to note that we used $178 million of cash in closing the RARE acquisition in October. Finally on the bottom right, you can see the mix of our $326 million in seed investments. 
So thank you for your time and for your interest in Legg Mason. Now we'll turn it back to Joe."

Our job every day is to navigate markets to the benefit of our clients and shareholders, and we remain confident in the strategic plan we have executed over the past 3 years. We believe that it is working and that it will result in long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.
So before we take questions, let me leave you with what we see as the 5 key takeaways for Legg Mason from today. First, we delivered solid operating performance in a challenging market environment. Market forces certainly affected our earnings per share, but even with lower revenues, we're pleased with both our operating earnings and margins as adjusted.
Next, Legg Mason continues to grow organically, and we enjoy a strong new business pipeline. This was our sixth straight quarter of long-term inflows, an organic growth rate of 2.2%. We have a strong lineup of investment affiliates in place: smart, experienced, capable people who can deliver for our clients through market cycles. Our ""won but not yet funded"" pipeline is over $9 billion, reflecting especially solid demand at Brandywine Global and Western Asset. The interest generated by QS Investors, now in their second year as a Legg Mason affiliate, has exceeded expectations. And we expect to translate that momentum to our DCIO sales channel over time. Across our retail platform, we see opportunities building in equity strategies at ClearBridge and Martin Currie and alternative strategies from Permal. Finally, we believe that the RARE Infrastructure acquisition can now be another engine of differentiated growth for Legg Mason.
Three, Legg Mason is well positioned for a normalized rate environment, whenever that time comes. The Fed has reiterated that they expect to raise rates later this year, and that it will be a gradual, data-dependent process. We are ready for that increase whenever it comes, but that's not the main event for bond markets right now. With a subdued inflation outlook and moderate growth, bond yields are likely to remain relatively low for an extended period of time. The relative performance of our fixed income platform is what matters. We have a high degree of confidence in the excellence of Brandywine Global and Western Asset Management, 2 premiere fixed income managers with enviable investment track records over many market cycles.
The institutional nature of our fixed income book of business, currently around 90% of the total, should also prove more resilient as rates rise. We believe that our recent institutional fixed income flows support this view. Institutional flows at Brandywine and Western were quite solid in what was a very volatile market environment. For some of our equity managers, which tend to be more quality focused, a Fed rate hike should also benefit their performance and our clients, as a normalized rate environment should reduce correlations and create opportunities for high-quality active managers such as Royce, Martin Currie and Permal. From our standpoint, a normalized rate environment can't come fast enough.
Four, strategic opportunities to diversify our business are abundant. First of all, we are very pleased with our recent acquisitions. The market for M&A is strengthening, and Legg Mason is increasingly seen as an acquirer of choice. With regard to future acquisitions, we continue to think about how to fill remaining product gaps, including energy, private equity and real estate. We have been very active in product development, launching more than 23 new absolute-return and unconstrained next-generation products over the past 2 years. We are in a much stronger position to serve the varying needs of our clients and deliver for shareholders than we were only 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp up product development and shelf space for QS Investors and Martin Currie. Last week, we closed the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, whose products can help us further meet important client demands for income, capital preservation and diversification. RARE has a long track record of success in early-adopter markets such as Australia and Canada. And we believe global demand for their liquid, long-dated assets will grow in the U.S., on the continent and in Asia, where we have strong distribution capability. And as for our much-anticipated initial ETF efforts, our legal and product teams are working with the SEC and The Street to launch an initial set of strategies soon. I look forward to updating you as that initiative progresses.
And finally, we remain committed to thoughtful capital deployment. We have pledged to balance growth investments with dividends and share repurchases, and we've done that. Ultimately, our goal is to further leverage Legg Mason's global scale while continuing to diversify the business, and we're succeeding.
We remain confident that our shareholders will benefit as we execute on growth, diversification and profitability. We have more opportunity before us and more work to do.
And with all that said, I am happy to take your questions."

So I -- we are pleased during the past quarter and, frankly, on an ongoing basis with what we see in terms of the institutional business for both Brandywine and Western. But with respect to both of them, we saw a significant amount of industry outflow on the taxable side, roughly, I think, $45 billion or so, during the quarter. Western was out, I think, $200 million; Brandywine out a bit more, maybe around $500 million, so very modest outflow there. We do believe that we are below what should be an appropriate market share for us in taxable fixed income with Western. And you're exactly right. Given the performance, we should and we do expect to pick up market share in taxables with retail as we go forward. Actually, among our -- you'll notice, if you look back on our Slide 6, Western Asset Core Plus in terms of bond funds was our largest -- has been our largest seller in terms of the retail side. So we are looking forward to growing our market share. We have seen inflows month-to-date in retail at Western.

And we always need to sort of true-up across the global organization for a few days after the month ends. But I would tell you that, for October, with what we're seeing right now, we've got a very solid flow month in place. Equities look to be close to breakeven. Fixed income looks to be strongly positive. As Pete mentioned in his remarks, those are largely institutional fixed income wins at both Brandywine and Western but, as I mentioned, Western's positive retail as well. And then our unfunded pipe for the -- as of the end of October looks to be very, very strong. As for Permal, their business continues to be -- they continue to be largely institutional. We did see a slight slowing in the outflow from the European high-net-worth business. I don't want to overstate that, but it was a nice reversal a little bit, a slowing in that trend. We're actually hoping to go after the European retail business with the launch of our liquid alternatives fund, the -- really the blooper [ph] in the cross-border space. It's really a clone of the U.S. strategy we have. So we've seen outflow over the last several years from the European high-net-worth space. We think we can go after some of that money with our new cross-border fund there. We've also -- we also had just very significant performance with Permal on the flow side out of China during the second quarter, where that strategy, which as you remember, is an AUA strategy. It has characteristics, fee characteristics that are attractive, but it's technically classified as AUA. We saw about, I think, $700 million in flows into that strategy. That strategy performed well from an investment performance standpoint. And we saw really nice flows. That fund now is up over $2 billion. But all that said, Permal has continued to evolve increasingly to the institutional side of the business, but we are -- they are working to continue building out the retail space. We've seen a small pickup in U.S. retail in Permal's strategies, so that's been encouraging, small pickup there. We're hopeful of a similar pickup in Europe and then strong in the retail side with our distribution partner in China. So I think that wraps it."

This highly customized multi-asset-class opportunity is really in the sweet spot of larger kind of insurance sub-advisory demand right now. They do have, I think, about -- in this month of $300 million or so in won and funded wins, so even though they don't show up as unfunded, they actually funded in this month. But -- and that -- I think that was in the small-cap space, which was a nice win for us because that's actually part -- goes back to part of the legacy Batterymarch strategy, which is performing very, very well. You'll also want to remember that we have been very successful in getting QS on a number of platforms. Those don't necessarily come with takeover AUM, but they give you an opportunity for just consistent, steady flow. And I think we've got them on upwards of 10 different platforms over the last year. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, QS is going to be the manager for our smart beta strategies, which we hope to launch at the end of this year or early next year. So the interest and activity level at QS is extraordinarily high. And in addition, just in terms of sort of product development, QS is working actually very closely with a number of our other affiliates in looking at sort of multi-asset-class active strategies, where they can capitalize on Brandywine or Western Asset or ClearBridge and putting those together. So the strong interest in what QS does; strong activity, strong results, I would say, and just a really good feeling about what they're doing."

I'll let Pete maybe try to take a wag on the fee rate a little bit, but the way I think about it is that you're right. I mean we've seen some choppiness in performance in the last few months and couple of quarters. But if you look really at the 3-year or 5-year, which is where most clients really look, overall the performance across the platform remains very, very strong. We know that Royce has been challenged, but aside from Royce, our equity and fixed income performance is just really strong. We saw meaningful improvement, I would say, overall in our equity strategies towards the end of the last quarter. We saw improvement at Royce actually. We saw improvement at ClearBridge, with appreciation on large-cap value. Brandywine, their diversified large-cap value strategy, we saw a nice improvement in performance there. Martin Currie had a significant improvement in 1-year performance, predominately out of their European and China strategies. And then QS, their strategies, particularly the legacy developed market strategies, are just performing at a very, very high level. I think, again if you look at the 3, 5s and 10s for Western, they're north of 80% of strategies beating their benchmarks. So we feel good about the longer-term 3-, 5-, 10-year. We've had some choppiness and up-and-down in the short term, but clients tend to look through that a little bit, which is why you're continuing to see fundings. Now in terms of sort of the unfunded wins at Brandywine, for example, you're seeing unfunded wins largely in opportunistic fixed income, in corporate debt and then in large-cap equity. At Western, it's really corporate debt, high yield, more broad -- and then broader market strategies. And then -- but on the equity side, some of the unfunded wins, both ClearBridge and Martin Currie have ended the quarter with unfunded wins around the $500 million area. In the case of Martin Currie, that was really around regional equity and emerging market equity. And ClearBridge, their unfundeds really were around Aggressive Growth and equity income. Pete, do you want to maybe talk to Mike a little bit about how you see the fee rate from all of that soup that I just put together?"

And it obviously severely impacted not just us but everybody else's portfolios. And equity assets tend to be returning a bit more than fixed, clearly, but a lot more than liquidity. But it -- we've recovered probably half of that due to the market rebound in October. And then when you look at the underlying trends, particularly in our fixed income business, there's really a trade going on between lower fee outflows and higher fee inflows from specialized products that's really becoming much more pronounced. The other thing that's going on -- you asked a bit about retail and institutional [indiscernible] our global distribution businesses actually had 8 straight quarters of inflows, and again, that tends to be of higher fees.

And I -- as I said in the prepared remarks, that's up really from 20%, I think, 14 months ago. So you've seen a significant turnaround there. Now obviously, consultants have a significant and huge influence over institutional flows, and we're seeing that play right into the level of activity, the RFP activity at Western, which is running reasonably ahead of last year, which is good. And then I mentioned on one of my comments that Western believes, and we do as well, that this sort of money-in-motion opportunity continues to be real. It's going to take time. And I can't -- we're not really pulling it out anymore, but we are seeing RFP activity. And in some cases, simply we've actually seen some modest takeovers, without even RFPs, that are really directly tied to sort of money in motion. So with all that's going on, and if you look at investment performance, Western vis-à-vis certain other managers, I would say that, that investment performance, in conjunction with an overconcentration, leaves this money-in-motion concept still in place.

The infrastructure -- the interest in infrastructure is increasing. RARE has a unique value proposition in that it is listed infrastructure. So many large institutional clients like to kind of set it or place it side-by-side with their unlisted infrastructure exposure, so it's -- we see their opportunity to grow institutionally pretty significant in the years ahead. The retail space, as I mentioned, they've long had a dominant position both in Australia and Canada. And we do see an opportunity, a significant opportunity, frankly, in the U.S. and Europe and Asia. One of the good things is that we currently -- even though we just closed last week, because they have a cross-border fund in place, we can actually get out and start marketing that now. And we've actually had a fairly significant amount of inquiry, incoming calls from clients about RARE because of the unique nature of it: the high-yielding nature of it; the long dated; in many cases, inflation sort of protected, even though nobody thinks about inflation today, there are those that are kind of anticipating someday inflation; and the inflation-adjusting nature of a lot of the products in which they invest.

I would tell you that we've actually been in a bear market for credit over the last 15 months or so. And if you go back and look at where credit sped -- credit spreads actually were at their narrow, it would have been in the spring of 2014. And since that time, we've seen credit spreads widen fairly dramatically. And we saw that again during this past quarter. We saw spreads widen. If you actually and if you look out on the long end, they've blown out dramatically. And so I think it's Western's view, and I think it's a very powerful argument, that when you look at where credit spreads are vis-à-vis where anticipated or implied default rates are, spreads are actually very attractive and very cheap in here. And so we would argue that there's less likelihood of spreads widening significantly from here. And if anything, I would argue -- or I don't want to speak for Western because I'm not the CIO, but I would argue that, if the economy strengthens at all, there is room given how -- given the fact we've been in a bear market for credit over the last 15 months or so, I would argue that there's actually an opportunity for credit spreads to tighten. I think the -- but the other part of your question, I think, is very, very important. I think, in the past, Western being a heavily credit-oriented manager, during periods like we experienced during this past quarter, where spreads got very choppy and widened out, I think the general consensus, the historical perspective on Western would have been, ""Gosh, they're just going to grossly underperform."" And the reality is, in this past quarter, the benchmark actually outperformed most active managers in fixed. And -- but Western, in their -- Western's investment performance versus peers was very, very good. And so I think what they've done over the last few years, and we've talked about it -- but you can talk about it all you want. The proof is in the pudding. If you look at significant events where credit spreads have widened and where historically you would have expected Western to underperform, in fact, they've actually performed quite well, either sort of in line with the rest of the market; or with respect to this past quarter, even though down versus the bench versus peers, a very, very good performance. And I think that's part of what you're seeing with the consultants coming around and with the institutions coming around. They are now believing that Western has addressed sort of that high-volatility component or a good part of that high-volatility component to -- with respect to how they manage money."

One, why the -- if I had your comments correct, why the sudden drop in interest in income-oriented products?

I wouldn't read too much into the fact that at ClearBridge the outflows were largely related to income strategies. I think there's a couple of things going on there. I think one was a significant reallocation on the part of one sub-advisory client. And that's a tactical decision, a rebalancing or reallocation that, that client made for whatever reason they made it. We continue to manage a fairly significant amount for them. So I wouldn't read too much into it. That's -- we get rebalancings, we have talked about this, in fixed income. We get rebalancings at times in fixed income, and that comes out of equity. And it goes back and forth, so I wouldn't read too much out of that. We saw certain retail products that weren't performing as well. On the income side, we saw a significant slowdown in flows and a slight uptick in outflows there, but I wouldn't read too much into it. And I would suggest to you that actually that's -- we've seen that reverse a little bit in October, where we're seeing interest again in those income strategies, certainly in the retail space, at ClearBridge. As it relates to the compare and contrast from ClearBridge and Brandywine, the way I think about it is this: ClearBridge has been -- has had some significant kind of headline products or franchise-type products where flows slowed a little bit and actually sales slowed a little bit. Redemptions in those products really didn't significantly increase. It's just the sales did. And I attribute that largely to the market environment. I mean, it was just a pretty darn tough market environment for advisers to be getting retail investors into the market. So we saw -- and there was a little bit of performance there, I would say, but we saw a significant slowdown in some of those franchise products at ClearBridge. And with -- even without a significant uptick in outflows, that just takes your net flows out. I would say Brandywine is a different story. We've never really marketed Brandywine in the field on the equity side. We've obviously done a lot of that on the fixed income side, but it's not really ever been on the retail equity side. A lot of the flows you're seeing -- Brandywine actually has a number of equity products with really terrific performance. And our quasi-institutional and insurance sub-advisory teams have recognized that and have been successful in going after and -- some takeover opportunities at some of their larger clients. So that's what you're seeing there. You're seeing it really in not so much kind of the daily flows out of retail at Brandywine but some large quasi-institutional-type takeover wins there, with a large quasi-institutional outflow at -- tactically done at ClearBridge."

The -- there's always a lot of need for transparency, I guess, in terms of our P&L with the revenue share model. But in terms of discretionary spending, keep in mind that about 2/3 of the spending is at affiliates, where whatever they don't spend on space or travel or whatever goes into their bonus pool, but in quarters like we had last quarter, where revenues were down significantly, it's kind of interesting how self-correcting our model is. Because when you work through the one-off items -- and we've got a roll-forward on Page 17 in the deck, but if you work through those one-off items, we pretty much were flat, core earnings quarter-over-quarter, at about $0.68. So the discretionary spending that we're controlling at corporate, and then kind of the self-correcting nature of the revenue share model really kind of showing through here. And then on other expense, historically, we've probably run more closer to $50 million per quarter, again probably 2/3 of that at the affiliates and 1/3 at the parent level. I'd envision that kind of run rate, that's going to stay down a bit for the foreseeable future until markets bring us back up from a revenue perspective. And then the things that we had at corporate, again, are really the deal costs and the ETF costs that will hit this next quarter. Does that help?"

And actually, we've been going through a fair amount of training internally around this because it's a different sale and it's a different approach. And we really -- our approach within our distribution platform is really around solution selling. And I know that, that is a bit of a buzzword, but that's really the way we approach it. So we're now adding a capability around this ETF strategy and smart beta, which can really stand up next to, and in some cases, we would argue, take share from the passive space, the classic sort of market-cap-weighted passive space. So that's a new capability. And then you bring in something like RARE, and that's another capability that we can bring in. So -- and to provide and address solutions around the needs of our clients. Look, I'm very pleased with the work we've done within -- particularly in the U.S., around adding people; training those people in our model and in our products, which takes time; and then getting them out in front of clients. We've really kind of expanded the number of delivery approaches that we have. We added -- it's not just anymore people in the field and then internal wholesalers, but we've added, over the last few years, a cross-channel desk and then a call center desk. So we've added different ways to kind of go out. We've segmented the adviser population, which is enormous. And then we've, in the process of segmenting it, chosen how we want to address it, whether it's in the field directly face-to-face, whether it's more of a combination of face-to-face and phone sales through our cross-channel team, whether it's really just phone touches that get us into locations where we just have very little chance of getting from a travel standpoint. I feel good about it. I'm not going to give metrics around it because those are sort of internal metrics, but I feel very good about the work that's being done and the fact that we've gotten so many of these people on the lines, talking to clients, the contacts. The one thing I will tell you is the amount of contact that we are having with advisers has grown dramatically over the past year. And that's directly related to the investments that we've made, the people that we've hired. And that contact, when done on a regular basis and relationships established, in tandem with the products that we have, high-quality products with great performance, those -- that's going to yield results. I think there's no one here that has any doubt about that."

We've talked to them about unlisted as you talk about private or unlisted infrastructure. We've talked about infrastructure debt. But right now, there -- and these are guys that could do that, right? Because as I mentioned when we announced the acquisition, Nick Langley and Richard Elmslie are guys that formed this company having grown up in the unlisted infrastructure space. So they understand that, and they've used that knowledge and that capability and that experience to leverage that into the listed infrastructure business. They've got a lot more runway right now in listed infrastructure. So are there opportunities for extensions into infrastructure debt or unlisted infrastructure? Sure, but I think those are down the road. I think there's a lot more runway right now with what they have. I think on the retail side in terms of product, I think the products that they have were -- as I mentioned, we already have a cross-border fund open that our teams in Europe can begin to sell. We're in -- we're optimistic that we're going to be able to get a 40 Act fund with their kind of signature products into the U.S. in reasonably short order, but we don't always control all of that. So I think we're feeling very good about our ability to leverage them. And then I think there's just been a lot of interest from this quasi-institutional penetration that we have. Our quasi-institutional team has just obviously demonstrated how strong it is and how effective it is, particularly with QS; to a certain extent, with Martin Currie; and with our legacy affiliates. I mean we do a ton of business with our legacy affiliates Brandywine, we've highlighted that; and Western. So we really think that's going to be a place where we ought to be able to get some pretty good traction pretty quickly, hopefully, with RARE in that quasi-institutional space. So we feel pretty good about all of the channels and all the opportunities.
Okay, well, I want to thank everybody and those listening who joined us this morning. I hope you could tell that I'm very, very proud of the incredible work on the part of my colleagues here at Legg Mason and our affiliates. And it's all in service to our clients and to our broader stakeholders.
We are pleased with our overall performance in what has certainly been a challenging environment, and yet we see so much more that we can do and we can achieve. Our ambitions at Legg Mason are high, but they're exceeded only by the opportunity before us and our determination to succeed. And I look forward to updating you on our progress again next quarter.
So have a nice day."
