I'd like to start by also welcoming Lawrence to this morning's call.

Malcolm continues is to have geographic responsibility for our businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific. 
In 2014, McCormick delivered solid financial performance despite a difficult environment. Our on-trend categories are growing in markets around the world, with increasing consumer demand for Flavour. We're driving growth in sales and profits, and in 2015, are stepping up our cost reduction activities to fuel our growth.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made progress on a number of fronts, with the successful launch of new products, additional investment in brand marketing to drive growth and building customer intimacy. For the fiscal year, our cash flow exceeded $500 million and we returned a record amount of cash to shareholders. Employees throughout McCormick delivered $65 million in cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and we have embarked on a more aggressive cost savings plan for 2015.
Fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded the guidance we provided back in October with a lower tax rate and an excellent result from our joint venture in Mexico. For our consolidated businesses, sales and operating income were below our projections for this quarter as we continue to face the competitive environment in several markets, and in China, where we were impacted by weak sales to major quick service restaurants customers. Gordon will go into more details in the fourth quarter financial results. 
I want to comment more specifically on our U.S. consumer business. Our main challenge in this market has been fragmentation in the spice and seasonings category, with U.S. retailers bringing smaller brands on the store shelves. These items included value-priced products, ethnic brands and premium as well as organic items. As we head into 2015, this pressure continues. However, we are in a much better position than we were a year ago, with accelerated innovation, brand equity building and our actions to win at retail. 
Among our top-performing U.S. launches in 2014 were Grill Mates burger seasonings, gluten-free recipe mixes and McCormick skillet sauces. We increased our U.S. brand marketing by 7% to support these launches as well as fund an expanded holiday campaign and reinforce our tasty trust message with ads that feature our product quality. Organizationally, we have new leadership in place and more category management resources close to our customers. In working with our retail customers in category management, our objective is to improve their sales and profit as well as sales and profit from McCormick, a win-win solution. 
While we've made good progress, there's still work to be done. Taking a look at 2014, IRI retail consumption data for recipe mixes, the category rose 1%. Sales of our brands grew 3% and we gained 2 percentage points of category share. We're pleased with the strong response to our product innovation and marketing programs. The same data showed a 3% increase in spice and seasoning category sales and 1% sales growth for McCormick products. These are good results and ahead of many other food categories. However, we saw some share gains by smaller brands, none where the category share greater than 3%, and both McCormick brands and private label brands lost share.
As we head into 2015, we're pleased with the category growth rates and we're working to extend our success with recipe mixes to the spice and seasoning category. We said at the outset of 2014 that we expected improvement in our U.S. consumer business to take some time. I believe we have the right team in place and the right actions underway to drive the growing demand for flavor in this important market.
Next, I'd like to provide a broader perspective in our 2014 performance, our growth initiatives and our 2015 outlook. Across all of our businesses, we grew sales in local currency fiscal year by 3%, within our 3% to 5% target range. The strongest contribution toward this growth was in our China consumer business, driven both by the strong growth from WAPC and an 18% increase in the base business. For 2015, we're setting a goal to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency. With about a 2% sales increase from pricing expected, this range is in line with our long-term goals, even without the impact of an acquisition. However, based on the prevailing exchange rates, currency is expected to lower the sales growth range by 3 percentage points.
As you look across the food industry, a 4% to 6% sales growth may seem ambitious, but it's based on several factors that are in our favor. First is the rising demand for flavor. On Slide 6, spice and seasoning category growth was strong in 2014 and is projected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate globally in 2015, with roughly 4% growth in developed markets and nearly a 10% increase in emerging markets. For recipe mixes, the projected global growth is also at a mid-single-digit rate.
Flavors well aligned with the broader changes and the way that people are eating today, whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients are the move towards healthier eating. We think that these changes are here to stay and that each of them drives demand for flavor. This is a catalyst, not only to our consumer business, but also to our industrial business. As an example, more than 1/3 of our 2014 industrial new product brief had some type of health and wellness attribute. 
Second, we're continuing to increase our investment in brand marketing. Our current level of marketing is up more than 50% [ph] from 5 years ago, and our latest campaigns were emphasizing new products, quality and freshness, everyday cooking and holiday celebrations. We're planning a further increase in 2015. Digital marketing has a particularly high ROI and we're making it a greater part of the mix. This year, it's planned at 1/3 of our total advertising, up from 11% in 2010.
As we develop our marketing programs, a leading audience is Millenials. In the U.S., a recent study shows that household penetration of our brands with Millenials is right in line with other ease groups. We also conducted an attitude study. This work revealed that 46% of U.S. Millenials regard the McCormick brand as the best spice brand in the market, and another 37% categorized it as one of the best. Again, these metrics are similar to what we see with other age groups.
Third, our 2015 sales growth projection includes a strong impact from innovation. With 16 innovation centers in 12 countries around the world, we continue to invest in product development. Earlier this month, we open a new product development facility for our U.S. consumer business. In 2014, we had particular success with our squeeze pouch packets, that led to a 25% increase in check ketchup sales in China, and in North America, with gluten-free recipe mixes and skillet sauces. In France, our Vahiné Premium Vanilla has driven category growth. 
In the first half of 2015, we have a great lineup of innovation and are particularly excited about the relaunch of our entire U.S. gourmet line, featuring greater variety of flavor-seal technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma, and packaging that has a more premium, fresh appearance. We're introducing favorite sea salt grinders across North America, an Indian range of seasoning blends in the U.K. and further extension of our Vahiné dessert items in France. 
For our industrial business, much of our growth in 2014 came from innovative seasonings for snacks, chips, crackers and snack bars as well as beverage flavors, and we have more innovation pipeline and 2015. With our foundation in spices and herbs, industrial customers continue to be McCormick as the go-to supplier to help grow their range of healthy and flavorful products. Across both businesses, 8% of 2014 sales came from new products that were launched in the last 3 years. 
The fourth factor to drive 2015 sales growth is customer intimacy. For retail customers, our share of voice, social media presence, digital marketing initiatives, product innovation and category analytics distinguish McCormick from the competition in just about every market where we participate. As discussed during 2014, we're using our category analytics to optimize sales and profitability for us and our customers, achieving a win-win solution.
For industrial customers, a vital part of customer intimacy is support for global growth. In this regard, we opened a small R&D center in Brazil during 2014. And by 2016, we expect to establish a footprint in the Middle East to support our customers' expansion into this region.
Clearly, our business at McCormick is well aligned with healthy category growth, and we have strong initiatives underway to drive sales. Along with these factors, an integral part of our long-term success has been our cost-savings activity. As depicted on Slide 10, for the past decade, a combination of our CCI program and streamlining actions have generated significant cost savings. We've used these savings to fuel our growth for brand marketing and product development, offset material cost inflation and drive profits. In 2013, we began to go at this more aggressively with the announcement of reorganization activities in our EMEA region. This was followed in 2014 by the realignment of certain manufacturing operations in our U.S. industrial business and some additional SG&A streamlining in the fourth quarter. In 2015, we've set a goal to generate at least $85 million in cost savings, led by our CCI program. We expect additional cost savings this year as we wrap up previously announced streamlining actions. We're also taken the next step in our North American effectiveness initiative that began in 2014. Following the formation of our North American organization and leadership team, we're undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements in this part of our business. Through these actions, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $25 million by 2016.
As demonstrated in previous years, we have the ability to offset the impact of material cost increases, minimizing the profit impact from both consumer and industrial businesses. For 2015, pricing actions and anticipated cost savings will be a major offset to the higher material costs.
Let's move from sales and growth and fuel for growth to our profit performance and outlook. We met our fiscal year 2014 sales objectives and exceeded the cost savings target. However, adjusted operating income growth at 3% was below our initial range of 6% to 8%. A major reason was the more rapid growth in international markets, but slower growth in our more profitable U.S. businesses. As a result, we had a lower contribution to operating income, although there were some offset at the net income line to a more favorable tax rate. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share rose 8% to 3 37. This was above our initial target, largely due to the favorable tax rate and strong growth from our unconsolidated McCormick to Mexico joint venture. As you know, our long-term goal was to grow earnings per share 9% to 11%. On a comparable basis, we've achieved the 5-year compounded annual growth rate of 8%, just below our long-term goal. 
While we've had solid sales growth, we've managed through a number of headwinds during this period, including higher than normal material cost inflation and retirement benefit expense. In recent years, we've taken actions to reduce retirement benefit cost, including a lump sum payout and closing our pension plans. In 2015, we expect both the retirement expense and material inflation to once again cause profit pressure, along with the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. 
We're responding to these cost pressures with more aggressive cost savings actions while continuing to invest in marketing programs and innovation. We're committed to building our brand equity and competing effectively in each of our markets. Consumer demand for flavors is increasing and we want to help drive this growth. 
Let me summarize. I'd like to recognize employees throughout McCormick and our leadership team for their engagement and accomplishments. As we navigate through this period of competitive activity and cost inflation, we are pursuing attractive category growth opportunities and a very robust environment for flavor around the world. One of our strategic growth -- strategic imperatives is growth. To win share with global focus. And that's driving focus for me as well as the entire organization in 2015. 
At this point, I'm going to turn it over to Gordon for a closer look at the fourth quarter and our every 2015 guidance. Gordon?"

As Alan indicated, our fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded our projections with a favorable tax rate and higher joint venture income. These favorable variances more than offset a greater than expected decline in adjusted operating income, mainly in our consumer business. 
I'd like to comment on our sales and operating results for each segment. As seen on Slide 15, we grew consumer business sales 3% in local currency. The impact of pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix contributed to this increase. Sales in the Americas rose 4% in local currency, with the benefit of a 2% increase in volume and product mix as well as higher pricing. 
In the third quarter, we discussed the timing of retailer purchases under our holiday display program. In 2014 versus the year-ago period, we had your purchases in the third quarter and more of these purchases in the fourth quarter. A you look at Americas consumer business sales for the second half eliminates the impact of this year-on-year shift in sales between the third and fourth quarters.
For the second half of 2014, we grew sales in local currency 2%, with pricing up 1.5% and volume and product mix up about 0.5%. This was a significant improvement from the first half when sales in local currency declined 4% due to lower volume and product mix.
In EMEA, consumer business sales in local currency were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013. We had sales pressure from competitive conditions in several markets along with a favorable impact from higher pricing, product innovation and expanded distribution.
In local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region were comparable to the year-ago period. In this region, we grew sales 5% in China, offsetting weakness in Australia and India. 
In total, for the consumer business, adjusted operating income declined 4% from the fourth quarter of 2013, excluding special charges and last year's loss on voluntary pension settlement. While we grew sales and achieved CCI cost savings, we funded a $5 million increase in brand marketing support, and business mix was unfavorable.
Turning next to our industrial business. Fourth quarter sales were down slightly from the year-ago period in local currency, with lower volume and product mix partially offset by higher pricing as seen on Slide 20. In the Americas region, we grew industrial business sales 1% in local currency. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings have been a source of strong growth. This increase, along with higher sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 2% in local currency, driven by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs. We grew sales of branded food service products, led to the decline in volume and product mix this period.
Industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the news of weak sales from the large quick-service restaurants in China, we were appropriately cautious in our fourth quarter outlook. Even with this weakness in the latter part of 2014, we grew Asia/Pacific industrial sales 2% in local currency for the fiscal year. 
We were extremely pleased with the profit results for industrial business in fiscal year 2014, with adjusted operating income up 13% from a difficult 2013, and up 10% on a 2-year comparison to 2012. We achieved higher sales and increase margins from CCI cost savings and a more favorable business mix. 
As we anticipated in our previous earnings call, fourth quarter adjusted operating income declined mainly due to the lower volume in China as well as a year-on-year increase and incentive compensation. 
Across both segments, adjusted operating income for the total business declined 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross profit margin was up 20 basis points due in large part to our cost savings efforts. During the quarter, we funded $5 million of additional brand marketing programs. We recorded $3 million in special charges this quarter related to streamlining activity in EMEA and other regions.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 26%. This was above the 24% tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013, but below our guidance due to discrete tax items. Based on our current outlook, we expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% in 2015. This range is an increase from the 26.3% tax rate for fiscal year 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose to $9 million this quarter from $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This performance was led by our joint venture in Mexico, which grew sales 8% and is operating in a new more efficient manufacturing facility. We expect this 2014 performance to lead to higher cash dividends paid by this joint venture to McCormick, and expect further profit growth as well in 2015.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.16. As you could see on Slide 28, this was a year-on-year decrease of $0.04 comprised of lower adjusted operating income and a higher tax rate, offset in part by the favorable effects of higher joint venture income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 29, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $500 million for the first time, and increased $38 million from fiscal year 2013. This improvement included higher adjusted net income and the lower pension contribution in 2014. 
During 2014, we used $244 million of cash to repurchase 3.6 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $116 million still available on our $400 million authorization.
Our capital expenditures were approximately 3% of sales. Some of the larger 2014 projects included a plant expansion in Poland and plant modernization for Zatarain's production in Louisiana. For the year-end, we purchased a new office facility in Shanghai to accommodate our growth in China.
In 2015, we expect capital expenditures of $130 million to $140 million. This projection includes a new facility to accommodate the growth of our Shanghai manufacturing operations as well as construction of a production facility in the Middle East to support expansion of our industrial customers.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are close to our target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including acquisitions. 
I'll will wrap up our remarks with McCormick's 2015 financial outlook. As Alan described, we expect solid growth in sales and profit from our consolidated operations, higher income from unconsolidated operations and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency to include higher pricing, and a 2% to 4% volume increase. Based on prevailing rates, foreign currency exchange is expected to lower the sales range by 3 percentage points.
We anticipate a 4% to 5% increase in adjusted operating income from $608 million in 2014 with a projected increase driven by higher sales and at least $85 million of cost savings for both CCI and streamlining actions.
Offsets include projected mid-single-digit material cost inflation, unfavorable currency exchange rates, increased retirement benefit expense and an increase of at least 5% of brand marketing. Those of you who have followed us in recent years are aware of fluctuations in retirement benefit expense, driven by the actual substance for the discount rate. In 2015, we expect a $10 million increase in this expense due to a lower discount rate, along with new U.S. mortality assumptions that reflect a longer life expectancy.
Keep in mind that although we expect an increase in retirement benefit expense, the cash contributions to our plans are expected to be approximately $16 million, which is close to 2014's low level of contributions. 
Our projected range for adjusted earnings per share is $3.51 to $3.58. This is an increase of 4% to 6% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.37 in 2014. Along with higher operating income, we anticipate continued growth in joint venture income and for the reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. 
At the EPS line, higher retirement benefit expense and unfavorable currency are expected to lower our year-on-year EPS growth rate by about 3%. And excluding these factors, our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance is a 7% to 9% increase. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect earnings per share to be up slightly from the year-ago period. While our tax rate should be lower than the 31% we recorded in the first quarter of 2014, we expect operating income to be under pressure from currency rates, higher brand marketing, increased retirement expense and the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for the higher dividend approved by The board in November as well as our capital expenditures and share repurchase activity.
Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

There seems to be bit of a confusion about the pricing strategy there and what we're seeing in the Nielsen data versus the price increase that, I think, you mentioned that time around. We're seeing fairly sharp reductions in price per pound to the tune of about a mid-single-digit rate. That -- some of that might be negative mix, which I think you mentioned. But we're also just kind of curious about what is actually happening there. Not just in the quarter, but as we look out for 2015, as you take that next price increase, are you worried about further share losses to some of those smaller brands? And are you confident that the innovation that you've got in line -- in place, is going to allow you to drive that mid-single-digit top line growth overall?"

First, to reiterate, we've made no changes in list prices in our U.S. business. We Increased prices at the end of 2013 and in 2014. We've made no changes in list prices. So a couple of things were happening. One is what we've seen is that more of our promotional spend in 2014 ended up in the second half of the year. The second is there is a sizable controlled label, which is an extreme value product, which we've had in the market with 1 customer for a long period of time that was pretty heavily promoted in the second half of the year and it shows up as a McCormick brand, and it is a brand that we own in the data. And so that is driving some of it, and in another case, we actually took the number of units in our Recipe Inspirations from 6 spices in the line to 3, and reduced the price of that offering. So there's a good bit going on there. We don't plan any price increases at this point in our U.S. consumer business. We're dealing with some commodity inflation, with our cost reduction activities. And as you saw, being more aggressive on that. But we expect to see more stable pricing in our U.S. business. Now we are taking pricing in our industrial businesses to help offset some of the commodity increases and in some of the other markets. But in our U.S. business our plan is to hold pricing more stable."

U.K. is a little bit of a tougher competitive market. And in China, even without the acquisition, that acquisition far exceeded our expectations, but our consumer business in China continues to grow at double-digit, so we feel pretty good about that. The key effort and the thing that we have to do in order to make this plan is really to get core growth in our U.S. business in spices and seasonings.

Our acquisition record over the last couple of years has not been as consistent, so we've had -- the acquisitions we've made have been good, but we haven't done 1 every year as our long-term guidance would suggest. The second thing is we've had so much volatility over the last 5 years in cost. As I said earlier, pepper's up 500% basically in the last 5 years, and so we've had to deal with a lot of that volatility. And then the other pieces are the ups and downs of things like pension expense and those sorts of things. What we're really focused on is making sure that we're running the businesses the right way, that we are driving the category and driving growth to be able to perform that way. So we do discuss the long-term goals. We lay out plans that we believe we'll hit it. And then we adjust year-on-year based on what's actually happening in our, both our cost structure and our -- with our customers.

In 2014, McCormick delivered solid financial performance despite a difficult environment. Our on-trend categories are growing in markets around the world, with increasing consumer demand for flavor. We're driving growth in sales and profit and in 2015, are stepping up our cost reduction activities to fuel our growth.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made progress on a number of fronts, with the successful launch of new products, additional investment in brand marketing to drive growth and building customer intimacy. For the fiscal year, our cash flow exceeded $500 million, and we returned a record amount of cash to shareholders. Employees throughout McCormick delivered $65 million in cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and we have embarked on a more aggressive cost savings plan for 2015.
Fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded the guidance we provided back in October with a lower tax rate and an excellent result from our joint venture in Mexico. For our consolidated businesses, sales and operating income were below our projections for this quarter as we continued to face a competitive environment in several markets, and in China, where we were impacted by weak sales to major quick-service restaurant customers. Gordon will go into more details in the fourth quarter financial results. 
I want to comment more specifically on our U.S. consumer business. Our main challenge in this market has been fragmentation in the spice and seasoning category, with U.S. retailers bringing smaller brands on the store shelves. These items included value-priced products, ethnic brands and premium as well as organic items. As we head into 2015, this pressure continues. However, we're in a much better position than we were a year ago, with accelerated innovation, brand equity building and our actions to win at retail. 
Among our top-performing U.S. launches in 2014 were Grill Mates burger seasonings, gluten-free recipe mixes and McCormick Skillet Sauces. We increased our U.S. brand marketing by 7% to support these launches as well as fund an expanded holiday campaign and reinforce our Taste You Trust message with ads that feature our product quality. Organizationally, we have new leadership in place and more category management resources close to our customers. In working with our retail customers in category management, our objective is to improve their sales and profit as well as sales and profit for McCormick, a win-win solution. 
While we've made good progress, there's still work to be done. Taking a look at 2014 IRI retail consumption data for recipe mixes, the category rose 1%. Sales of our brands grew 3%, and we gained 2 percentage points of category share. We're pleased with the strong response to our product innovation and marketing programs. The same data showed a 3% increase in spice and seasoning category sales and 1% sales growth for McCormick products. These are good results and ahead of many other food categories. However, we saw some share gains by smaller brands, none with a category share greater than 3%, and both McCormick brands and private label brands lost share. As we head into 2015, we're pleased with the category growth rates, and we're working to extend our success with recipe mixes to the spice and seasoning category. We said at the outset of 2014 that we expected improvement in our U.S. consumer business to take some time. I believe we have the right team in place and the right actions underway to drive the growing demand for flavor in this important market.
Next, I'd like to provide a broader perspective on our 2014 performance, our growth initiatives and our 2015 outlook. Across all of our businesses, we grew sales in local currency for fiscal year by 3%, within our 3% to 5% target range. The strongest contribution toward this growth was in our China consumer business, driven both by the strong growth from WAPC and an 18% increase in the base business. For 2015, we're setting a goal to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency. With about a 2% sales increase from pricing expected, this range is in line with our long-term goals, even without the impact of an acquisition. However, based on the prevailing exchange rates, currency is expected to lower the sales growth range by 3 percentage points.
As you look across the food industry, a 4% to 6% sales growth may seem ambitious, but it's based on several factors that are in our favor. First is the rising demand for flavor. On Slide 6, spice and seasoning category growth was strong in 2014 and is projected to grow at a mid single-digit rate globally in 2015, with roughly 4% growth in developed markets and nearly a 10% increase in emerging markets. For recipe mixes, the projected global growth is also at a mid single-digit rate.
Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes and the way that people are eating today, whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients or the move towards healthier eating. We think that these changes are here to stay and that each of them drives demand for flavor. This is a catalyst, not only to our consumer business, but also to our industrial business. As an example, more than 1/3 of our 2014 industrial new product briefs had some type of health and wellness attribute. 
Second, we're continuing to increase our investment in brand marketing. Our current level of marketing is up more than 50% from 5 years ago, and our latest campaigns were emphasizing new products, quality and freshness, everyday cooking and holiday celebrations. We're planning a further increase in 2015. Digital marketing has a particularly high ROI, and we're making it a greater part of the mix. This year, it's planned at 1/3 of our total advertising, up from 11% in 2010.
As we develop our marketing programs, a leading audience is Millennials. In the U.S., a recent study shows that household penetration of our brands with Millennials is right in line with other age groups. We also conducted an attitude study. This work revealed that 46% of U.S. Millennials regard the McCormick brand as the best spice brand in the market, and another 37% categorized it as one of the best. Again, these metrics are similar to what we see with other age groups.
Third, our 2015 sales growth projection includes a strong impact from innovation. With 16 innovation centers in 12 countries around the world, we continue to invest in product development. Earlier this month, we opened a new product development facility for our U.S. consumer business. In 2014, we had particular success with our squeeze pouch package that led to a 25% increase in ketchup sales in China and in North America, with gluten-free recipe mixes and skillet sauces. In France, our Vahiné premium vanilla has driven category growth. 
In the first half of 2015, we have a great lineup of innovation and are particularly excited about the relaunch of our entire U.S. gourmet line, featuring greater variety of flavor-seal technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has a more premium, fresh appearance. We're introducing flavored sea salt grinders across North America, an Indian range of seasoning blends in the U.K. and further extension of our Vahiné dessert items in France. 
For our industrial business, much of our growth in 2014 came from innovative seasonings for snack chips, crackers and snack bars as well as beverage flavors, and we have more in the innovation pipeline in 2015. With our foundation in spices and herbs, industrial customers continue to view McCormick as the go-to supplier to help grow their range of healthy and flavorful products. Across both businesses, 8% of 2014 sales came from new products that were launched in the last 3 years. 
The fourth factor to drive 2015 sales growth is customer intimacy. For retail customers, our share of voice, social media presence, digital marketing initiatives, product innovation and category analytics distinguish McCormick from the competition in just about every market where we participate. As discussed during 2014, we're using our category analytics to optimize sales and profitability for us and our customers, achieving a win-win solution. For industrial customers, a vital part of customer intimacy is support for our global growth. In this regard, we opened a small R&D center in Brazil during 2014. And by 2016, we expect to establish a footprint in the Middle East to support our customers' expansion into this region.
Clearly, our business at McCormick is well aligned with healthy category growth, and we have strong initiatives underway to drive sales. Along with these factors, an integral part of our long-term success has been our cost savings activity. As depicted on Slide 10, for the past decade, a combination of our CCI program and streamlining actions have generated significant cost savings. We've used these savings to fuel our growth through brand marketing and product development, offset material cost inflation and drive profits. In 2013, we began to go at this more aggressively with the announcement of reorganization activities in our EMEA region. This was followed in 2014 by the realignment of certain manufacturing operations in our U.S. industrial business and some additional SG&A streamlining in the fourth quarter. In 2015, we've set a goal to generate at least $85 million in cost savings, led by our CCI program. We expect additional cost savings this year as we wrap up previously announced streamlining actions. We're also taking the next step in our North American effectiveness initiative that began in 2014. Following the formation of our North American organization and leadership team, we're undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements in this part of our business. Through these actions, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $25 million by 2016.
As demonstrated in previous years, we have the ability to offset the impact of material cost increases, minimizing the profit impact on both consumer and industrial businesses. For 2015, pricing actions and anticipated cost savings will be a major offset to the higher material costs.
Let's move from sales and growth and fuel for growth to our profit performance and outlook. We met our fiscal year 2014 sales objectives and exceeded the cost savings target. However, adjusted operating income growth at 3% was below our initial range of 6% to 8%. A major reason was the more rapid growth in international markets but slower growth in our more profitable U.S. businesses. As a result, we had a lower contribution to operating income, although there were some offset at the net income line through a more favorable tax rate. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share rose 8% to $3.37. This was above our initial target, largely due to the favorable tax rate and strong growth from an unconsolidated McCormick de Mexico joint venture. As you know, our long-term goal was to grow earnings per share 9% to 11%. On a comparable basis, we've achieved the 5-year compounded annual growth rate of 8%, just below our long-term goal. 
While we've had solid sales growth, we've managed through a number of headwinds during this period, including higher-than-normal material cost inflation and retirement benefit expense. In recent years, we've taken actions to reduce retirement benefit costs, including a lump sum payout and closing our pension plans. In 2015, we expect both the retirement expense and material inflation to once again cause profit pressure, along with the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. 
We're responding to these cost pressures with more aggressive cost savings actions while continuing to invest in marketing programs and innovation. We're committed to building our brand equity and competing effectively in each of our markets. Consumer demand for flavor is increasing, and we want to help drive this growth. 
Let me summarize. I'd like to recognize employees throughout McCormick and our leadership team for their engagement and accomplishments. As we navigate through this period of competitive activity and cost inflation, we are pursuing attractive category growth opportunities in a very robust environment for flavor around the world. One of our strategic growth -- strategic imperatives is growth, to win share with global focus. And that's driving focus for me as well as the entire organization in 2015. 
At this point, I'm going to turn it over to Gordon for a closer look at the fourth quarter and our 2015 guidance. Gordon?"

As Alan indicated, our fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded our projection with a favorable tax rate and higher joint venture income. These favorable variances more than offset a greater-than-expected decline in adjusted operating income, mainly in our consumer business. 
I'd like to comment on our sales and operating results for each segment. As seen on Slide 15, we grew consumer business sales 3% in local currency. The impact of pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix contributed to this increase. Sales in the Americas rose 4% in local currency, with the benefit of a 2% increase in volume and product mix as well as higher pricing. 
In the third quarter, we discussed the timing of retailer purchases under our holiday display program. In 2014 versus the year-ago period, we had fewer purchases in the third quarter and more of these purchases in the fourth quarter. A look at Americas consumer business sales for the second half eliminates the impact of this year-on-year shift in sales between the third and fourth quarters. For the second half of 2014, we grew sales in local currency 2%, with pricing up 1.5% and volume and product mix up about 0.5%. This was a significant improvement from the first half when sales in local currency declined 4% due to lower volume and product mix.
In EMEA, consumer business sales in local currency were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013. We had sales pressure from competitive conditions in several markets, along with a favorable impact from higher pricing, product innovation and expanded distribution. In local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to the year-ago period. In this region, we grew sales 5% in China, offsetting weakness in Australia and India. 
In total, for the consumer business, adjusted operating income declined 4% from the fourth quarter of 2013, excluding special charges and last year's loss on voluntary pension settlement. While we grew sales and achieved CCI cost savings, we funded a $5 million increase in brand marketing support, and business mix was unfavorable.
Turning next to our industrial business. Fourth quarter sales were down slightly from the year-ago period in local currency, with lower volume and product mix largely offset by higher pricing, as seen on Slide 20. In the Americas region, we grew industrial business sales 1% in local currency. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings have been a source of strong growth. This increase, along with higher sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 2% in local currency, driven by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs. Weaker sales of branded food service products led to the decline in volume and product mix this period.
Industrial business sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the news of weak sales from the large quick-service restaurants in China, we were appropriately cautious in our fourth quarter outlook. Even with this weakness in the latter part of 2014, we grew Asia Pacific industrial sales 2% in local currency for the fiscal year. 
We were extremely pleased with the profit results for our industrial business in fiscal year 2014, with adjusted operating income up 13% from a difficult 2013 and up 10% on a 2-year comparison to 2012. We achieved higher sales and increased margins from CCI cost savings and a more favorable business mix. 
As we anticipated in our previous earnings call, fourth quarter adjusted operating income declined, mainly due to the lower volume in China as well as a year-on-year increase in incentive compensation. 
Across both segments, adjusted operating income for the total business declined 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross profit margin was up 20 basis points, due in large part to our cost savings efforts. During the quarter, we funded $5 million of additional brand marketing programs. We recorded $3 million in special charges this quarter related to streamlining activity in EMEA and other regions.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 26%. This was above the 24% tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013, but below our guidance due to discrete tax items. Based on our current outlook, we expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% in 2015. This range is an increase from the 26.3% tax rate for fiscal year 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose to $9 million this quarter from $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This performance was led by our joint venture in Mexico, which grew sales 8% and is operating in a new, more efficient manufacturing facility. We expect this 2014 performance to lead to higher cash dividend paid by this joint venture to McCormick and expect further profit growth as well in 2015.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.16. As you can see on Slide 28, this was a year-on-year decrease of $0.04 comprised of lower adjusted operating income and a higher tax rate, offset in part by the favorable effects of higher joint venture income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 29. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $500 million for the first time and increased $38 million from fiscal year 2013. This improvement included higher adjusted net income and a lower pension contribution in 2014. 
During 2014, we used $244 million of cash to repurchase 3.6 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $116 million still available on our $400 million authorization.
Our capital expenditures were approximately 3% of sales. Some of the larger 2014 projects included a plant expansion in Poland and plant modernization for Zatarain's production in Louisiana. For the year-end, we purchased a new office facility in Shanghai to accommodate our growth in China.
In 2015, we expect capital expenditures of $130 million to $140 million. This projection includes the new facility to accommodate the growth of our Shanghai manufacturing operations as well as construction of a production facility in the Middle East to support expansion of our industrial customers.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are close to our target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including acquisitions. 
I'll wrap up our remarks with McCormick's 2015 financial outlook. As Alan described, we expect solid growth in sales and profit from our consolidated operations, higher income from unconsolidated operations and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency to include higher pricing and a 2% to 4% volume increase. Based on prevailing rates, foreign currency exchange is expected to lower the sales range by 3 percentage points.
We anticipate a 4% to 5% increase in adjusted operating income from $608 million in 2014, with the projected increase driven by higher sales and at least $85 million of cost savings from both CCI and streamlining actions.
Offsets include projected mid single-digit material cost inflation, unfavorable currency exchange rates, increased retirement benefit expense and an increase of at least 5% in brand marketing. Those of you who have followed us in recent years are aware of fluctuations in retirement benefit expense, driven by the actuarial assumption for the discount rate. In 2015, we expect a $10 million increase in this expense due to a lower discount rate, along with new U.S. mortality assumptions that reflect a longer life expectancy. Keep in mind that although we expect an increase in retirement benefit expense, the cash contributions to our plans are expected to be approximately $16 million, which is close to 2014's low level of contributions. 
Our projected range for adjusted earnings per share is $3.51 to $3.58. This is an increase of 4% to 6% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.37 in 2014. Along with higher operating income, we anticipate continued growth in joint venture income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. 
At the EPS line, higher retirement benefit expense and unfavorable currency are expected to lower our year-on-year EPS growth rate by about 3%. And excluding these factors, our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance is a 7% to 9% increase. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect earnings per share to be up slightly from the year-ago period. While our tax rate should be lower than the 31% we recorded in the first quarter of 2014, we expect operating income to be under pressure from currency rates, higher brand marketing, increased retirement expense and the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for the higher dividend approved by the board in November as well as our capital expenditures and share repurchase activity.
Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

But we're also just kind of curious about what is actually happening there, not just in the quarter, but as we look out to 2015. As you take that next price increase, are you worried about further share losses to some of those smaller brands?

First, to reiterate, we've made no changes in list prices in our U.S. business. We increased prices at the end of 2013. And in 2014, we've made no changes in list prices. So a couple of things were happening. One is what we've seen is that more of our promotional spend in 2014 ended up in the second half of the year. The second is there is a sizable controlled label, which is an extreme value product, which we've had in the market with one customer for a long period of time that was pretty heavily promoted in the second half of the year. And it shows up as a McCormick brand, and it is a brand that we own in the data. And so that is driving some of it. And then in another case, we actually took the number of units in our Recipe Inspirations from 6 spices in the line to 3 and reduced the price of that offering. So there's a good bit going on there. We don't plan any price increases at this point in our U.S. consumer business. We're dealing with some commodity inflation with our cost reduction activities and as you saw, being more aggressive on that. But we expect to see more stable pricing in our U.S. business. Now we are taking pricing in our industrial businesses to help offset some of the commodity increases and in some of the other markets. But in our U.S. business, our plan is to hold pricing more stable."

I mean, some of the drivers on the line in general is our global scale, which has complexity. And we have joint ventures below the line, which require management and resources. So those are factors we want to remind people that require management and resources and don't end up in a percentage in net sales because it's all below the line. But having said that, we continue to look at how we can become more efficient as well as effective through faster streamlining of our decisions and more consolidation of back offices. In the more recent activities, you're well aware of what we talked about for our European organization last year. That is part of the guidance that we have this year as we continued into a shared service environment there as well as more recently announced, North American actions that align more effectively under the structure that we have now, which, again, results in efficiencies in our decision-making there. So it's a balancing act to make sure that we are being aggressive on that line. But at the same time, we are growing categories, and we want to make sure we're putting proper resources behind the growth that these categories enjoy."

Our acquisition record over the last couple of years has not been as consistent, so we've had -- the acquisitions we've made have been good, but we haven't done one every year, as our long-term guidance would suggest. The second thing is we've had so much volatility over the last 5 years in cost. As I said earlier, pepper's up 500% basically in the last 5 years, and so we've had to deal with a lot of that volatility. And then the other pieces are the ups and downs of things like pension expense and those sorts of things.

In 2014, McCormick delivered solid financial performance despite a difficult environment. Our on-trend categories are growing in markets around the world, with increasing consumer demand for flavor. We're driving growth in sales and profit and in 2015, are stepping up our cost reduction activities to fuel our growth.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made progress on a number of fronts, with the successful launch of new products, additional investment in brand marketing to drive growth and building customer intimacy. For the fiscal year, our cash flow exceeded $500 million, and we returned a record amount of cash to shareholders. Employees throughout McCormick delivered $65 million in cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and we have embarked on a more aggressive cost savings plan for 2015.
Fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded the guidance we provided back in October, with a lower tax rate and an excellent result from our joint venture in Mexico. For our consolidated businesses, sales and operating income were below our projections for this quarter as we continued to face a competitive environment in several markets, and in China, where we were impacted by weak sales to major quick-service restaurant customers. Gordon will go into more details in the fourth quarter financial results. 
I want to comment more specifically on our U.S. consumer business. Our main challenge in this market has been fragmentation in the spice and seasoning category, with U.S. retailers bringing smaller brands onto store shelves. These items included value-priced products, ethnic brands and premium as well as organic items. As we head into 2015, this pressure continues. However, we're in a much better position than we were a year ago, with accelerated innovation, brand equity building and our actions to win at retail. 
Among our top-performing U.S. launches in 2014 were Grill Mates burger seasonings, gluten-free recipe mixes and McCormick Skillet Sauces. We increased our U.S. brand marketing by 7% to support these launches as well as fund an expanded holiday campaign and reinforce our Taste You Trust message with ads that feature our product quality. Organizationally, we have new leadership in place and more category management resources close to our customers. In working with our retail customers in category management, our objective is to improve their sales and profit, as well as sales and profit for McCormick, a win-win solution. 
While we've made good progress, there's still work to be done. Taking a look at 2014 IRI retail consumption data for recipe mixes, the category rose 1%. Sales of our brands grew 3%, and we gained 2 percentage points of category share. We're pleased with the strong response to our product innovation and marketing programs. The same data showed a 3% increase in spice and seasoning category sales and 1% sales growth for McCormick products. These are good results and ahead of many other food categories. However, we saw some share gains by smaller brands, none with a category share greater than 3%, and both McCormick brands and private label brands lost share. As we head into 2015, we're pleased with the category growth rates, and we're working to extend our success with recipe mixes to the spice and seasoning category. We said at the outset of 2014 that we expected improvement in our U.S. consumer business to take some time. I believe we have the right team in place and the right actions underway to drive the growing demand for flavor in this important market.
Next, I'd like to provide a broader perspective on our 2014 performance, our growth initiatives and our 2015 outlook. Across all of our businesses, we grew sales in local currency for fiscal year by 3%, within our 3% to 5% target range. The strongest contribution toward this growth was in our China consumer business, driven both by the strong growth from WAPC and an 18% increase in the base business. For 2015, we're setting a goal to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency. With about a 2% sales increase from pricing expected, this range is in line with our long-term goals, even without the impact of an acquisition. However, based on the prevailing exchange rates, currency is expected to lower the sales growth range by 3 percentage points.
As you look across the food industry, a 4% to 6% sales growth may seem ambitious, but it's based on several factors that are in our favor. First is the rising demand for flavor. On Slide 6, spice and seasoning category growth was strong in 2014 and is projected to grow at a mid single-digit rate globally in 2015, with roughly 4% growth in developed markets and nearly a 10% increase in emerging markets. For recipe mixes, the projected global growth is also at a mid single-digit rate.
Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way that people are eating today, whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients or the move towards healthier eating. We think that these changes are here to stay and that each of them drives demand for flavor. This is a catalyst, not only to our consumer business, but also to our industrial business. As an example, more than 1/3 of our 2014 industrial new product briefs had some type of health and wellness attribute. 
Second, we're continuing to increase our investment in brand marketing. Our current level of marketing is up more than 50% from 5 years ago. In our latest campaigns, we're emphasizing new products, quality and freshness, everyday cooking and holiday celebrations. We're planning a further increase in 2015. Digital marketing has a particularly high ROI, and we're making it a greater part of the mix. This year, it's planned at 1/3 of our total advertising, up from 11% in 2010.
As we develop our marketing programs, a leading audience is millennials. In the U.S., a recent study shows that household penetration of our brands with millennials is right in line with other age groups. We also conducted an attitude study. This work revealed that 46% of U.S. millennials regard the McCormick brand as the best spice brand in the market, and another 37% categorized it as one of the best. Again, these metrics are similar to what we see with other age groups.
Third, our 2015 sales growth projection includes a strong impact from innovation. With 16 innovation centers in 12 countries around the world, we continue to invest in product development. Earlier this month, we opened a new product development facility for our U.S. consumer business. In 2014, we had particular success with our squeeze pouch package that led to a 25% increase in ketchup sales in China and in North America, with gluten-free recipe mixes and Skillet Sauces. In France, our Vahiné premium vanilla has driven category growth. 
In the first half of 2015, we have a great lineup of innovation and are particularly excited about the relaunch of our entire U.S. gourmet line, featuring greater variety, a flavor-seal technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has a more premium, fresh appearance. We're introducing flavored sea salt grinders across North America, an Indian range of seasoning blends in the U.K. and further extension of our Vahiné dessert items in France. 
For our industrial business, much of our growth in 2014 came from innovative seasonings for snack chips, crackers and snack bars as well as beverage flavors, and we have more in the innovation pipeline in 2015. With our foundation in spices and herbs, industrial customers continue to view McCormick as the go-to supplier to help grow their range of healthy and flavorful products. Across both businesses, 8% of 2014 sales came from new products that were launched in the last 3 years. 
The fourth factor to drive 2015 sales growth is customer intimacy. For retail customers, our share of voice, social media presence, digital marketing initiatives, product innovation and category analytics distinguish McCormick from the competition in just about every market where we participate. As discussed during 2014, we're using our category analytics to optimize sales and profitability for us and our customers, achieving a win-win solution. For industrial customers, a vital part of customer intimacy is support for our global growth. In this regard, we opened a small R&D center in Brazil during 2014. And by 2016, we expect to establish a footprint in the Middle East to support our customers' expansion into this region.
Clearly, our business at McCormick is well aligned with healthy category growth, and we have strong initiatives underway to drive sales. Along with these factors, an integral part of our long-term success has been our cost savings activity. As depicted on Slide 10, for the past decade, a combination of our CCI program and streamlining actions have generated significant cost savings. We've used these savings to fuel our growth through brand marketing and product development, offset material cost inflation and drive profits. In 2013, we began to go at this more aggressively with the announcement of reorganization activities in our EMEA region. This was followed in 2014 by the realignment of certain manufacturing operations in our U.S. industrial business and some additional SG&A streamlining in the fourth quarter. In 2015, we've set a goal to generate at least $85 million in cost savings, led by our CCI program. We expect additional cost savings this year as we wrap up previously announced streamlining actions. We're also taking the next step in our North American effectiveness initiative that began in 2014. Following the formation of our North American organization and leadership team, we're undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements in this part of our business. Through these actions, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $25 million by 2016.
As demonstrated in previous years, we have the ability to offset the impact of material cost increases, minimizing the profit impact on both consumer and industrial businesses. For 2015, pricing actions and anticipated cost savings will be a major offset to the higher material costs.
Let's move from sales and growth and fuel for growth to our profit performance and outlook. We met our fiscal year 2014 sales objectives and exceeded the cost savings target. However, adjusted operating income growth at 3% was below our initial range of 6% to 8%. A major reason was the more rapid growth in international markets but slower growth in our more profitable U.S. businesses. As a result, we had a lower contribution to operating income, although there was some offset at the net income line through a more favorable tax rate. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share rose 8% to $3.37. This was above our initial target, largely due to the favorable tax rate and strong growth from an unconsolidated McCormick de Mexico joint venture. As you know, our long-term goal was to grow earnings per share 9% to 11%. On a comparable basis, we've achieved a 5-year compounded annual growth rate of 8%, just below our long-term goal. 
While we've had solid sales growth, we've managed through a number of headwinds during this period, including higher-than-normal material cost inflation and retirement benefit expense. In recent years, we've taken actions to reduce retirement benefit costs, including a lump sum payout and closing our pension plans. In 2015, we expect both the retirement expense and material inflation to once again cause profit pressure, along with the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. 
We're responding to these cost pressures with more aggressive cost savings actions while continuing to invest in marketing programs and innovation. We're committed to building our brand equity and competing effectively in each of our markets. Consumer demand for flavor is increasing, and we want to help drive this growth. 
Let me summarize. I'd like to recognize employees throughout McCormick and our leadership team for their engagement and accomplishments. As we navigate through this period of competitive activity and cost inflation, we are pursuing attractive category growth opportunities in a very robust environment for flavor around the world. One of our strategic growth -- strategic imperatives is growth, to win share with global focus. And that's driving focus for me, as well as the entire organization in 2015. 
At this point, I'm going to turn it over to Gordon for a closer look at the fourth quarter and our 2015 guidance. Gordon?"

As Alan indicated, our fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded our projection with a favorable tax rate and higher joint venture income. These favorable variances more than offset a greater-than-expected decline in adjusted operating income, mainly in our consumer business. 
I'd like to comment on our sales and operating results for each segment. As seen on Slide 15, we grew consumer business sales 3% in local currency. The impact of pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix contributed to this increase. Sales in the Americas rose 4% in local currency, with the benefit of a 2% increase in volume and product mix, as well as higher pricing. 
In the third quarter, we discussed the timing of retailer purchases under our holiday display program. In 2014 versus the year-ago period, we had fewer purchases in the third quarter and more of these purchases in the fourth quarter. A look at Americas consumer business sales for the second half eliminates the impact of this year-on-year shift in sales between the third and fourth quarters. For the second half of 2014, we grew sales in local currency 2%, with pricing up 1.5% and volume and product mix up about 0.5%. This was a significant improvement from the first half when sales in local currency declined 4% due to lower volume and product mix.
In EMEA, consumer business sales in local currency were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013. We had sales pressure from competitive conditions in several markets, along with a favorable impact from higher pricing, product innovation and expanded distribution. In local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to the year-ago period. In this region, we grew sales 5% in China, offsetting weakness in Australia and India. 
In total, for the consumer business, adjusted operating income declined 4% from the fourth quarter of 2013, excluding special charges and last year's loss on voluntary pension settlement. While we grew sales and achieved CCI cost savings, we funded a $5 million increase in brand marketing support, and business mix was unfavorable.
Turning next to our industrial business. Fourth quarter sales were down slightly from the year-ago period in local currency, with lower volume and product mix largely offset by higher pricing, as seen on Slide 20. In the Americas region, we grew industrial business sales 1% in local currency. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings have been a source of strong growth. This increase, along with higher sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 2% in local currency, driven by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs. Weaker sales of branded food service products led to the decline in volume and product mix this period.
Industrial business sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the news of weak sales from the large quick-service restaurants in China, we were appropriately cautious in our fourth quarter outlook. Even with this weakness in the latter part of 2014, we grew Asia Pacific industrial sales 2% in local currency for the fiscal year. 
We were extremely pleased with the profit results for our industrial business in fiscal year 2014, with adjusted operating income up 13% from a difficult 2013 and up 10% on a 2-year comparison to 2012. We achieved higher sales and increased margins from CCI cost savings and a more favorable business mix. 
As we anticipated in our previous earnings call, fourth quarter adjusted operating income declined, mainly due to the lower volume in China, as well as a year-on-year increase in incentive compensation. 
Across both segments, adjusted operating income for the total business declined 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross profit margin was up 20 basis points, due in large part to our cost savings efforts. During the quarter, we funded $5 million of additional brand marketing programs. We recorded $3 million in special charges this quarter related to streamlining activity in EMEA and other regions.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 26%. This was above the 24% tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013, but below our guidance, due to discrete tax items. Based on our current outlook, we expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% in 2015. This range is an increase from the 26.3% tax rate for fiscal year 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose to $9 million this quarter from $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This performance was led by our joint venture in Mexico, which grew sales 8% and is operating in a new, more efficient manufacturing facility. We expect this 2014 performance to lead to higher cash dividends paid by this joint venture to McCormick and expect further profit growth as well in 2015.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.16. As you can see on Slide 28, this was a year-on-year decrease of $0.04 comprised of lower adjusted operating income and a higher tax rate, offset in part by the favorable effects of higher joint venture income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 29. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $500 million for the first time and increased $38 million from fiscal year 2013. This improvement included higher adjusted net income and a lower pension contribution in 2014. 
During 2014, we used $244 million of cash to repurchase 3.6 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $116 million still available on our $400 million authorization.
Our capital expenditures were approximately 3% of sales. Some of the larger 2014 projects included a plant expansion in Poland and plant modernization for Zatarain's production in Louisiana. Toward year end, we purchased a new office facility in Shanghai to accommodate our growth in China.
In 2015, we expect capital expenditures of $130 million to $140 million. This projection includes a new facility to accommodate the growth of our Shanghai manufacturing operations, as well as construction of a production facility in the Middle East to support the expansion of our industrial customers.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are close to our target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including acquisitions. 
I'll wrap up our remarks with McCormick's 2015 financial outlook. As Alan described, we expect solid growth in sales and profit from our consolidated operations, higher income from unconsolidated operations and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency to include higher pricing and a 2% to 4% volume increase. Based on prevailing rates, foreign currency exchange is expected to lower the sales range by 3 percentage points.
We anticipate a 4% to 5% increase in adjusted operating income from $608 million in 2014, with the projected increase driven by higher sales and at least $85 million of cost savings from both CCI and streamlining actions.
Offsets include projected mid single-digit material cost inflation, unfavorable currency exchange rates, increased retirement benefit expense and an increase of at least 5% in brand marketing. Those of you who have followed us in recent years are aware of fluctuations in retirement benefit expense, driven by the actuarial assumption for the discount rate. In 2015, we expect a $10 million increase in this expense due to a lower discount rate, along with new U.S. mortality assumptions that reflect a longer life expectancy. Keep in mind that although we expect an increase in retirement benefit expense, the cash contributions to our plans are expected to be approximately $16 million, which is close to 2014's low level of contributions. 
Our projected range for adjusted earnings per share is $3.51 to $3.58. This is an increase of 4% to 6% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.37 in 2014. Along with higher operating income, we anticipate continued growth in joint venture income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. 
At the EPS line, higher retirement benefit expense and unfavorable currency are expected to lower our year-on-year EPS growth rate by about 3%. And excluding these factors, our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance is a 7% to 9% increase. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect earnings per share to be up slightly from the year-ago period. While our tax rate should be lower than the 31% we recorded in the first quarter of 2014, we expect operating income to be under pressure from currency rates, higher brand marketing, increased retirement expense and the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for the higher dividend approved by the board in November, as well as our capital expenditures and share repurchase activity.
Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

There seems to be a bit of confusion about the pricing strategy there and what we're seeing in the Nielsen data versus the price increase that I think you mentioned this time around. We're seeing fairly sharp reductions in price per pound to the tune of about a mid single-digit rate. That -- some of that might be negative mix, which I think you mentioned. But we're also just kind of curious about what is actually happening there, not just in the quarter, but as we look out to 2015, as you take that next price increase, are you worried about further share losses to some of those smaller brands? And are you confident that the innovation that you've got in line -- in place is going to allow you to drive that mid single-digit top line growth overall?"

First, to first iterate, we've made no changes in list prices in our U.S. business. We increased prices at the end of 2013. And in 2014, we've made no changes in list prices. So a couple of things were happening. One is what we've seen is that more of our promotional spend in 2014 ended up in the second half of the year. The second is there is a sizable controlled label, which is an extreme value product, which we've had in the market with one customer for a long period of time that was pretty heavily promoted in the second half of the year. And it shows up as a McCormick brand, and it is a brand that we own, in the data. And so that is driving some of it. And then in another case, we actually took the number of units in our Recipe Inspirations from 6 spices in the line to 3 and reduced the price of that offering. So there's a good bit going on there. We don't plan any price increases at this point in our U.S. consumer business. We're dealing with some commodity inflation, with our cost reduction activities and as you saw, being more aggressive on that. But we expect to see more stable pricing in our U.S. business. Now we are taking pricing in our industrial businesses to help offset some of the commodity increases and in some of the other markets. But in our U.S. business, our plan is to hold pricing more stable."

And in a number of our markets around the world, in France, for instance, we drew -- grew share both in spices and seasonings as well as in deserts. And so we're pleased with the momentum we have there. U.K. is a little bit of a tougher competitive market. And in China, even without the acquisition, that acquisition far exceeded our expectations, but our consumer business in China has continued to grow at double digits, so we feel pretty good about that. The key effort and the thing that we have to do in order to make this plan, is really to get core growth in our U.S. business in spices and seasonings.

Can you respond to that? And how do you think about these share losses? Am I too concerned about this multiyear stretch of share losses?"

We should be able to do the sales growth that we talk about, with an acquisition or with a steady stream of acquisitions. Our acquisition record over the last couple of years has not been as consistent, so we've had -- the acquisitions we've made have been good, but we haven't done one every year, as our long-term guidance would suggest. The second thing is we've had so much volatility over the last 5 years in cost. As I said earlier, pepper's up 500% basically in the last 5 years, and so we've had to deal with a lot of that volatility. And then the other pieces are the ups and downs of things like pension expense and those sorts of things. What we're really focused on is making sure that we're running the businesses the right way, that we are driving the category and driving growth to be able to perform that way. So we do discuss the long-term goals. We lay out plans that we believe we'll hit it. And then we adjust year-on-year based on what's actually happening in our -- both our cost structure and our -- with our customers. I will say, the 1 -- the 2 changes that I think you're seeing from McCormick right now is we're being more aggressive on cost, because we recognize we have to do that. And secondly, we are being aggressive in the marketplace with our customers, in terms of bringing them ideas and bringing them lots of programs to help drive growth in the business."

McCormick's first quarter results demonstrated progress with our growth strategies and our actions to reduce cost. While sales rose 2%, the growth rate was 6% in constant currency, with a mid-single-digit increase in each of our 2 segments. These increases were largely driven by volume and product mix, special charges, along with currency and an adverse impact on our operating income results. In fact, we now anticipate a more significant impact from both special charges and currency this year, as Gordon will discuss as part of our 2015 outlook.
Excluding both of these factors, adjusted operating income rose 1%. We expect this growth rate to improve once our 2015 pricing action are fully in place and the benefits of our aggressive cost reduction activities begin to build.
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.55, and excluding special charges, grew to $0.70 from $0.62 from the year-ago period. This was largely the result of the favorable tax rate and higher income from unconsolidated operations. 
The 2014 success of our joint venture in Mexico continues in 2015, with sales up 7% and increased profit margins.
We generated strong cash flows. We kicked off the year and returned cash to shareholders through dividends and through share repurchases that lowered our average shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year. Based on these results, in our latest anything outlook, we're reaffirming our expected growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share in a constant-currency basis. Gordon will share the details of our quarterly results and outlook. I'm going to comment on each of our business segments.
First, our consumer business. We grew sales for the segment 1% and in constant currency by 5%. In the U.S., we continue to gain share of recipe mixes, while in spices and seasonings, we still see robust category growth, but we still have some work to do in this market.
Our key initiatives in North America are innovation, building brand equity, and category leadership at retail. Our innovation activity includes completing rollout of McCormick's Skillet Sauces. We're pleased with the retail acceptance and began advertising in the first quarter to build awareness in trial. The relaunch of our entire gourmet line is in full swing. Our brand-new look features greater variety, a flavor-seal versatility that locks in flavor, color and aroma, and packaging that has more premium fresh appearance. We've also achieved good retail placement for our flavored sea salts and have new varieties of old bay, saris marinades, gluten-free recipe mixes and rice mixes. As we had in the grilling season, we're gaining shelf space for a new line of Grill Mates, burger mix and sauces, and a variety of seasoning such as Blue Moon blend  leveraging the popularity of this craft beer.
We're building brand equity in our U.S. market through both digital and traditional media, and formed by our ROI analysis. We leveraged over 25 million impressions on Facebook over the holidays and our engagement rates are up 25% from a year ago. We attribute this to the strength of our community as well as the quality of our content, which includes user-generated photos and comments and step-by-step visuals. 
As for digital shopper marketing, we partnered with retailers on a first quarter big game campaign that had an above-average conversion to purchase and 20% sales increase on advertise products. And to support our upcoming grilling campaign, we are launching 2 new television ads that capture the upper compassion that consumers apply w hen grilling.
Our efforts to win at retail have included a sales force reorganization and customer category management leadership. Heading into 2015, we have a sharp focus on retail price points and are putting markdowns analytic rigor around pricing management. 
While price elasticity is low for many of our seasonal items, we have identified key staples that are price-sensitive. A major focus of our sales team is to target these key items and use existing trade promotion fronts and retailer negotiations to optimize shelf price thresholds. 
We're also leveraging our gourmet relaunch to win at retail. Third-party analysis shows that greater product assortment is beneficial to the consumer shopping experience, but too many brands can be detrimental. Specifically, an increase in McCormick's gourmet product assortment led to an 8% increase in our sales and a 5% category increase. However, a shelf set with 3 brands resulted in a 13% drop in category buyers. The message for our customers is simple: Expand their product assortment of McCormick gourmet and discontinue competitive brands.
Our win at retail effort extends to e-commerce, and we've made particularly good progress with Amazon. McCormick has gained 4 share points at Amazon in the past 12 months, and our taco seasoning mix has been recorded as the #2 item in prime pantry. Across each of these initiatives, innovation, brand building and winning at retail, we believe we have the right team in the right actions underway to improve our performance in spices and seasoning. 
For our consumer business in China, we maintained the pace of double-digit sales growth this quarter, driven by brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also are realizing sales synergies with WAPC now that the integration of this acquisition is basically complete. The opportunity for this cross-selling opportunity is illustrated on Slide 6, which depicts the core markets for our McCormick brand for the coastal regions, and our WAPC brand in Central China. Beyond China, in the U.S. we grew constant currency sales for consumer business across a number of other markets this quarter, including France, Canada, Australia and Central America.
Let's turn to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 3% and in constant currency by 7%. Each of our 3 regions had strong results. Our U.S. business led this growth with higher pricing related to commodity cost increases and increase demand for branded food service products as well as customized seasonings largely for snacks. Success with innovation and partnership with leading snack companies is part of this growth. This innovation also drove industrial sales higher in Mexico this quarter. These increases more than offset weak sales to quick-service restaurants that is extended into 2015 in the Americas.
In the EMEA, we have been growing sales to quick-service restaurants and we had a solid increase again this quarter. From facilities in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa, we supply a broad range of flavor solutions across this region. Our team in EMEA is not only growing sales, but improving profitability through greater efficiencies and a shift towards higher-margin products.
We're pleased with the return to sales growth in China, where the demand for quick-service restaurants has been volatile. In 2015, these customers are expecting a gradual improvement in sales. However, our first quarter sales rose at a double-digit rate due to a limited time menu items and increased sales of products that we manufacture in China for export to other Asian markets. Across both business segments, we continue to be encouraged by the global increase in demand for flavor. Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way people are eating today, whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients are the move towards healthier eating. These are driving strong category growth in developed markets. And in emerging markets, we've added the benefit of the rise of middle-class consumers for seeking the safety and quality of branded spices and seasonings.
This increased demand for flavor underpins the growth of our current portfolio of leading brands and the breadth of flavor solutions across the entire food industry that we provide through our industrial business. It also supports acquisitions as another avenue of growth for McCormick. We've developed a strong record of adding profitable businesses to our portfolio and we're pleased to recently announce 2 more.
In late February, we signed an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately EUR 50 million and a potential 2018 earn out payment of up to EUR 35 million. As a supplier of both branded and private label products, this business is a spice and seasoning leader in Italy, with approximately 1/3 of the category share. In addition, its products are exported to 60 other countries. We anticipate strong growth of this premium brand particularly, in the U.S. and key international markets, where consumers are seeking unique and authentic ethnic flavors. Since its founding in 1880, the owners and employees of Drogheria & Alimentari have built a great business and we look forward to working with them to achieve continued success. We expect to complete this acquisition by midyear. 
In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics for $63 [ph] million, our first industrial acquisition in quite a few years. With Brand Aromatics, we expand our breadth of flavor solutions to value-added, naturally savory flavors, marinades and broth and stock concentrates. This business has package food customers that complement McCormick's industrial customers as well as the USDA manufacturing facility, and 40 employees that include an experienced product development team. We look forward to working with the employees of Brand Aromatics to drive growth and strengthen our customer intimacy. 
Beyond these recent announcements, we're actively pursuing a strong pipeline of other acquisition opportunities. We've added resources across our business to support this activity. 
In our January call, I discussed the North American effectiveness initiative. This is more than a cost-reduction program. We currently have operating units for our consumer and industrial businesses in the U.S. and Canada that are comprised of both commercial and support functions. Through this initiative, we're moving to commercial units comprised of sales, marketing and R&D, and centralized support functions for groups like finance, human relations and supply chain. Our simplified commercial teams are focused on growth and innovation, and our support functions will be more effectively able to leverage scale and drive cost reductions.
As a part of this initiative, we are increasing spans of control and eliminating some senior positions, while adding analytical talent and new capabilities. We expect to simplify our decision-making process and execute faster to capture growth and profit opportunities. We anticipate a very good payback with an estimated annual cost savings of $25 million and charges of about $25 million. 
In just 2 months since announcing this program, we've made significant progress toward this goal. Between the EMEA project announced 18 months ago, our North American initiative and other actions, we expect to lower our annual selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 1 percentage point by 2016. We are confident that we can achieve further reductions to SG&A as a percentage of net sales through scale, our CCI program and future cost-reduction programs.
To summarize, our first quarter results have us off to great start for 2015. I'm encouraged by our strong innovation pipeline, our brand-building activity and aggressive cost-reduction efforts. And we've announced 2 acquisitions that offer great growth opportunities. I'd like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their engagement and high performance that's driving our success. 
it's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon."

I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook. We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many",1541,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook. 
We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many other U.S.-based food companies with international operations, we had a significant headwind from currency this period. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 6%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and declined 2%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved modest growth of 1%.
Let's take a look at these results for each of our 2 segments. Slide 14 shows that we grew year-on-year consumer business sales, 5% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency from the first quarter of 2014, mainly due to higher volume and product mix. As Alan indicated, the growth within core item such as recipe mixes and Grill Mates. 
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant courtesy grew 2% as a result of growth in volume and product mix. This growth was led by brands as well as other smaller markets and more than offsetting modestly declining the U.K. where we faced a challenging retail environment. 
In France, our brand marketing support and innovation drove increased sales, both on core spices and seasonings as well as homemade dessert products. 
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 10%, with a 13% increase in volume and product mix. This was led by sales in China, which rose 18%, mostly from higher volume and product mix. Constant currency sales in Australia also rose this period, while sales in India declined due in part to lower prices in the market.
In total, for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $92 million compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost, retirement benefit expense and product mix. As we indicated in our January call, the increase in retirement benefit expense is mainly due to the noncash impact of a lower discount rate and new mortality table assumptions.
Our brand marketing this period was up $1 million from the first quarter of 2014 and we also recorded $1 million in acquisition-related transaction cost for this business segment.
Turning to our industrial business. We grew first quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Higher volume and product mix contributed 4 percentage points and pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs added 3 percentage points.
In the Americas region, industrial business year-on-year sales rose 5% in constant currency, including the impact of pricing actions.
We also grew volume and product mix. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings have been a source of strong growth in this continues in 2015 with a strong pipeline of innovation. This performance, along with increased sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers. 
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 9% in constant currency with a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As Alan described, we are supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 15% in constant currency. We were particularly pleased with this performance, especially in China, given the marketplace challenges of major quick-service restaurants.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $31 million and comparable to the year-ago period. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 5%, with the benefit of higher sales in cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material cost and retirement benefit expense. 
Let's turn to Slide 24. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, was $122 million, a 2% decline from $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 1%. As we projected, gross profit margin declined year-on-year. We indicated in our January call that the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions in cost savings would be a headwind this quarter. We also recognized that the impact of our pricing actions and cost savings would build in the upcoming quarters, and we still project a slight increase in gross profit margin for the fiscal year.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses declined 40 basis points, due in part to the higher sales and scale advantage over our cost basis. 
Special charges at $28 million have exceeded our initial guidance of $20 million and we now estimate charges of $30 million for 2015. As Alan noted, we had a greater acceptance rate from our voluntary retirement program in North America and $4 million of charges from actions in EMEA.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 25% and below our guidance, due in part to discrete tax items recorded in the first quarter. This rate compared favorably to 31% in the first quarter of 2014, which included the impact of a higher tax rates in France that was subsequently reversed later in 2014. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% for 2015.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 94% to $10 million this quarter, led by an excellent performance from our joint venture in Mexico, as Alan described. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect an increase of at least 10%, which reflects our caution on the impact of currency rates on this venture. 
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter at 2015 was $0.70. As you can see on Slide 27, this was an $0.08 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate and increased income from our joint ventures.
Turning next to Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $96 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we used $65 million of cash to repurchase nearly 1 million shares of McCormick stock. at quarter end, we had $51 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. 
Early in March, we used $63 million in cash and debt to acquire Brand Aromatics. In addition, we expect to use cash and debt for the initial payment of approximately EUR 50 [ph] million when we close on the acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in mid-2015.
As we have done in the past, we expect to slow the pace of our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt to adjusted EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Even at a slower pace, we still expect to lower our shares outstanding by 1% in 2015. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well-positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. 
I'll wrap up with our latest 2015 financial outlook. We are reaffirming our expected 2015 growth rates in constant currency for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. Since the time of our 2015 financial guidance, we have increased our estimated special charges, an increase to projected unfavorable impact of currency rates. These are the primary changes to our initial guidance. 
We anticipate further currency volatility in 2015, and as necessary, we'll continue to update the impact on sales and profit. Because this is challenging to forecast, we rely on prevailing rates of the basis for our projections. 
We continue to project a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency. The acquisitions we have announced should add about 1% of growth, and these sales, along with our first quarter results, give us more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range. We now believe currency rates will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points versus our initial guidance of 3 percentage points. We expect to grow adjusted operating income 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million of adjusted operating income in 2014. While this is unchanged from our initial outlook, we have lowered our expected operating income on a reported basis to 0% to 2% from $603 million in 2014. This reflects an increased impact from unfavorable currency and an increase in special charges. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 to $3.51. This includes the increased impact of currency, and therefore, as a reduction for initial guidance. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect to grow adjusted earnings per share 6% to 8% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.28 to $3.35 compared to earnings per share $3.34 [ph] in 2014. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividends, our latest acquisitions and further share repurchase activity.

McCormick's first quarter results demonstrated progress with our growth strategies and our actions to reduce cost. While sales rose 2%, the growth rate was 6% in constant currency, with a mid-single-digit increase in each of our 2 segments. These increases were largely driven by volume and product mix. Special charges, along with currency, had an adverse impact on our operating income results. In fact, we now anticipate a more significant impact from both special charges and currency this year, as Gordon will discuss as part of our 2015 outlook.
Excluding both of these factors, adjusted operating income rose 1%. We expect this growth rate to improve once our 2015 pricing actions are fully in place and the benefits of our aggressive cost-reduction activity begin to build.
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.55, and excluding special charges, grew to $0.70 from $0.62 from the year-ago period. This was largely the result of the favorable tax rate and higher income from unconsolidated operations.
The 2014 success of our joint venture in Mexico continues in 2015, with sales up 7% and increased profit margins.
We generated strong cash flows. We kicked off the year and returned cash to shareholders through dividends and through share repurchases that lowered our average shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year. Based on these results and our latest 2015 outlook, we're reaffirming our expected growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis. Gordon will share the details of our quarterly results and outlook. I want to comment on each of our business segments.
First, our consumer business. We grew sales for this segment 1%, and in constant currency by 5%. In the U.S., we continue to gain share of recipe mixes, while in spices and seasonings, we still see robust category growth, but we still have some work to do in this market.
Our key initiatives in North America are innovation, building brand equity and category leadership at retail. Our innovation activity includes completing the rollout of McCormick's Skillet Sauces. We're pleased with the retailer acceptance and began advertising in the first quarter to build awareness and trial. The relaunch of our entire gourmet line is in full swing. Our brand-new look features greater variety, a flavor-seal technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma, and a packaging that has more premium fresh appearance.
We've also achieved good retail placement for our flavored sea salts and have new varieties of OLD BAY, Lawry's marinades, gluten-free recipe mixes and Zatarain's rice mixes. As we head into grilling season, we're gaining shelf space for our line -- new line of Grill Mates, burger mix and sauces, and a variety of seasonings such as Blue Moon blend, leveraging the popularity of this craft beer.
We're building brand equity in our U.S. market through both digital and traditional media, informed by our ROI analysis. We leveraged over 25 million impressions on Facebook over the holidays, and our engagement rates are up 25% from a year ago. We attribute this to the strength of our community, as well as the quality of our content, which includes user-generated photos and comments and step-by-step visuals.
As for digital shopper marketing, we partnered with retailers on a first quarter big game campaign that had an above-average conversion to purchase and 20% sales increase on advertised products. And to support our upcoming grilling campaign, we are launching 2 new television ads that capture the effort and passion that consumers apply when grilling.
Our efforts to win at retail have included a sales force reorganization and customer category management leadership. Heading into 2015, we have a sharp focus on retail price points and are putting more advanced analytic rigor around pricing management.
While price elasticity is low for many of our seasonal items, we've identified key staples that are price-sensitive. A major focus of our sales team is to target these key items and use existing trade promotion fronts and retailer negotiations to optimize shelf price thresholds.
We're also leveraging our gourmet relaunch to win at retail. Third-party analysis shows that greater product assortment is beneficial to the consumer shopping experience, but too many brands can be detrimental. Specifically, an increase in McCormick's gourmet product assortment led to an 8% increase in our sales and a 5% category increase. However, a shelf set with 3 brands resulted in a 13% drop in category buyers. The message for our customers is simple: Expand their product assortment of McCormick gourmet and discontinue competitive brands.
Our win at retail efforts extend to e-commerce, and we've made particularly good progress with Amazon. McCormick has gained 4 share points at Amazon in the past 12 months, and our taco seasoning mix has been reported as the #2 item in prime pantry. Across each of these initiatives, innovation, brand building and winning at retail, we believe we have the right team and the right actions underway to improve our performance in spices and seasonings.
For our consumer business in China, we maintained the pace of double-digit sales growth this quarter, driven by brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also are realizing sales synergies with WAPC, now that the integration of this acquisition is basically complete. The opportunity for this cross-selling opportunity is illustrated on Slide 6, which depicts the core markets for our McCormick brand in the coastal regions and our WAPC Daqiao brand in Central China.
Beyond China and the U.S., we grew constant currency sales for our consumer business across a number of other markets this quarter, including France, Canada, Australia and Central America.
Let's turn to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 3%, and in constant currency by 7%. Each of our 3 regions had strong results. Our U.S. business led this growth with higher pricing related to commodity cost increases and increased demand for our branded food service products, as well as customized seasonings, largely for snacks.
Success with innovation in partnership with leading snack companies was part of this growth. This innovation also drove industrial sales higher in Mexico this quarter. These increases more than offset weak sales to quick-service restaurants that is extended into 2015 in the Americas.
In EMEA, we have been growing sales to quick-service restaurants and we had a solid increase again this quarter. From facilities in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa, we supply a broad range of flavor solutions across this region. Our team in EMEA is not only growing sales, but improving profitability through greater efficiencies and a shift towards higher-margin products.
We're pleased with the return to sales growth in China, where the demand from quick-service restaurants has been volatile. In 2015, these customers are expecting a gradual improvement in sales. However, our first quarter sales rose at a double-digit rate due to a new limited-time menu items and increased sales of products that we manufacture in China for export to other Asian markets. Across both business segments, we continue to be encouraged by the global increase in demand for flavor.
Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way people are eating today. Whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients are the move towards healthier eating. These are driving strong category growth rates in developed markets. And in emerging markets, we've added the benefit of the rise of middle-class consumers for seeking the safety and quality of branded spices and seasonings.
This increased demand for flavor underpins the growth of our current portfolio of leading brands and the breadth of flavor solutions across the entire food industry that we provide through our industrial business. It also supports acquisitions as another avenue of growth for McCormick. We've developed a strong record of adding profitable businesses to our portfolio, and we're pleased to recently announce 2 more.
In late February, we signed an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately EUR 50 million and a potential 2018 earn-out payment of up to EUR 35 million. As a supplier of both brand and private label products, this business is a spice and seasoning leader in Italy, with approximately 1/3 of the category share. In addition, its products are exported to 60 other countries. We anticipate strong growth of this premium brand, particularly in the U.S. and key international markets where consumers are seeking unique and authentic ethnic flavors.
Since its founding in 1880, the owners and employees of Drogheria & Alimentari have built a great business, and we look forward to working with them to achieve continued success. We expect to complete this acquisition by midyear.
In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics for $63 million, our first industrial acquisition in quite a few years. With Brand Aromatics, we expand our breadth of flavor solutions to value-added, natural-savory flavors, marinades and broth and stock concentrates. This business has packaged food customers that complement McCormick's industrial customers, as well as the USDA manufacturing facility and 40 employees that include an experienced product development team. We look forward to working with the employees of Brand Aromatics to drive growth and strengthen our customer intimacy.
Beyond these recent announcements, we're actively pursuing a strong pipeline of other acquisition opportunities. We've added resources across our business to support this activity.
In our January call, I discussed the North American effectiveness initiative. This is more than a cost-reduction program. We currently have operating units for our consumer and industrial businesses in the U.S. and Canada that are comprised of both commercial and support functions. Through this initiative, we're moving to commercial units comprised of sales, marketing and R&D, and centralized support functions for groups like finance, human relations and supply chain. Our simplified commercial teams are focused on growth and innovation, and our support functions will be more effectively able to leverage scale and drive cost reductions.
As a part of this initiative, we are increasing spans of control and eliminating some senior positions, while adding analytical talent and new capabilities. We expect to simplify our decision-making process and execute faster to capture growth and profit opportunities. We anticipate a very good payback, with an estimated annual cost savings of $25 million and charges of about $25 million. In just 2 months since announcing this program, we've made significant progress toward this goal.
Between the EMEA project announced 18 months ago, our North American initiative and other actions, we expect to lower our annual selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 1 percentage point by 2016. We are confident that we can achieve further reductions to SG&A as a percentage of net sales through scale, our CCI program and future cost-reduction programs.
To summarize, our first quarter results have us off to a great start in 2015. I'm encouraged by our strong innovation pipeline, our brand-building activity and aggressive cost-reduction efforts. And we've announced 2 acquisitions that offer great growth opportunities. I'd like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their engagement and high performance that's driving our success.

I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook.We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many",1543,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook.
We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many other U.S.-based food companies with international operations, we had a significant headwind from currency this period. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 6%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and declined 2%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved modest growth of 1%.
Let's take a look at these results for each of our 2 segments. Slide 14 shows that we grew year-on-year consumer business sales 5% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency from the first quarter of 2014, mainly due to higher volume and product mix. As Alan indicated, the growth was in core items such as recipe mixes and Grill Mates.
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant courtesy grew 2% as a result of growth in volume and product mix. This growth was led by France, as well as other smaller markets, and more than offsetting modest volume decline in the U.K. where we faced a challenging retail environment.
In France, our brand marketing support and innovation drove increased sales both at core spices and seasonings, as well as homemade dessert products.
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 10%, with a 13% increase in volume and product mix. This was led by sales in China, which rose 18%, mostly from higher volume and product mix. Constant currency sales in Australia also rose this period, while sales in India declined due in part to lower prices in the market.
In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $92 million compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings, offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost, retirement benefit expense and product mix. As we indicated in our January call, the increase in retirement benefit expense is mainly due to the noncash impact of a lower discount rate and new mortality table assumptions.
Our brand marketing this period was up $1 million from the first quarter of 2014, and we also recorded $1 million in acquisition-related transaction cost for this business segment.
Turning to our industrial business, we grew first quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Higher volume and product mix contributed 4 percentage points, and pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs added 3 percentage points.
In the Americas region, industrial business year-on-year sales rose 5% in constant currency, including the impact of pricing actions. We also grew volume and product mix. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings have been a source of strong growth, and this continues in 2015 with a strong pipeline of innovation. This performance, along with increased sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 9% in constant currency, with a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As Alan described, we are supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 15% in constant currency. We were particularly pleased with this performance, especially in China, given the marketplace challenges of major quick-service restaurants.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $31 million and comparable to the year-ago period. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 5%, with the benefit of higher sales in cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.
Let's turn to Slide 24. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, was $122 million, a 2% decline from $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 1%.
As we projected, gross profit margin declined year-on-year. We indicated in our January call that the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions and cost savings would be a headwind this quarter. We also recognized that the impact of our pricing actions and cost savings would build in the upcoming quarters, and we still project a slight increase in gross profit margin for the fiscal year.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 40 basis points, due in part to the higher sales and scale advantage over our cost bases.
Special charges at $28 million have exceeded our initial guidance of $20 million, and we now estimate charges of $30 million for 2015. As Alan noted, we had a greater acceptance rate from our voluntary retirement program in North America and $4 million of charges from an action in EMEA.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 25% and below our guidance, due in part to discrete tax items recorded in the first quarter. This rate compared favorably to 31% in the first quarter of 2014, which included the impact of a higher tax rate in France that was subsequently reversed later in 2014. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% for 2015.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 94% to $10 million this quarter, led by an excellent performance from our joint venture in Mexico, as Alan described. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect an increase of at least 10%, which reflects our caution on the impact of currency rates on this venture.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 was $0.70. As you can see on Slide 27, this was an $0.08 year-on-year increase, led by the lower tax rate and increased income from our joint ventures.
Turning next to Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $96 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we used $65 million of cash to repurchase nearly 1 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $51 million remaining on our $400 million authorization.
Early in March, we used $63 million in cash and debt to acquire Brand Aromatics. In addition, we expect to use cash and debt for the initial payment of approximately EUR 50 million when we close on the acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in mid-2015.
As we have done in the past, we expect to slow the pace of our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Even at a slower pace, we still expect to lower our shares outstanding by 1% in 2015. Our balance sheet remains sound, we are generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.
I'll wrap up with our latest 2015 financial outlook. We are reaffirming our expected 2015 growth rate in constant currency for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. Since the time of our 2015 financial guidance, we have increased our estimated special charges and increased the projected unfavorable impact of currency rates. These are the primary changes to our initial guidance.
We anticipate further currency volatility in 2015, and as necessary, we'll continue to update the impact on sales and profit. Because this is challenging to forecast, we rely on prevailing rates as the basis for our projections.
We continue to project a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency. The acquisitions we have announced should add about 1% of growth, and these sales, along with our first quarter results, give us more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range. We now believe currency rates will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points versus our initial guidance of 3 percentage points.
We expect to grow adjusted operating income 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million of adjusted operating income in 2014. While this is unchanged from our initial outlook, we have lowered our expected operating income on a reported basis to 0% to 2% from $603 million in 2014. This reflects an increased impact from unfavorable currency and an increase in special charges.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 to $3.51. This includes the increased impact of currency, and therefore, is a reduction from our initial guidance. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect to grow adjusted earnings per share 6% to 8% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.28 to $3.35 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our latest acquisitions and further share repurchase activity.
Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

McCormick's first quarter results demonstrated progress with our growth strategies and our actions to reduce cost. While sales rose 2%, the growth rate was 6% in constant currency, with a mid-single digit increase in each of our 2 segments. These increases were largely driven by volume and product mix. Special charges, along with currency, had an adverse impact on our operating income result. In fact, we now anticipate a more significant impact from both special charges and currency this year, as Gordon will discuss as part of our 2015 outlook.
Excluding both of these factors, adjusted operating income rose 1%. We expect this growth rate to improve once our 2015 pricing actions are fully in place and the benefits of our aggressive cost-reduction activity begin to build.
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.55, and excluding special charges, grew to $0.70 from $0.62 in the year-ago period. This was largely the result of a favorable tax rate and higher income from unconsolidated operations.
The 2014 success of our joint venture in Mexico continues in 2015, with sales up 7% and increased profit margins.
We generated strong cash flow as we kicked off the year and returned cash to shareholders through dividends and through share repurchases that lowered our average shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year. Based on these results and our latest 2015 outlook, we're reaffirming our expected growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis. Gordon will share the details of our quarterly results and outlook. 
I want to comment on each of our business segments. First, our consumer business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and, in constant currency, by 5%. In the U.S., we continue to gain share of recipe mixes, while in spices and seasonings, we still see robust category growth, but we still have some work to do in this market.
Our key initiatives in North America are innovation, building brand equity and category leadership at retail. Our innovation activity includes completing the rollout of McCormick's Skillet Sauces. We're pleased with the retailer acceptance and began advertising in the first quarter to build awareness and trial. The relaunch of our entire gourmet line is in full swing. Our brand-new look features greater variety, a flavor-seal technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma, and a packaging that has more premium fresh appearance.
We've also achieved good retail placement for our flavored sea salts and have new varieties of OLD BAY, Lawry's marinades, gluten-free recipe mixes and Zatarain's rice mixes. As we head into grilling season, we're gaining shelf space for our line -- new line of Grill Mates, burger mix and sauces, and a variety of seasonings such as Blue Moon blend, leveraging the popularity of this craft beer.
We're building brand equity in our U.S. market through both digital and traditional media, informed by our ROI analysis. We leveraged over 25 million impressions on Facebook over the holidays, and our engagement rates are up 25% from a year ago. We attribute this to the strength of our community, as well as the quality of our content, which includes user-generated photos and comments and step-by-step visuals.
As for digital shopper marketing, we partnered with retailers on a first quarter big game campaign that had an above-average conversion to purchase and 20% sales increase on advertised products. And to support our upcoming grilling campaign, we are launching 2 new television ads that capture the effort and passion that consumers apply when grilling.
Our efforts to win at retail have included a sales force reorganization and customer category management leadership. Heading into 2015, we have a sharp focus on retail price points and are putting more advanced analytic rigor around pricing management.
While price elasticity is low for many of our seasonal items, we've identified key staples that are price-sensitive. A major focus of our sales team is to target these key items and use existing trade promotion fronts and retailer negotiations to optimize shelf price thresholds.
We're also leveraging our gourmet relaunch to win at retail. Third-party analysis shows that greater product assortment is beneficial to the consumer shopping experience, but too many brands can be detrimental. Specifically, an increase in McCormick's gourmet product assortment led to an 8% increase in our sales and a 5% category increase. However, a shelf set with 3 brands resulted in a 13% drop in category buyers. The message for our customers is simple: Expand their product assortment of McCormick gourmet and discontinue competitive brands.
Our win at retail efforts extend to e-commerce, and we've made particularly good progress with Amazon. McCormick has gained 4 share points at Amazon in the past 12 months, and our taco seasoning mix has been reported as the #2 item in prime pantry. Across each of these initiatives, innovation, brand building and winning at retail, we believe we have the right team and the right actions underway to improve our performance in spices and seasonings.
For our consumer business in China, we maintained the pace of double-digit sales growth this quarter, driven by brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also are realizing sales synergies with WAPC, now that the integration of this acquisition is basically complete. The opportunity for this cross-selling opportunity is illustrated on Slide 6, which depicts the core markets for our McCormick brand in the coastal regions and our WAPC Daqiao brand in Central China.
Beyond China and the U.S., we grew constant-currency sales for our consumer business across a number of other markets this quarter, including France, Canada, Australia and Central America.
Let's turn to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 3% and, in constant currency, by 7%. Each of our 3 regions had strong results. Our U.S. business led this growth with higher pricing related to commodity cost increases and increased demand for our branded food service products, as well as customized seasonings, largely for snacks.
Success with innovation in partnership with leading snack companies was part of this growth. This innovation also drove industrial sales higher in Mexico this quarter. These increases more than offset weak sales to quick-service restaurants that is extended into 2015 in the Americas.
In EMEA, we have been growing sales to quick-service restaurants and we had a solid increase again this quarter. From facilities in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa, we supply a broad range of flavor solutions across this region. Our team in EMEA is not only growing sales, but improving profitability through greater efficiencies and a shift towards higher-margin products.
We're pleased with the return to sales growth in China, where the demand from quick-service restaurants has been volatile. In 2015, these customers are expecting a gradual improvement in sales. However, our first quarter sales rose at a double-digit rate due to a new limited-time menu items and increased sales of products that we manufacture in China for export to other Asian markets. Across both business segments, we continue to be encouraged by the global increase in demand for flavor.
Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way people are eating today; whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients are the move toward healthier eating. These are driving strong category growth rates in developed markets. And in emerging markets, we've added the benefit of the rise of middle-class consumers for seeking the safety and quality of branded spices and seasonings.
This increased demand for flavor underpins the growth of our current portfolio of leading brands and the breadth of flavor solutions across the entire food industry that we provide through our industrial business. It also supports acquisitions as another avenue of growth for McCormick. We've developed a strong record of adding profitable businesses to our portfolio, and we're pleased to recently announce 2 more.
In late February, we signed an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately EUR 50 million and a potential 2018 earn-out payment of up to EUR 35 million. As a supplier of both brand and private-label products, this business is a spice and seasoning leader in Italy, with approximately 1/3 of the category share. In addition, its products are exported to 60 other countries. We anticipate strong growth of this premium brand, particularly in the U.S. and key international markets, where consumers are seeking unique and authentic ethnic flavors.
Since its founding in 1880, the owners and employees of Drogheria & Alimentari have built a great business, and we look forward to working with them to achieve continued success. We expect to complete this acquisition by midyear.
In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics for $63 million, our first industrial acquisition in quite a few years. With Brand Aromatics, we expand our breadth of flavor solutions to value-added, natural-savory flavors, marinades and broth and stock concentrates. This business has packaged food customers that complement McCormick's industrial customers, as well as the USDA manufacturing facility and 40 employees that include an experienced product development team. We look forward to working with the employees of Brand Aromatics to drive growth and strengthen our customer intimacy.
Beyond these recent announcements, we're actively pursuing a strong pipeline of other acquisition opportunities. We've added resources across our business to support this activity.
In our January call, I discussed the North American effectiveness initiative. This is more than a cost-reduction program. We currently have operating units for our consumer and industrial businesses in the U.S. and Canada that are comprised of both commercial and support functions. Through this initiative, we're moving to commercial units comprised of sales, marketing and R&D, and centralized support functions for groups like finance, human relations and supply chain. Our simplified commercial teams are focused on growth and innovation, and our support functions will be more effectively able to leverage scale and drive cost reductions.
As a part of this initiative, we are increasing spans of control and eliminating some senior positions, while adding analytical talent and new capabilities. We expect to simplify our decision-making process and execute faster to capture growth and profit opportunities. We anticipate a very good payback, with an estimated annual cost savings of $25 million and charges of about $25 million. In just 2 months since announcing this program, we've made significant progress toward this goal.
Between the EMEA project announced 18 months ago, our North American initiative and other actions, we expect to lower our annual selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 1 percentage point by 2016. We are confident that we can achieve further reductions to SG&A as a percentage of net sales through scale, our CCI program and future cost-reduction programs.
To summarize, our first quarter results have us off to a great start in 2015. I'm encouraged by our strong innovation pipeline, our brand-building activity and aggressive cost-reduction efforts. And we've announced 2 acquisitions that offer great growth opportunities. I'd like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their engagement and high performance that's driving our success.
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon."
181176,287977051,785429,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2015",2015-03-24,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook.We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many",1542,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook.
We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many other U.S.-based food companies with international operations, we had a significant headwind from currency this period. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 6%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and declined 2%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved modest growth of 1%.
Let's take a look at these results for each of our 2 segments. Slide 14 shows that we grew year-on-year consumer business sales 5% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency from the first quarter of 2014, mainly due to higher volume and product mix. As Alan indicated, the growth was in core items such as recipe mixes and Grill Mates.
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant courtesy grew 2% as a result of growth in volume and product mix. This growth was led by France, as well as other smaller markets, and more than offsetting modest volume decline in the U.K. where we face a challenging retail environment.
In France, our brand marketing support and innovation drove increased sales both at core spices and seasonings, as well as homemade dessert products.
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 10%, with a 13% increase in volume and product mix. This was led by sales in China, which rose 18%, mostly from higher volume and product mix. Constant-currency sales in Australia also rose this period, while sales in India declined due in part to lower prices in the market.
In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $92 million compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost, retirement benefit expense and product mix. As we indicated in our January call, the increase in retirement benefit expense is mainly due to the noncash impact of a lower discount rate and new mortality table assumptions.
Our brand marketing this period was up $1 million from the first quarter of 2014, and we also recorded $1 million in acquisition-related transaction cost for this business segment.
Turning to our industrial business, we grew first quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Higher volume and product mix contributed 4 percentage points, and pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs added 3 percentage points.
In the Americas region, industrial business year-on-year sales rose 5% in constant currency, including the impact of pricing actions. We also grew volume and product mix. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings had been a source of strong growth, and this continues in 2015 with a strong pipeline of innovation. This performance, along with increased sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 9% in constant currency, with a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As Alan described, we are supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 15% in constant currency. We were particularly pleased with this performance, especially in China, given the marketplace challenges of major quick-service restaurants.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $31 million and comparable to the year-ago period. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 5%, with the benefit of higher sales and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.
Let's turn to Slide 24. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, was $122 million, a 2% decline from $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 1%.
As we projected, gross profit margin declined year-on-year. We indicated in our January call that the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions and cost savings would be a headwind this quarter. We also recognized that the impact of our pricing actions and cost savings would build in the upcoming quarters, and we still project a slight increase in gross profit margin for the fiscal year.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 40 basis points, due in part to the higher sales and scale advantage over our cost bases.
Special charges at $28 million have exceeded our initial guidance of $20 million, and we now estimate charges of $30 million for 2015. As Alan noted, we had a greater acceptance rate from our voluntary retirement program in North America and $4 million of charges from an action in EMEA.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 25% and below our guidance, due in part to discrete tax items recorded in the first quarter. This rate compared favorably to 31% in the first quarter of 2014, which included the impact of a higher tax rate in France that was subsequently reversed later in 2014. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% for 2015.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 94% to $10 million this quarter, led by an excellent performance from our joint venture in Mexico, as Alan described. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect an increase of at least 10%, which reflects our caution on the impact of currency rates on this venture.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 was $0.70. As you can see on Slide 27, this was an $0.08 year-on-year increase, led by the lower tax rate and increased income from our joint ventures.
Turning next to Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $96 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we used $65 million of cash to repurchase nearly 1 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $51 million remaining on our $400 million authorization.
Early in March, we used $63 million in cash and debt to acquire Brand Aromatics. In addition, we expect to use cash and debt for the initial payment of approximately EUR 50 million when we close on the acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in mid-2015.
As we have done in the past, we expect to slow the pace of our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Even at a slower pace, we still expect to lower our shares outstanding by 1% in 2015. Our balance sheet remains sound, we are generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.
I'll wrap up with our latest 2015 financial outlook. We are reaffirming our expected 2015 growth rate in constant currency for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. Since the time of our 2015 financial guidance, we have increased our estimated special charges and increased the projected unfavorable impact of currency rates. These are the primary changes to our initial guidance.
We anticipate further currency volatility in 2015 and, as necessary, will continue to update the impact on sales and profit. Because this is challenging to forecast, we rely on prevailing rates as the basis for our projections.
We continue to project a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency. The acquisitions we have announced should add about 1% of growth, and these sales, along with our first quarter results, give us more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range. We now believe currency rates will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points versus our initial guidance of 3 percentage points.
We expect to grow adjusted operating income 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million of adjusted operating income in 2014. While this is unchanged from our initial outlook, we have lowered our expected operating income on a reported basis to 0% to 2% from $603 million in 2014. This reflects an increased impact from unfavorable currency and an increase in special charges.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 to $3.51. This includes the increased impact of currency and, therefore, is a reduction from our initial guidance. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect to grow adjusted earnings per share 6% to 8% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.28 to $3.35 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our latest acquisitions and further share repurchase activity.
Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

McCormick's second quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies, and continued the momentum that we established in the first quarter. While sales declined 1%, in constant currency, we achieved a 5% year-on-year increase. We achieved higher constant currency sales in both our business segments and across geographic regions, a very good performance from our business leaders and employees throughout McCormick.
Based on this broad-based growth and our outlook for the second half of 2015, we reaffirm our projection for 4% to 6% constant currency sales growth for the fiscal year. In fact, this year's pace of acquisition activity, gives us more confidence at the upper end of the range.

This improvement from the first quarter adjusted operating income currency rose [Audio Gap]. As we anticipated, profit growth is improving us our build as an additional pricing actions go into effect. This improvement supports our reaffirm [Audio Gap] for 6% to 7% operating income growth in 2015 on a constant currency basis.
From the very favorable tax rate variance, second quarter earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share this period was $0.65, and excluding special charges, grew to $0.75 from $0.64 in the year-ago period. In addition to the favorable tax rate, other positive factors included the increase in adjusted operating income, further growth from our joint venture in Mexico, and lower shares outstanding. This EPS result includes the impact of unfavorable currency.
We have raced our latest earnings per share guidance to reflect the net impact of a favorable tax rate in the second quarter and our estimated tax rate for the second half. Aside from this tax adjustment, we feel just as confident in our base business EPS outlook.
Cash flow from our operations remain strong and $186 million, supporting our dividend program, along with business growth strategies, including acquisitions. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for focusing on growth, driving high-performance, and engaging in our success.
Next, Lawrence is going to provide an update of each of our 2 business segments. Lawrence?"

As Alan indicated, we delivered constant currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses, with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. Let's start with the consumer",1660,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan indicated, we delivered constant currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses, with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. Let's start with the consumer business.
Across our entire consumer business, although we reported a sales decline of 3%, in constant currency, we achieved a 3% increase. I'll comment first on the strong results in certain international markets, then turn to the U.S. market for more detailed remarks.
Turn, our Consumer business sales growth again this quarter, with a double-digit increase in constant currency. We had strong demand for McCormick brand herbs and spices, condiments and Seasoning Blends, driven by our brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also grew sales with the introduction of our McCormick brand product into central China, part of the sales Energy East from our Wuhuan Asia/Pacific condiments acquisition.
In Europe/Middle East/Africa, EMEA, the economic and retail conditions remain challenging in parts of the region. However, in constant currency, we had strong volume-driven sales growth this period, particularly in France, Poland and Russia. 
In France, we're benefiting from brand marketing, and have expanded the co-brand sales with a discount retailer. Distribution gains are also our primary sales growth driver for our business in Poland and Russia. 
And then Australia, Consumer sales in constant currency rose at a double-digit rate this period from new distribution and product innovation.
Before moving to the Americas, let's take a look at our lineup of new products for the second half in our EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions on Slide 7. One of our global initiatives is growing. 
In EMEA, we are building out our basis points products in the U.K., France, Poland and other markets, with dry seasonings, wet marinades and sauces, and in France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, recognizing the popularity of burgers, where we're introducing restaurant quality burger seasonings in wet and dry sachets. 
Our Aeroplane gelatin in Australia is an iconic brand, with 90% category share, and we are continuing to grow sales with new flavor varieties.
Also in this market, we will be leveraging the authenticity of our teens brand into curry recipe basis. 
Let's turn to the Americas. In this region, we're making further progress in improving the performance of our U.S. Consumer business. Consumer interest in flavor, simple a healthy ingredients and cooking with fresh products, continues to drive a strong category [Audio Gap] for spices and seasoning in the latest consumption data, with category sales up 5% in the quarter. This same data shows that sales of our McCormick brand spices and seasonings, rose 1%. This is an improvement compared to 1% decline in the past 52 weeks. We are definitely heading in the right direction.
Our recipe mixes, our next largest category, we continue to gain share. In this latest quarter, the increase of 50 [ph] basis points, and we marked the 20th consecutive month of share gain. We're achieving this through innovation, as well as effective marketing for both new products and core items. Within the subsegment of taco seasoning mixes, we increased share of our McCormick brand's 3 percentage points in the last 52 weeks, and our share of chili seasoning mixes, is up 4 percentage points. 
We grew share of Zatarain's 5% this quarter versus the year-ago period. Zatarain's Rice mixes are outpacing the category growth rate, and consumption of our frozen entrées rose 4%. Across all of our U.S. brands, we are driving growth through accelerating innovation, building brand equity and through our category leadership at retail.
On the innovation front, I'll comment on 2 of our recent launches. I'm pleased to report that in less than 1 year, our McCormick Skillet Sauces have exceeded 10% share in this growing category, driven by the retail placement we have gained and our marketing support. 
The relaunch of our gourmet line begin early in 2015 with greater variety of flavor sealed technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has
[Audio Gap]
and appearance.
In this subsegment of the spice and seasoning category, nearly 80% of retail distribution points are now converted to the new packaging, and we've seen based consumption chance for McCormick gourmet strengthen, with consumption up 4% in the second quarter.  This gourmet initiative has also helped us expand the number of McCormick brand SKUs on the shelves with existing customers, again distribution with new customers, and of other customers reduced the number of competitive brands they carry. 
For the second half of 2015, we are excited about our integration plans. These include extending our liquid recipe mixes platform with the introduction of a slow cooker sauces. Flavors include Smoky barbecue, pulled pork and pot roast with caramelized onion and cracked black pepper. We will introduce additional gluten-free recipe mixes within Beef Stew and Fajita, to build off the success of our initial varieties.
In Kitchen Basics the convenient way to boost flavor for soups and stews and risotos, with no MSG or artificial flavors, including a vegetarian very. 
Also, in the Americas region, our launch plans in Canada include additional Skillet Sauces, gluten-free recipe mixes and reduced sodium items. And in Latin America, we were introducing mustard flavors and barbecue sauces. 
A second growth initiative in the U.S. is building brand equity. We have particular since this quarter with our Grill Mates campaign, including excellent in-store display execution, great new television advertising and a 2015 Grilling Flavor Forecast. Second quarter sales of Grill Mates grew 9%, and we expect to maintain this momentum through the peak grilling season.
Through digital marketing, we're connecting directly with consumers. We're moving up the list of go to places for online recipe. mccormick.com is now in the top 40 recipe destinations, up from 175th in 2012, with 30 million annual visitors and 40 million recipe views. We have the largest online grilling community, and are connecting with passionate users of OLD BAY, Zatarain's and other distinctive brands.
And behind the scenes, we have better aligned with our digital assets, not only the U.S. but all around the world. 
We continue to strengthen our retail partnership to drive category growth and engage consumers. On the last call, Alan discuss the sharper focus on our retail price points and advanced analytic rigor around category management. As we roll this out, several retailers have begun to partner with us on shelf price adjustments and we're very encouraged by the results for them and for McCormick. At the end of the third quarter, we will be ready to launch a new comprehensive category management tool, supported by additional internal resources, and we expect these capabilities to accelerate our progress as it relates to pricing optimization.
As you would expect, this is an account by account discussion. As the latest consumption data illustrated, we have reduced the category share decline for our brand, but we're not yet where we want to be. I believe we have the right actions and the right team in place to stabilize and then grow our share. 
In tandem with these actions, we are driving growth for our recipe mixes as well as niche brands within our U.S. portfolio such as Lawries, OLD BAY, Grill Mates, Zatarain's, Thai Kitchen, and now, Gentoo and Elementary. 
Before I move to our Industrial business, I just want to reduce size the good performance of our joint venture in Mexico. Despite an unfavorable currency rate, net income for this business rose [ph] 30 [ph] [Audio Gap] sales favorable cost 
Turning now to our industrial business. [Audio Gap] and in constant currency, 87% [ph]. These higher [Audio Gap] and our cost-reduction initiatives, led to a double-digit increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency. 
EMEA led the growth this period, with a double-digit constant currency sales increase, and volume and product mix up 9%. This part of our business has had exceptional sales growth for the past 3 years, as seen on Slide 11. Whereas, our business with quick service restaurants has been a challenge in other regions during this period, we are winning in EMEA with product innovation, and for the third year in a row, we're named new product Supplier of the Year in this region, by a leading quick service restaurant customer.
We also increased our share of business with quick service restaurants, and are supporting the geographic expansion of those customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with food manufacturers we supply. And as an example of broking ground on new facility in the Middle East. 
In the Americas region, we are benefiting from an increase in consumer snacking, developing seasonings for snack bars, crackers, chips and similar products. At the same time, our customers are moving toward more simple ingredients, and our foundation in spices and herbs is well positioned. In the second quarter, we had particularly strong demand from these customers in Latin America, with double-digit sales growth in constant currency. We have a strong base in Mexico, and are supporting customer expansion into South America. 
In Brazil, we cut the ribbon on a small R&D center this quarter, to build our expertise in the local flavors. 
We also grew year-on-year sales to food manufacturers in the U.S. this quarter, and had a solid performance with sales of branded food service products. In addition, we had the benefit of sales from Brand Aromatics, acquired early in March. Offsetting a portion of these gains, was further weakness in our U.S. sales to quick service restaurants. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, we're pleased to be seeing for the recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants. As in the first quarter, we had an added benefit of innovation in limited time offers, and with export sales of products supplied by our facilities in China. Our outlook is for continued improvement through the second half of 2015 for our industrial business in China.
Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back over to Alan."

As Lawrence reported, we're driving solid performance across many parts of our business, demonstrating the effectiveness of our growth strategies and our strong execution.
We're making steady progress with our initiatives, and encouraged by 2015 results through the first half. Next, I'd like to provide a few updates from the timing of our first quarter earnings call back in late March, starting with acquisition activity. McCormick's business development team is having a busy year with great results. Back in February, we announced an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari, and completed this purchase at the end of May. 
In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics. And about a week ago, we signed an agreement to acquire One World Foods, Stubb's, the #1 brand of premium, authentic barbecue sauce in the U.S. Stubb's products also include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Annual sales of this business are approximately $30 million, and are growing at a double-digit rate.
Stubb's is a perfect cop limits our products, rounding out our range of grilling items, under the Grill Mates, Lawries and McCormick brands. To maintain the authenticity of this brand, we plan to keep the business headquarters in Austin, Texas. We expect to maintain a double-digit pace of sales growth near-term through expanded distribution, increased household penetration and innovative flavors.
We anticipate significant cost synergies that will deliver at least $10 million of incremental EBITDA by 2017. And then an anticipated purchase price of a $100 million, we expect an Stubb's to be another time attractive deal for McCormick.
Along with our efforts to build sales through acquisitions in the innovation and brand marketing activity that Lawrence discussed, employees throughout the company in are great progress with our efforts to eliminate costs. We reaffirm our goal to achieve at least $85 million in cost savings this year. This will bring our cumulative annual cost savings to more than $400 million since our 2009 launch of McCormick's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI. 
During the second quarter, we announced additional reorganization plans in the EMEA region. These plans include the transfer of certain additional activities to the recently established McCormick shared services center in Poland. While we expect to record charges of approximately $25 million related to these actions, there's a very good payback, with estimated annual cost savings of $16 million by the end of 2017.
We have recently increased our resources to drive our CCI program, and expect to continue our track record of productivity improvement throughout the organization.
Let's turn to some recent leadership changes. As announced in early June, we're pleased to have Maritza Montiel and Michael Conway joining our board. Maritza is former deputy CEO and Vice Chairman of Deloitte. During her 40 years into the firm, she led a variety of strategic initiatives prior to retiring in mid-2014.
Michael is President of global channel development for Starbucks. His responsibility for all commercial and business strategy functions is driving aggressive plans to expand their emerging, international markets. Prior to Starbucks, Michael served in leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson and Campbell's Soup.
Now retiring from our board is JP Bill Day, Chairman, President and CEO of Hershey. He served as director since 2005, and we truly appreciate his participation and contribution to our success.
Turning to our company leaders. Cecile Perich, Senior VP of Human Resources Command, retired for McCormick after 32 years of exemplary service, and 7 years as a member of our management committee. On Slide 17, we've listed the current members of the management committee, which now include Lisa Manzone, who is promoted to role, and also Brendan Foley, who joined us from Heins about a year ago, and whose responsibilities have been broadened, from head of U.S. consumer business to a North American role.
We also announced in April that Nneka Rimmer has joined the company, most recently with Boston Consulting Group, Nneka's responsible for shaping overall corporate strategies and working to increase EVA at McCormick. I'm confident that these latest changes will provide strong leadership for our business going forward.
The last topic I want to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to the healthfulness of spices and herbs. Since its formation in 2007, the McCormick Science Institute, MSI, has supported scientific research and dissemination of information on the health benefits of culinary herbs and spices. In 2014, MSI, in partnership with the American Society for nutrition, hosted a summit of researchers, government officials, and health and wellness communicators to discuss the role of herbs and spices and healthy diet. This message is beginning to resonate. 
In May, we were pleased to learn that the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, has recommended to the government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encourage uses of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. We're optimistic that this change will be made.
In addition, Australia is healthy eating pyramid was recently updated, and now encourages people to enjoy herbs and spices to flavor food without using salt. We regard our categories as advantaged: On trend with spicy foods, fresh foods, ethnic cuisine, simple ingredient. This latest health news, is just 1 more reason for consumers to turn to spices and herbs to add flavor. 
It's now my pleasure to turn over to Gordon for a financial perspective on our results and guidance."

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments, and in both developed and emerging markets. On a constant currency basis, the u",1626,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments, and in both developed and emerging markets. 
On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 5%. Our adjusted operating income, excludes special charges and rose 1%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved 7% growth, a sequential improvement from the first quarter results.
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew second quarter consumer business sales 3% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2014, with contributions from higher volume and product mix, as well as pricing actions, mainly related to honey products in Canada. 
As Lawrence described, we grew U.S. sales of recipe mixes, Grill Mates and Zatarain's products. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America grew at a double-digit rate this period as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant currency grew 4% as a result of higher volume and product mix. Distribution gains were a major reason for the increase, with wins in France, Poland and Russia. Our brand marketing and innovation are additional factors driving sales, and we look forward to including sales of Drogheria & Alimentari in our results starting in the third quarter.
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 7%, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. Our sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate year-on-year. 
And Australia also delivered a double-digit increase for the second quarter. We had some further pressure from basmati rice prices in India, leading to lower pricing for the region this period.
And total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $81 million, compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost, retirement benefit expense and product mix. 
Also in the second quarter, we recorded about $1 million of transaction costs related to the acquisitions we have announced in 2015.
Turning to our industrial business. We grew second quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix, each added 3 percentage points in acquisitions, another 1 percentage point of growth. 
In the Americas region, sales rose 5% in constant currency, mainly from pricing actions and the addition of Brand Aromatics. Volume and product mix were comparable to the year-ago period, as increased sales of snack seasonings, particularly, in Latin America. And higher sales of branded food service products were offset by continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales of 12% in constant currency, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. As Lawrence described, we are in our third year exceptional performance in this part of our business, as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers.  We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 4% in constant currency. 
In China, we grew through innovation and exports and the recovery continued from 2014 challenges, with lower demand from major quick service restaurants. Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $42 million, well ahead of $36 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
In constant currency, the gross -- the growth was even more impressive at 24%, with the benefit of higher sales in our CCI program, more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.
Let's turn to Slide 31. Across both segments, adjusted operating income was $123 million, a 1% increase from $122 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 7%.
This is an improvement from the first quarter as increased cost reductions and additional pricing actions are providing a greater offset to material cost inflation.
These same positive factors are impacting gross profit margin. While we were down 50 basis points year-on-year in the second quarter, this was a better performance than the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we expect our cost reduction and pricing activity to continue to improve gross profit margin.
However, we now expect gross profit margin for the fiscal year to be comparable to 2014 rather than up slightly.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 60 basis points, even with the impact of transaction costs related to our 2015 acquisition activity. 
Special charges of $19 million and that second quarter related primarily to the additional actions plant in EMEA that we announced in April. Below the operating income line, our effective tax rate was 16%, which was below our initial guidance and year-ago quarter due to a $13 million of discrete tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2015. Based on our current outlook, including these benefits and our projected mix of our business across tax jurisdictions, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is approximately 27% compared to our prior guidance of 27% to 28%.
This is based on underlying rate of approximately 29%. Keep in mind that in the absence of any further discrete items, we expect an unfavorable variance in the next 2 quarters, with the tax rate of 29% versus 21.4% in the third quarter of 2014, and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 19%, led by our joint venture in Mexico, which is -- continues to have a strong financial performance, as Lawrence described. This increase is net of an unfavorable currency impact. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.75. As you can see on Slide 34, this was an $0.11 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate, along with increases in our adjusted operating income, unconsolidated income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 35. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $186 million compared to $182 million in the first half of 2014. 
During the first half of 2015, we used $70 million of cash to acquire nearly 1 million shares of McCormick's stock, occurring mostly in the first quarter. Given our activity to date, we continue to anticipate a 1% reduction in the shares in 2015.
At quarter end, we had $46 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. The board approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization in March.
During the second quarter, we used a combination of cash and short-term borrowings to acquire Brand Aromatics for $63 million, and make the initial payment of $49 million to acquire Drogheria & Alimentari. Likewise, we expect to use a combination of cash and short-term borrowings for the acquisitions of Stubb's later this quarter.
Consistent with past practice, we have the curtailed our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt -- to adjusted EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. 
Our balance sheet remains sound. We're generating some cash flow, and we believe we're well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for the fiscal year 2015. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. The 3 acquisitions we have announced should add, at least, 1% of growth this year, giving us greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our range. We continue to estimate the currency would reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015.
We reaffirm our expected 6% to 7% constant currency growth for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 [ph] million in adjusted operating income. 
We continue to anticipate unfavorable currency rates to reduce operating income growth by 3 percentage points. For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 4% to 5% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $54 million estimated impact from special charges.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.47 to $3.54. This is a $0.03 increase from the previous guidance, reflecting the latest tax rate estimate. This new range, excluding an estimated $0.12 [ph] headwind from currency, is an increase of 7% to 9% from $3.37 [ph] in 2014.
On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.25 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. This range assumes a $0.29 impact from special charges.
As you consider the financial projection for the second half versus the year-ago period, keep in mind the projected headwinds from a higher tax rate, unfavorable currency and our plans to increase brand marketing. These factors are expected to cause a double-digit decline in third quarter adjusted earnings per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014.
However, our projection is to increase fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our acquisition activity, some debt paydown and future share repurchase activity.
Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And as we've gone through 2014 and we've developed a greater understanding of pricing dynamics, we came to realize that the price gaps, actually matter less than the absolute price points on about a dozen key items. So our initiatives this year has been focused more on managing the absolute price points on those key items. And it does not involve additional pricing action or promotional activity on our part. It's really the way we allocate the promotional spending that we're overdoing with the customers, to direct it to the most productive place.

So that one fits very well for us, and we see some other opportunities like that don't -- that don't impact or overlap with our critical customers. So we are -- we've expanded our horizons in terms of the kinds of acquisitions that we are considering. And I'll have Lawrence talk about China industrial."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies and continued the momentum that we established in the first quarter. While sale",379,"Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies and continued the momentum that we established in the first quarter. While sales declined 1%, in constant currency, we achieved a 5% year-on-year increase. We achieved higher constant-currency sales in both our business segments and across geographic regions, a very good performance from our business leaders and employees throughout McCormick.
Based on this broad-based growth and our outlook for the second half of 2015, we reaffirm our projection for 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth for the fiscal year. In fact, this year's pace of acquisition activity gives us more confidence at the upper end of the range. Special charges, along with currency, lowered our operating income result. However, we grew adjusted operating income in constant currency by 7%. This is an improvement from the first quarter when adjusted operating income in constant currency rose 1% .As we anticipated, profit growth is improving as our cost savings build and as additional pricing actions go into effect. This improvement supports our reaffirmed outlook for 6% to 7% adjusted operating income growth in 2015 on a constant-currency basis.
With a very favorable tax rate variance, second quarter earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share this period was $0.65 and excluding special charges, grew to $0.75 from $0.64 in the year-ago period. In addition to the favorable tax rate, other positive factors included the increase in adjusted operating income, further growth from our joint venture in Mexico and lower shares outstanding. This EPS result includes the impact of unfavorable currency. We've raised our latest earnings per share guidance to reflect the net impact of the favorable tax rate in the second quarter and our estimated tax rate for the second half. Aside from this tax adjustment, we feel just as confident in our base business EPS outlook.
Cash flow from our operations remained strong in $186 million, supporting our dividend program, along with business growth strategies, including acquisitions. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for focusing on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success.
Next, Lawrence is going to provide an update on each of our 2 business segments. Lawrence?"

As Alan indicated, we delivered constant-currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses, with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. Let's start with the consume",1658,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan indicated, we delivered constant-currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses, with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. 
Let's start with the consumer business. Across our entire consumer business, although we reported a sales decline of 3%, in constant currency, we achieved a 3% increase. I'll comment first on the strong results in certain international markets, then turn to the U.S. market for more detailed remarks.
China led our consumer business sales growth again this quarter, with a double-digit increase in constant currency. We had strong demand for McCormick brand herbs and spices, condiments and Seasoning Blends, driven by our brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also grew sales with the introduction of our McCormick brand product into central China, part of the sales synergies from our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments acquisition.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, economic and retail conditions remained challenging in parts of the region. However, in constant currency, we had strong volume-driven sales growth this period, particularly in France, Poland and Russia. 
In France, we're benefiting from our brand marketing and have expanded Ducros brand sales with a discount retailer. Distribution gains are also a primary sales growth driver for our business in Poland and Russia. And in Australia, consumer sales in constant currency rose at a double-digit rate this period from new distribution and product innovation.  
Before moving to the Americas, let's take a look at our lineup of new products for the second half in our EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions on Slide 7. One of our global initiatives is grilling. In EMEA, we are building out our barbecue products in the U.K., France, Poland and other markets with dry seasonings, wet marinades and sauces. And in France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, recognizing the popularity of burgers, we are introducing restaurant-quality burger seasonings in wet and dry sachets. 
Our Aeroplane gelatin in Australia is an iconic brand with 90% category share, and we are continuing to grow sales with new flavor varieties. Also in this market, we will be leveraging the authenticity of our Keene’s brand into curry recipe bases. 
Let's turn to the Americas. In this region, we're making further progress improving the performance of our U.S. consumer business. Consumer interest in flavor, simple and healthy ingredients and cooking with fresh product continues to drive strong category growth for spices and seasoning as seen in the latest consumption data, with category sales up 5% in the quarter. This same data shows that sales of our McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 1%. This is an improvement compared to 1% decline in the past 52 weeks. We are definitely heading in the right direction.
For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we continue to gain share. In this latest quarter, the increase of 50 basis points marked the 20th consecutive month of share gain. We're achieving this through innovation as well as effective marketing for both new products and core items. Within the subsegment of taco seasoning mixes, we increased share of our McCormick brand 3 percentage points in the last 52 weeks, and our share of chili seasoning mixes is up 4 percentage points. 
We grew share of Zatarain's 5% this quarter versus the year-ago period. Zatarain's rice mixes are outpacing the category growth rate, and consumption of our frozen entrées rose 4%. Across all of our U.S. brands, we are driving growth through accelerating innovation, building brand equity and through our category leadership at retail.
On the innovation front, I'll comment on 2 of our recent launches. I'm pleased to report that in less than 1 year, our McCormick Skillet Sauces have exceeded 10% share in this growing category, driven by the retail placement we have gained and our marketing support. The relaunch of our Gourmet line began early in 2015 with greater variety of flavor-sealed technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has a more premium, fresh appearance.
In this subsegment of the spice and seasoning category, nearly 80% of retail distribution points are now converted to the new packaging, and we've seen base consumption trends for McCormick Gourmet strengthen, with consumption up 4% in the second quarter. This gourmet initiative has also helped us expand the number of McCormick brand SKUs on the shelves with existing customers, gain distribution with new customers and at other customers, reduce the number of competitive brands they carry. 
For the second half of 2015, we are excited about our innovation plans. These include extending our liquid recipe mixes platform with the introduction of slow cooker sauces. Flavors include smoky barbecue pulled pork and pot roast with caramelized onion and cracked black pepper. We will introduce additional gluten-free recipe mixes, including beef stew and fajita, to build off the success of our initial varieties and Kitchen Basics stock cubes, the convenient way to boost flavor for soups, stews and risottos with no MSG or artificial flavors, including a vegetarian variety. Also in the Americas region, our launch plans in Canada include additional Skillet Sauces, gluten-free recipe mixes and reduced sodium items. And in Latin America, we are introducing mustard flavors and barbecue sauces. 
A second growth initiative in the U.S. is building brand equity. We had particular success this quarter with our Grill Mates campaign, including excellent in-store display execution, great new television advertising and a 2015 grilling flavor forecast. Second quarter sales of Grill Mates grew 9%, and we expect to maintain this momentum through the peak grilling season.
Through digital marketing, we're connecting directly with consumers. We're moving up the list of go-to places for online recipe. mccormick.com is now in the top 40 recipe destinations, up from 175th in 2012, with 30 million annual visitors and 40 million recipe views. We have the largest online grilling community and are connecting with passionate users of OLD BAY, Zatarain's and other distinctive brands. And behind the scenes, we have better alignment of our digital assets, not only in the U.S. but all around the world. 
We continue to strengthen our retail partnership to drive category growth and engage consumers. On the last call, Alan discussed a sharper focus on our retail price points and advanced analytic rigor around category management. As we roll this out, several retailers have begun to partner with us on shelf price adjustments, and we're very encouraged by the results for them and for McCormick. At the end of the third quarter, we will be ready to launch a new comprehensive category management tool, supported by additional internal resources, and we expect these capabilities to accelerate our progress as it relates to pricing optimization.
As you would expect, this is an account-by-account discussion. As the latest consumption data illustrated, we have reduced the category share decline for our brand, but we're not yet where we want to be. I believe we have the right actions and the right team in place to stabilize and then grow our share. In tandem with these actions, we are driving growth for our recipe mixes as well as niche brands within our U.S. portfolio, such as Lawry's, OLD BAY, Grill Mates, Zatarain's, Thai Kitchen, and now, Drogheria & Alimentari. 
Before I move to our industrial business, I just want to recognize the great performance of our joint venture in Mexico. Despite an unfavorable currency rate, net income for this business rose 36%, mainly due to sales growth and favorable costs. 
Turning now to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and in constant currency, a very strong 7%. This higher sales and our cost-reduction initiatives led to a double-digit increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency. EMEA led the growth this period, with a double-digit constant-currency sales increase and volume and product mix up 9%. This part of our business has had exceptional sales growth for the past 3 years, as seen on Slide 11. 
Whereas our business with quick service restaurants has been a challenge in other regions during this period, we are winning in EMEA with product innovation,  and for the third year in a row, we're named new product supplier of the year in this region by a leading quick service restaurant customer. We also increased our share of business with quick service restaurants and are supporting the geographic expansion of those customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with food manufacturers we supply, and as an example, have broken ground on a new facility in the Middle East. 
In the Americas region, we're benefiting from an increase in consumer snacking, developing seasonings for snack bars, crackers, chips and similar product. At the same time, our customers are moving toward more simple ingredients, and our foundation in spices and herbs has us well positioned. In the second quarter, we had particularly strong demand from these customers in Latin America, with double-digit sales growth in constant currency. We have a strong base in Mexico and are supporting customer expansion into South America. In Brazil, we cut the ribbon on a small R&D center this quarter to build our expertise in the local flavors. 
We also grew year-on-year sales to food manufacturers in the U.S. this period and had a solid performance with sales of branded food service product. In addition, we had the benefit of sales from Brand Aromatics, acquired early in March. Offsetting a portion of these gains was further weakness in our U.S. sales to quick service restaurants. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, we're pleased to be seeing further recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants. As in the first quarter, we had an added benefit of innovation and limited-time offers and with export sales of products supplied by our facilities in China. Our outlook is for continued improvement through the second half of 2015 for our industrial business in China.
Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back over to Alan."

As Lawrence reported, we're driving solid performance across many parts of our business, demonstrating the effectiveness of our growth strategies and our strong execution. We're making steady progress with our initiatives and encouraged by 2015 results through the first half. 
Next, I would like to provide a few updates from the time of our first quarter earnings call back in late March, starting with acquisition activity. McCormick's business development team is having a busy year with great results. Back in February, we announced an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari and completed this purchase at the end of May. In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics. And about a week ago, we signed an agreement to acquire One World Foods, seller of Stubb's, the #1 brand of premium, authentic barbecue sauce in the U.S. Stubb's products also include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Annual sales of this business are approximately $30 million and are growing at a double-digit rate.
Stubb's is a perfect complement to our products, rounding out our range of grilling items under the Grill Mates, Lawry's and McCormick brands. To maintain the authenticity of this brand, we plan to keep the business headquarters in Austin, Texas. We expect to maintain a double-digit pace of sales growth near term through expanded distribution, increased household penetration and innovative flavors. We anticipate significant cost synergies that will deliver at least $10 million of incremental EBITDA by 2017. At an anticipated purchase price of $100 million, we expect Stubb's to be another attractive deal for McCormick.
Along with our efforts to build sales through acquisitions and the innovation and brand marketing activity that Lawrence discussed, employees throughout the company are making great progress with our efforts to eliminate costs. We reaffirm our goal to achieve at least $85 million in cost savings this year. This will bring our cumulative annual cost savings to more than $400 million since our 2009 launch of McCormick's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI. 
During the second quarter, we announced additional reorganization plans in the EMEA region. These plans include the transfer of certain additional activities to the recently established McCormick shared services center in Poland. While we expect to record charges of approximately $25 million related to these actions, there's a very good payback, with estimated annual cost savings of $16 million by the end of 2017. We've recently increased our resources to drive our CCI program and expect to continue our track record of productivity improvement throughout the organization.
Let's turn to some recent leadership changes. As announced in early June, we're pleased to have Maritza Montiel and Michael Conway joining our board. Maritza is former deputy CEO and Vice Chairman of Deloitte. During her 40 years with the firm, she led a variety of strategic initiatives prior to retiring in mid-2014. Michael is President of Global Channel Development for Starbucks. He has responsibility for all commercial and business strategy functions and is driving aggressive plans to expand to emerging international markets. Prior to Starbucks, Michael served in leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup. Retiring from our board is J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO of Hershey. He served as a Director since 2005, and we truly appreciate his participation and contributions to our success.
Turning to our company leaders. Cile Perich, Senior VP of Human Resources, retired from McCormick after 32 years of exemplary service and 7 years as a member of our management committee. On Slide 17, we've listed the current members of the management committee, which now include Lisa Manzone, who is promoted to Cile's role; and also, Brendan Foley, who joined us from Heinz about a year ago and whose responsibilities have been broadened from Head of U.S. Consumer Business to a North American role. We also announced in April that Nneka Rimmer has joined the company. Most recently with Boston Consulting Group, Nneka is responsible for shaping overall corporate strategies and working to increase EVA at McCormick. I'm confident that these latest changes will provide strong leadership for our business going forward.
The last topic I want to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to the healthfulness of spices and herbs. Since its formation in 2007, the McCormick Science Institute, MSI, has supported scientific research and dissemination of information on the health benefits of culinary herbs and spices. In 2014, MSI, in partnership with the American Society for Nutrition, hosted a summit of researchers, government officials and health and wellness communicators to discuss the role of herbs and spices in a healthy diet. This message is beginning to resonate. In May, we were pleased to learn that the U.S. dietary guidelines advisory committee has recommended to the government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encourage uses of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. We're optimistic that this change will be made.
In addition, Australia's healthy eating pyramid was recently updated and now encourages people to enjoy herbs and spices to flavor food without using salt. We regard our categories as advantaged, on trend with spicy foods, fresh foods, ethnic cuisine, simple ingredient. This latest health news is just one more reason for consumers to turn to spices and herbs to add flavor. 
It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon for a financial perspective on our results and guidance."

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments and in both developed and emerging markets. On a constant-currency basis, the unde",1616,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments and in both developed and emerging markets. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 5%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and rose 1%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved 7% growth, a sequential improvement from the first quarter result.
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew second quarter consumer business sales 3% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2014, with contributions from higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions mainly related to honey products in Canada. As Lawrence described, we grew U.S. sales of recipe mixes, Grill Mates and Zatarain's products. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America grew at a double-digit rate this period as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant currency grew 4% as a result of higher volume and product mix. Distribution gains were a major reason for the increase, with wins in France, Poland and Russia. Our brand marketing and innovation are additional factors driving sales, and we look forward to including sales of Drogheria & Alimentari in our results starting in the third quarter.
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 7%, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. Our sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate year-on-year. And Australia also delivered a double-digit increase for the second quarter. We had some further pressure from basmati rice prices in India, leading to lower pricing for the region this period.
In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $81 million compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs, retirement benefit expense and product mix. Also in the second quarter, we recorded about $1 million of transaction costs related to the acquisitions we have announced in 2015.
Turning to our industrial business. We grew second quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix each added 3 percentage points and acquisitions another 1 percentage point of growth. 
In the Americas region, sales rose 5% in constant currency, mainly from pricing actions and the addition of Brand Aromatics. Volume and product mix were comparable to the year-ago period as increased sales of snack seasonings, particularly in Latin America, and higher sales of branded food service products were offset by continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 12% in constant currency, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. As Lawrence described, we are in our third year of exceptional performance in this part of our business as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers.  
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 4% in constant currency. In China, we grew through innovation and export, and the recovery continued from 2014 challenges, with lower demand from major quick service restaurants. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $42 million, well ahead of $36 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the gross -- the growth was even more impressive at 24%, with the benefit of higher sales in our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.
Let's turn to Slide 31. Across both segments, adjusted operating income was $123 million, a 1% increase from $122 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 7%.
This is an improvement from the first quarter as increased cost reductions and additional pricing actions are providing a greater offset to material cost inflation.
These same positive factors are impacting gross profit margin. While we were down 50 basis points year-on-year in the second quarter, this was a better performance than the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we expect our cost reduction and pricing activity to continue to improve gross profit margin. However, we now expect gross profit margin for the fiscal year to be comparable to 2014 rather than up slightly.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 60 basis points even with the impact of transaction costs related to our 2015 acquisition activity. Special charges of $19 million in the second quarter related primarily to the additional actions planned in EMEA that we announced in April. 
Below the operating income line, our effective tax rate was 16%, which was below our initial guidance and year-ago quarter due to  $13 million of discrete tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2015. Based on our current outlook, including these benefits and our projected mix of our business across tax jurisdictions, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is approximately 27% compared to our prior guidance of 27% to 28%. This is based on an underlying rate of approximately 29%. 
Keep in mind that in the absence of any further discrete items, we expect an unfavorable variance in the next 2 quarters, with a tax rate of 29% versus 21.4% in the third quarter of 2014 and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 19%, led by our joint venture in Mexico, which continues to have a strong financial performance, as Lawrence described. This increase is net of an unfavorable currency impact. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.75. As you can see on Slide 34, this was an $0.11 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate, along with increases in our adjusted operating income, unconsolidated income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 35. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $186 million compared to $182 million in the first half of 2014.  During the first half of 2015, we used $70 million of cash to acquire nearly 1 million shares of McCormick's stock, occurring mostly in the first quarter. Given our activity to date, we continue to anticipate a 1% reduction in the shares in 2015. At quarter end, we had $46 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. The board approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization in March.
During the second quarter, we used a combination of cash and short-term borrowings to acquire Brand Aromatics for $63 million and make the initial payment of $49 million to acquire Drogheria & Alimentari. Likewise, we expect to use a combination of cash and short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Stubb's later this quarter. 
Consistent with past practice, we have the curtailed our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. The 3 acquisitions we have announced should add at least 1% of growth this year, giving us greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our range. We continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015.
We reaffirm our expected 6% to 7% constant currency growth for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million in adjusted operating income. We continue to anticipate unfavorable currency rates to reduce operating income growth by 3 percentage points. For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 4% to 5% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $54 million estimated impact from special charges.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.47 to $3.54. This is a $0.03 increase from the previous guidance, reflecting the latest tax rate estimate. This new range, excluding an estimated $0.12 headwind from currency, is an increase of 7% to 9% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.25 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. This range assumes a $0.29 impact from special charges.
As you consider the financial projection for the second half versus the year-ago period, keep in mind the projected headwinds from a higher tax rate, unfavorable currency and our plans to increase brand marketing. These factors are expected to cause a double-digit decline in third quarter adjusted earnings per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. However, our projection is to increase fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our acquisition activity, some debt paydown and future share repurchase activity.

The big difference, I think, in our business in China for our consumer segment is that we're a lot less dependent on the modern trade than many of our peer companies. With the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments, we've got a strong foothold in the central part of China, a great penetration in the more traditional segment of the market, and we're experiencing really broad-based growth on both our McCormick brand and on our acquired brands across China. We recognize that there's been some slowdown in economic growth in China, but our categories continue to do well, and our brands, in particular, had really broad-based growth in this quarter.

So when we spoke about this at CAGNY in 2014, our focus was on price gaps versus private label and versus key competitors and having conversations with retailers about those price gaps with the aim of narrowing them, either by reducing the prices on McCormick or frankly, by raising the prices on competitive items that were irrationally priced, in some cases below the retailers' private label. And as we've gone through 2014 and we've developed greater understanding of pricing dynamics, we came to realize that the price gaps actually mattered less than the absolute price points on about a dozen key items. So our initiatives this year had been focused more on managing the absolute price points on those key items, and it does not involve additional pricing action or promotional activity on our part. It's really the way we allocate the promotional spending that we're already doing with the customers, to direct it to the most productive place. And then finally, I think in my prepared remarks, I mentioned a comprehensive category management tool, and this is really the next step in our evolution on this, to have an even stronger analytic capability that allows us to understand and model the cost elasticities of the entire category to optimize it for the retailer."

On China industrial, those limited-time offers that helped you in the first quarter, did those roll off in the second as you had expected?

The company has gotten more aggressive with M&A this year, 3 deals, and the latest one's Stubb's in barbecue. I think the company's challenge in M&A has been potentially some kind of conflict with industrial customers who may be in the same business. Are you concerned about all the -- any of that? Or is there still enough runway based on the M&A you see to not have any conflicts arise within your industrial customers?"

We always analyze for deals what the competitive overlap is going to be. We know that we need to be in parts of the categories that are growing faster, and we see opportunities for this in this case, in the case of barbecue sauces. We saw very little competitive overlap, and we saw the opportunity for us to really participate in more of the premium and higher price part of the category that's growing. And so it's a brand that has no high fructose corn syrup and has carved out a very nice -- free from all the stuff that consumers don't seem to want right now.

McCormick's second quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies and continued the momentum that we established in the first quarter. While sales declined 1%, in constant currency, we achieved a 5% year-on-year increase. We achieved higher constant-currency sales in both our business segments and across geographic regions, a very good performance from our business leaders and employees throughout McCormick.
Based on this broad-based growth and our outlook for the second half of 2015, we reaffirm our projection for 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth for the fiscal year. In fact, this year's pace of acquisition activity gives us more confidence at the upper end of the range. Special charges, along with currency, lowered our operating income result. However, we grew adjusted operating income in constant currency by 7%. This is an improvement from the first quarter when adjusted operating income in constant currency rose 1% .As we anticipated, profit growth is improving as our cost savings build and as additional pricing actions go into effect. This improvement supports our reaffirmed outlook for 6% to 7% adjusted operating income growth in 2015 on a constant-currency basis.
With a very favorable tax rate variance, second quarter earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share this period was $0.65 and excluding special charges, grew to $0.75 from $0.64 in the year-ago period. In addition to the favorable tax rate, other positive factors included the increase in adjusted operating income, further growth from our joint venture in Mexico and lower shares outstanding. This EPS result includes the impact of unfavorable currency. We've raised our latest earnings per share guidance to reflect the net impact of the favorable tax rate in the second quarter and our estimated tax rate for the second half. Aside from this tax adjustment, we feel just as confident in our base business EPS outlook.
Cash flow from our operations remained strong in $186 million, supporting our dividend program, along with business growth strategies, including acquisitions. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for focusing on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success.
Next, Lawrence is going to provide an update on each of our 2 business segments. Lawrence?"

Let's start with the consume",1658,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan indicated, we delivered constant-currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses, with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. 
Let's start with the consumer business. Across our entire consumer business, although we reported a sales decline of 3%, in constant currency, we achieved a 3% increase. I'll comment first on the strong results in certain international markets, then turn to the U.S. market for more detailed remarks.
China led our consumer business sales growth again this quarter, with a double-digit increase in constant currency. We had strong demand for McCormick brand herbs and spices, condiments and Seasoning Blends, driven by our brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also grew sales with the introduction of our McCormick brand products into central China, part of the sales synergies from our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments acquisition.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, economic and retail conditions remained challenging in parts of the region. However, in constant currency, we had strong volume-driven sales growth this period, particularly in France, Poland and Russia. 
In France, we're benefiting from our brand marketing and have expanded Ducros brand sales with a discount retailer. Distribution gains are also a primary sales growth driver for our business in Poland and Russia. And in Australia, consumer sales in constant currency rose at a double-digit rate this period from new distribution and product innovation.  
Before moving to the Americas, let's take a look at our lineup of new products for the second half in our EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions on Slide 7. One of our global initiatives is grilling. In EMEA, we are building out our barbecue products in the U.K., France, Poland and other markets with dry seasonings, wet marinades and sauces. And in France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, recognizing the popularity of burgers, we are introducing restaurant-quality burger seasonings in wet and dry sachets. 
Our Aeroplane gelatin in Australia is an iconic brand with 90% category share, and we are continuing to grow sales with new flavor varieties. Also in this market, we will be leveraging the authenticity of our Keene’s brand into curry recipe bases. 
Let's turn to the Americas. In this region, we're making further progress improving the performance of our U.S. consumer business. Consumer interest in flavor, simple and healthy ingredients and cooking with fresh product continues to drive strong category growth for spices and seasoning as seen in the latest consumption data, with category sales up 5% in the quarter. This same data shows that sales of our McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 1%. This is an improvement compared to 1% decline in the past 52 weeks. We are definitely heading in the right direction.
For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we continue to gain share. In this latest quarter, the increase of 50 basis points marked the 20th consecutive month of share gain. We're achieving this through innovation as well as effective marketing for both new products and core items. Within the subsegment of taco seasoning mixes, we increased share of our McCormick brand 3 percentage points in the last 52 weeks, and our share of chili seasoning mixes is up 4 percentage points. 
We grew share of Zatarain's 5% this quarter versus the year-ago period. Zatarain's rice mixes are outpacing the category growth rate, and consumption of our frozen entrées rose 4%. Across all of our U.S. brands, we are driving growth through accelerating innovation, building brand equity and through our category leadership at retail.
On the innovation front, I'll comment on 2 of our recent launches. I'm pleased to report that in less than 1 year, our McCormick Skillet Sauces have exceeded 10% share in this growing category, driven by the retail placement we have gained and our marketing support. The relaunch of our Gourmet line began early in 2015 with greater variety of flavor-sealed technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has a more premium, fresh appearance.
In this subsegment of the spice and seasoning category, nearly 80% of retail distribution points are now converted to the new packaging, and we've seen base consumption trends for McCormick Gourmet strengthen, with consumption up 4% in the second quarter. This gourmet initiative has also helped us expand the number of McCormick brand SKUs on the shelves with existing customers, gain distribution with new customers and at other customers, reduce the number of competitive brands they carry. 
For the second half of 2015, we are excited about our innovation plans. These include extending our liquid recipe mixes platform with the introduction of slow cooker sauces. Flavors include smoky barbecue pulled pork and pot roast with caramelized onion and cracked black pepper. We will introduce additional gluten-free recipe mixes, including beef stew and fajita, to build off the success of our initial varieties and Kitchen Basics stock cubes, the convenient way to boost flavor for soups, stews and risotos with no MSG or artificial flavors, including a vegetarian variety. Also in the Americas region, our launch plans in Canada include additional Skillet Sauces, gluten-free recipe mixes and reduced sodium items. And in Latin America, we are introducing mustard flavors and barbecue sauces. 
A second growth initiative in the U.S. is building brand equity. We had particular success this quarter with our Grill Mates campaign, including excellent in-store display execution, great new television advertising and a 2015 grilling flavor forecast. Second quarter sales of Grill Mates grew 9%, and we expect to maintain this momentum through the peak grilling season.
Through digital marketing, we're connecting directly with consumers. We're moving up the list of go-to places for online recipe. mccormick.com is now in the top 40 recipe destinations, up from 175th in 2012, with 30 million annual visitors and 40 million recipe views. We have the largest online grilling community and are connecting with passionate users of OLD BAY, Zatarain's and other distinctive brands. And behind the scenes, we have better alignment of our digital assets, not only in the U.S. but all around the world. 
We continue to strengthen our retail partnership to drive category growth and engage consumers. On the last call, Alan discussed a sharper focus on our retail price points and advanced analytic rigor around category management. As we roll this out, several retailers have begun to partner with us on shelf price adjustments, and we're very encouraged by the results for them and for McCormick. By the end of the third quarter, we will be ready to launch a new comprehensive category management tool, supported by additional internal resources, and we expect these capabilities to accelerate our progress as it relates to pricing optimization.
As you would expect, this is an account-by-account discussion. As the latest consumption data illustrated, we have reduced the category share decline for our brand, but we're not yet where we want to be. I believe we have the right actions and the right team in place to stabilize and then grow our share. In tandem with these actions, we are driving growth for our recipe mixes as well as niche brands within our U.S. portfolio, such as Lawry's, OLD BAY, Grill Mates, Zatarain's, Thai Kitchen, and now, Drogheria & Alimentari. 
Before I move to our industrial business, I just want to recognize the great performance of our joint venture in Mexico. Despite an unfavorable currency rate, net income for this business rose 36%, mainly due to sales growth and favorable costs. 
Turning now to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and in constant currency, a very strong 7%. These higher sales and our cost-reduction initiatives led to a double-digit increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency. EMEA led the growth this period, with a double-digit constant-currency sales increase and volume and product mix up 9%. This part of our business has had exceptional sales growth for the past 3 years, as seen on Slide 11. 
Whereas our business with quick service restaurants has been a challenge in other regions during this period, we are winning in EMEA with product innovation,  and for the third year in a row, were named new product supplier of the year in this region by a leading quick service restaurant customer. We also increased our share of business with quick service restaurants and are supporting the geographic expansion of those customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with food manufacturers we supply, and as an example, have broken ground on a new facility in the Middle East. 
In the Americas region, we're benefiting from an increase in consumer snacking, developing seasonings for snack bars, crackers, chips and similar product. At the same time, our customers are moving toward more simple ingredients, and our foundation in spices and herbs has us well positioned. In the second quarter, we had particularly strong demand from these customers in Latin America, with double-digit sales growth in constant currency. We have a strong base in Mexico and are supporting customer expansion into South America. In Brazil, we cut the ribbon on a small R&D center this quarter to build our expertise in the local flavors. 
We also grew year-on-year sales to food manufacturers in the U.S. this period and had a solid performance with sales of branded food service product. In addition, we had the benefit of sales from Brand Aromatics, acquired early in March. Offsetting a portion of these gains was further weakness in our U.S. sales to quick service restaurants. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, we're pleased to be seeing further recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants. As in the first quarter, we had an added benefit of innovation and limited-time offers and with export sales of products supplied by our facilities in China. Our outlook is for continued improvement through the second half of 2015 for our industrial business in China.
Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back over to Alan."

As Lawrence reported, we're driving solid performance across many parts of our business, demonstrating the effectiveness of our growth strategies and our strong execution. We're making steady progress with our initiatives and encouraged by 2015 results through the first half. 
Next, I would like to provide a few updates from the time of our first quarter earnings call back in late March, starting with acquisition activity. McCormick's business development team is having a busy year with great results. Back in February, we announced an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari and completed this purchase at the end of May. In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics. And about a week ago, we signed an agreement to acquire One World Foods, seller of Stubb's, the #1 brand of premium, authentic barbecue sauce in the U.S. Stubb's products also include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Annual sales of this business are approximately $30 million and are growing at a double-digit rate.
Stubb's is a perfect complement to our products, rounding out our range of grilling items under the Grill Mates, Lawry's and McCormick brands. To maintain the authenticity of this brand, we plan to keep the business headquarters in Austin, Texas. We expect to maintain a double-digit pace of sales growth near term through expanded distribution, increased household penetration and innovative flavors. We anticipate significant cost synergies that will deliver at least $10 million of incremental EBITDA by 2017. At an anticipated purchase price of $100 million, we expect Stubb's to be another attractive deal for McCormick.
Along with our efforts to build sales through acquisitions and the innovation and brand marketing activity that Lawrence discussed, employees throughout the company are making great progress with our efforts to eliminate costs. We reaffirm our goal to achieve at least $85 million in cost savings this year. This will bring our cumulative annual cost savings to more than $400 million since our 2009 launch of McCormick's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI. 
During the second quarter, we announced additional reorganization plans in the EMEA region. These plans include the transfer of certain additional activities to the recently established McCormick shared services center in Poland. While we expect to record charges of approximately $25 million related to these actions, there's a very good payback, with estimated annual cost savings of $16 million by the end of 2017.
We've recently increased our resources to drive our CCI program and expect to continue our track record of productivity improvement throughout the organization.
Let's turn to some recent leadership changes. As announced in early June, we're pleased to have Maritza Montiel and Michael Conway joining our board. Maritza is former deputy CEO and Vice Chairman of Deloitte. During her 40 years with the firm, she led a variety of strategic initiatives prior to retiring in mid-2014. Michael is President of Global Channel Development for Starbucks. He has responsibility for all commercial and business strategy functions and is driving aggressive plans to expand to emerging international markets. Prior to Starbucks, Michael served in leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup. Retiring from our board is J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO of Hershey. He served as a Director since 2005, and we truly appreciate his participation and contributions to our success.
Turning to our company leaders. Cile Perich, Senior VP of Human Resources, retired from McCormick after 32 years of exemplary service and 7 years as a member of our management committee. On Slide 17, we've listed the current members of the management committee, which now include Lisa Manzone, who is promoted to Cile's role; and also, Brendan Foley, who joined us from Heinz about a year ago and whose responsibilities have been broadened from Head of U.S. Consumer Business to a North American role. We also announced in April that Nneka Rimmer has joined the company. Most recently with Boston Consulting Group, Nneka is responsible for shaping overall corporate strategies and working to increase EVA at McCormick. I'm confident that these latest changes will provide strong leadership for our business going forward.
The last topic I want to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to the healthfulness of spices and herbs. Since its formation in 2007, the McCormick Science Institute, MSI, has supported scientific research and dissemination of information on the health benefits of culinary herbs and spices. In 2014, MSI, in partnership with the American Society for Nutrition, hosted a summit of researchers, government officials and health and wellness communicators to discuss the role of herbs and spices in a healthy diet. This message is beginning to resonate. In May, we were pleased to learn that the U.S. dietary guidelines advisory committee has recommended to the government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encourage uses of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. We're optimistic that this change will be made.
In addition, Australia's healthy eating pyramid was recently updated and now encourages people to enjoy herbs and spices to flavor food without using salt. We regard our categories as advantaged, on trend with spicy foods, fresh foods, ethnic cuisine, simple ingredient. This latest health news is just one more reason for consumers to turn to spices and herbs to add flavor. 
It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon for a financial perspective on our results and guidance."

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments and in both developed and emerging markets.

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments and in both developed and emerging markets. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 5%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and rose 1%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved 7% growth, a sequential improvement from the first quarter result.
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew second quarter consumer business sales 3% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2014, with contributions from higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions mainly related to honey products in Canada. As Lawrence described, we grew U.S. sales of recipe mixes, Grill Mates and Zatarain's products. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America grew at a double-digit rate this period as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant currency grew 4% as a result of higher volume and product mix. Distribution gains were a major reason for the increase, with wins in France, Poland and Russia. Our brand marketing and innovation are additional factors driving sales, and we look forward to including sales of Drogheria & Alimentari in our results starting in the third quarter.
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 7%, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. Our sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate year-on-year. And Australia also delivered a double-digit increase for the second quarter. We had some further pressure from basmati rice prices in India, leading to lower pricing for the region this period.
In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $81 million compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs, retirement benefit expense and product mix. Also in the second quarter, we recorded about $1 million of transaction costs related to the acquisitions we have announced in 2015.
Turning to our industrial business. We grew second quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix each added 3 percentage points and acquisitions another 1 percentage point of growth. 
In the Americas region, sales rose 5% in constant currency, mainly from pricing actions and the addition of Brand Aromatics. Volume and product mix were comparable to the year-ago period as increased sales of snack seasonings, particularly in Latin America, and higher sales of branded food service products were offset by continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 12% in constant currency, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. As Lawrence described, we are in our third year of exceptional performance in this part of our business as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers.  
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 4% in constant currency. In China, we grew through innovation and export, and the recovery continued from 2014 challenges, with lower demand from major quick service restaurants. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $42 million, well ahead of $36 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the gross -- the growth was even more impressive at 24%, with the benefit of higher sales in our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.
Let's turn to Slide 31. Across both segments, adjusted operating income was $123 million, a 1% increase from $122 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 7%.
This is an improvement from the first quarter as increased cost reductions and additional pricing actions are providing a greater offset to material cost inflation.
These same positive factors are impacting gross profit margin. While we were down 50 basis points year-on-year in the second quarter, this was a better performance than the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we expect our cost reduction and pricing activity to continue to improve gross profit margin. However, we now expect gross profit margin for the fiscal year to be comparable to 2014 rather than up slightly.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 60 basis points even with the impact of transaction costs related to our 2015 acquisition activity. Special charges of $19 million in the second quarter related primarily to the additional actions planned in EMEA that we announced in April. 
Below the operating income line, our effective tax rate was 16%, which was below our initial guidance and year-ago quarter due to $13 million of discrete tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2015. Based on our current outlook, including these benefits and our projected mix of our business across tax jurisdictions, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is approximately 27% compared to our prior guidance of 27% to 28%. This is based on an underlying rate of approximately 29%. 
Keep in mind that in the absence of any further discrete items, we expect an unfavorable variance in the next 2 quarters, with a tax rate of 29% versus 21.4% in the third quarter of 2014 and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 19%, led by our joint venture in Mexico, which continues to have a strong financial performance, as Lawrence described. This increase is net of an unfavorable currency impact. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.75. As you can see on Slide 34, this was an $0.11 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate, along with increases in our adjusted operating income, unconsolidated income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 35. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $186 million compared to $182 million in the first half of 2014.  During the first half of 2015, we used $70 million of cash to acquire nearly 1 million shares of McCormick's stock, occurring mostly in the first quarter. Given our activity to date, we continue to anticipate a 1% reduction in the shares in 2015. At quarter end, we had $46 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. The board approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization in March.
During the second quarter, we used a combination of cash and short-term borrowings to acquire Brand Aromatics for $63 million and make the initial payment of $49 million to acquire Drogheria & Alimentari. Likewise, we expect to use a combination of cash and short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Stubb's later this quarter. 
Consistent with past practice, we have the curtailed our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. The 3 acquisitions we have announced should add at least 1% of growth this year, giving us greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our range. We continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015.
We reaffirm our expected 6% to 7% constant currency growth for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million in adjusted operating income. We continue to anticipate unfavorable currency rates to reduce operating income growth by 3 percentage points. For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 4% to 5% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $54 million estimated impact from special charges.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.47 to $3.54. This is a $0.03 increase from the previous guidance, reflecting the latest tax rate estimate. This new range, excluding an estimated $0.12 headwind from currency, is an increase of 7% to 9% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.25 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. This range assumes a $0.29 impact from special charges.
As you consider the financial projection for the second half versus the year-ago period, keep in mind the projected headwinds from a higher tax rate, unfavorable currency and our plans to increase brand marketing. These factors are expected to cause a double-digit decline in third quarter adjusted earnings per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. However, our projection is to increase fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our acquisition activity, some debt paydown and future share repurchase activity.

The big difference, I think, in our business in China for our consumer segment is that we're a lot less dependent on the modern trade than many of our peer companies. With the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments, we've got a strong foothold in the central part of China, a great penetration in the more traditional segment of the market, and we're experiencing really broad-based growth on both our McCormick brand and on our acquired brands across China.

So when we spoke about this at CAGNY in 2014, our focus was on price gaps versus private label and versus key competitors and having conversations with retailers about those price gaps with the aim of narrowing them, either by reducing the prices on McCormick or frankly, by raising the prices on competitive items that were irrationally priced, in some cases below the retailers' private label. And as we've gone through 2014 and we've developed greater understanding of pricing dynamics, we came to realize that the price gaps actually mattered less than the absolute price points on about a dozen key items. So our initiatives this year had been focused more on managing the absolute price points on those key items, and it does not involve additional pricing action or promotional activity on our part. It's really the way we allocate the promotional spending that we're already doing with the customers, to direct it to the most productive place.

We expect gross margin -- as we talked about the impact of raw material costs this year, we said it would hurt us earlier in the year. We're forecasting mid-single-digit material cost inflation. And the CCI program --  and that was hitting us right away at the beginning part of the year. The CCI was going to take some time for us to help offset that. So our expectation is, as we progress through the year, gross margin will have a sequential improvement, such that by year-end, we should start -- we should see gross margin improvement year-on-year. So we've got improvement in Q2 versus Q3. We anticipate further sequential -- I'm sorry, Q1 -- Q2 versus Q1. We expect further improvement in Q3 versus Q2 and then again improvement in the fourth quarter. So it's a function of the timing of raw material costs and the timing of our CCI."

We always analyze for deals what the competitive overlap is going to be. We know that we need to be in parts of the categories that are growing faster, and we see opportunities for this in this case. In the case of barbecue sauces, we saw very little competitive overlap, and we saw the opportunity for us to really participate in more of the premium and higher price part of the category that's growing. And so it's a brand that has no high fructose corn syrup and has carved out a very nice -- free from all the stuff that consumers don't seem to want right now.

While sale",379,"Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies and continued the momentum that we established in the first quarter. While sales declined 1%, in constant currency, we achieved a 5% year-on-year increase. We achieved higher constant-currency sales in both our business segments and across geographic regions, a very good performance from our business leaders and employees throughout McCormick.
Based on this broad-based growth and our outlook for the second half of 2015, we reaffirm our projection for 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth for the fiscal year. In fact, this year's pace of acquisition activity gives us more confidence at the upper end of the range. Special charges, along with currency, lowered our operating income result. However, we grew adjusted operating income in constant currency by 7%. This is an improvement from the first quarter when adjusted operating income in constant currency rose 1% .As we anticipated, profit growth is improving as our cost savings build and as additional pricing actions go into effect. This improvement supports our reaffirmed outlook for 6% to 7% adjusted operating income growth in 2015 on a constant-currency basis.
With a very favorable tax rate variance, second quarter earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share this period was $0.65 and excluding special charges, grew to $0.75 from $0.64 in the year-ago period. In addition to the favorable tax rate, other positive factors included the increase in adjusted operating income, further growth from our joint venture in Mexico and lower shares outstanding. This EPS result includes the impact of unfavorable currency. We've raised our latest earnings per share guidance to reflect the net impact of the favorable tax rate in the second quarter and our estimated tax rate for the second half. Aside from this tax adjustment, we feel just as confident in our base business EPS outlook.
Cash flow from our operations remained strong in $186 million, supporting our dividend program, along with business growth strategies, including acquisitions. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for focusing on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success.
Next, Lawrence is going to provide an update on each of our 2 business segments. Lawrence?"

As Alan indicated, we delivered constant-currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses, with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. 
Let's start with the consumer business. Across our entire consumer business, although we reported a sales decline of 3%, in constant currency, we achieved a 3% increase. I'll comment first on the strong results in certain international markets, then turn to the U.S. market for more detailed remarks.
China led our consumer business sales growth again this quarter, with a double-digit increase in constant currency. We had strong demand for McCormick brand herbs and spices, condiments and Seasoning Blends, driven by our brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also grew sales with the introduction of our McCormick brand products into central China, part of the sales synergies from our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments acquisition.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, economic and retail conditions remained challenging in parts of the region. However, in constant currency, we had strong volume-driven sales growth this period, particularly in France, Poland and Russia. 
In France, we're benefiting from our brand marketing and have expanded Ducros brand sales with a discount retailer. Distribution gains are also a primary sales growth driver for our business in Poland and Russia. And in Australia, consumer sales in constant currency rose at a double-digit rate this period from new distribution and product innovation. 
Before moving to the Americas, let's take a look at our lineup of new products for the second half in our EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions on Slide 7. One of our global initiatives is grilling. In EMEA, we are building out our barbecue products in the U.K., France, Poland and other markets with dry seasonings, wet marinades and sauces. And in France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, recognizing the popularity of burgers, we are introducing restaurant-quality burger seasonings in wet and dry sachets. 
Our Aeroplane gelatin in Australia is an iconic brand with 90% category share, and we are continuing to grow sales with new flavor varieties. Also in this market, we will be leveraging the authenticity of our Keene’s brand into curry recipe bases. 
Let's turn to the Americas. In this region, we're making further progress improving the performance of our U.S. consumer business. Consumer interest in flavor, simple and healthy ingredients and cooking with fresh product continues to drive strong category growth for spices and seasoning as seen in the latest consumption data, with category sales up 5% in the quarter. This same data shows that sales of our McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 1%. This is an improvement compared to 1% decline in the past 52 weeks. We are definitely heading in the right direction.
For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we continue to gain share. In this latest quarter, the increase of 50 basis points marked the 20th consecutive month of share gain. We're achieving this through innovation as well as effective marketing for both new products and core items. Within the subsegment of taco seasoning mixes, we increased share of our McCormick brand 3 percentage points in the last 52 weeks, and our share of chili seasoning mixes is up 4 percentage points. 
We grew share of Zatarain's 5% this quarter versus the year-ago period. Zatarain's rice mixes are outpacing the category growth rate, and consumption of our frozen entrées rose 4%. Across all of our U.S. brands, we are driving growth through accelerating innovation, building brand equity and through our category leadership at retail.
On the innovation front, I'll comment on 2 of our recent launches. I'm pleased to report that in less than 1 year, our McCormick Skillet Sauces have exceeded 10% share in this growing category, driven by the retail placement we have gained and our marketing support. The relaunch of our Gourmet line began early in 2015 with greater variety of flavor-sealed technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has a more premium, fresh appearance.
In this subsegment of the spice and seasoning category, nearly 80% of retail distribution points are now converted to the new packaging, and we've seen base consumption trends for McCormick Gourmet strengthen, with consumption up 4% in the second quarter. This gourmet initiative has also helped us expand the number of McCormick brand SKUs on the shelves with existing customers, gain distribution with new customers and at other customers, reduce the number of competitive brands they carry. 
For the second half of 2015, we are excited about our innovation plans. These include extending our liquid recipe mixes platform with the introduction of slow cooker sauces. Flavors include smoky barbecue pulled pork and pot roast with caramelized onion and cracked black pepper. We will introduce additional gluten-free recipe mixes, including beef stew and fajita, to build off the success of our initial varieties and Kitchen Basics stock cubes, the convenient way to boost flavor for soups, stews and risottos with no MSG or artificial flavors, including a vegetarian variety. Also in the Americas region, our launch plans in Canada include additional Skillet Sauces, gluten-free recipe mixes and reduced sodium items. And in Latin America, we are introducing mustard flavors and barbecue sauces. 
A second growth initiative in the U.S. is building brand equity. We had particular success this quarter with our Grill Mates campaign, including excellent in-store display execution, great new television advertising and a 2015 grilling flavor forecast. Second quarter sales of Grill Mates grew 9%, and we expect to maintain this momentum through the peak grilling season.
Through digital marketing, we're connecting directly with consumers. We're moving up the list of go-to places for online recipe. mccormick.com is now in the top 40 recipe destinations, up from 175th in 2012, with 30 million annual visitors and 40 million recipe views. We have the largest online grilling community and are connecting with passionate users of OLD BAY, Zatarain's and other distinctive brands. And behind the scenes, we have better alignment of our digital assets, not only in the U.S. but all around the world. 
We continue to strengthen our retail partnership to drive category growth and engage consumers. On the last call, Alan discussed a sharper focus on our retail price points and advanced analytic rigor around category management. As we roll this out, several retailers have begun to partner with us on shelf price adjustments, and we're very encouraged by the results for them and for McCormick. By the end of the third quarter, we will be ready to launch a new comprehensive category management tool, supported by additional internal resources, and we expect these capabilities to accelerate our progress as it relates to pricing optimization.
As you would expect, this is an account-by-account discussion. As the latest consumption data illustrated, we have reduced the category share decline for our brand, but we're not yet where we want to be. I believe we have the right actions and the right team in place to stabilize and then grow our share. In tandem with these actions, we are driving growth for our recipe mixes as well as niche brands within our U.S. portfolio, such as Lawry's, OLD BAY, Grill Mates, Zatarain's, Thai Kitchen, and now, Drogheria & Alimentari. 
Before I move to our industrial business, I just want to recognize the great performance of our joint venture in Mexico. Despite an unfavorable currency rate, net income for this business rose 36%, mainly due to sales growth and favorable costs. 
Turning now to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and in constant currency, a very strong 7%. These higher sales and our cost-reduction initiatives led to a double-digit increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency. EMEA led the growth this period, with a double-digit constant-currency sales increase and volume and product mix up 9%. This part of our business has had exceptional sales growth for the past 3 years, as seen on Slide 11. 
Whereas our business with quick service restaurants has been a challenge in other regions during this period, we are winning in EMEA with product innovation, and for the third year in a row, were named new product supplier of the year in this region by a leading quick service restaurant customer. We also increased our share of business with quick service restaurants and are supporting the geographic expansion of those customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with food manufacturers we supply, and as an example, have broken ground on a new facility in the Middle East. 
In the Americas region, we're benefiting from an increase in consumer snacking, developing seasonings for snack bars, crackers, chips and similar product. At the same time, our customers are moving toward more simple ingredients, and our foundation in spices and herbs has us well positioned. In the second quarter, we had particularly strong demand from these customers in Latin America, with double-digit sales growth in constant currency. We have a strong base in Mexico and are supporting customer expansion into South America. In Brazil, we cut the ribbon on a small R&D center this quarter to build our expertise in the local flavors. 
We also grew year-on-year sales to food manufacturers in the U.S. this period and had a solid performance with sales of branded food service product. In addition, we had the benefit of sales from Brand Aromatics, acquired early in March. Offsetting a portion of these gains was further weakness in our U.S. sales to quick service restaurants. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, we're pleased to be seeing further recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants. As in the first quarter, we had an added benefit of innovation and limited-time offers and with export sales of products supplied by our facilities in China. Our outlook is for continued improvement through the second half of 2015 for our industrial business in China.
Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back over to Alan."

As Lawrence reported, we're driving solid performance across many parts of our business, demonstrating the effectiveness of our growth strategies and our strong execution. We're making steady progress with our initiatives and encouraged by 2015 results through the first half. 
Next, I would like to provide a few updates from the time of our first quarter earnings call back in late March, starting with acquisition activity. McCormick's business development team is having a busy year with great results. Back in February, we announced an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari and completed this purchase at the end of May. In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics. And about a week ago, we signed an agreement to acquire One World Foods, seller of Stubb's, the #1 brand of premium, authentic barbecue sauce in the U.S. Stubb's products also include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Annual sales of this business are approximately $30 million and are growing at a double-digit rate.
Stubb's is a perfect complement to our products, rounding out our range of grilling items under the Grill Mates, Lawry's and McCormick brands. To maintain the authenticity of this brand, we plan to keep the business headquarters in Austin, Texas. We expect to maintain a double-digit pace of sales growth near term through expanded distribution, increased household penetration and innovative flavors. We anticipate significant cost synergies that will deliver at least $10 million of incremental EBITDA by 2017. At an anticipated purchase price of $100 million, we expect Stubb's to be another attractive deal for McCormick.
Along with our efforts to build sales through acquisitions and the innovation and brand marketing activity that Lawrence discussed, employees throughout the company are making great progress with our efforts to eliminate costs. We reaffirm our goal to achieve at least $85 million in cost savings this year. This will bring our cumulative annual cost savings to more than $400 million since our 2009 launch of McCormick's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI. 
During the second quarter, we announced additional reorganization plans in the EMEA region. These plans include the transfer of certain additional activities to the recently established McCormick shared services center in Poland. While we expect to record charges of approximately $25 million related to these actions, there's a very good payback, with estimated annual cost savings of $16 million by the end of 2017.
We've recently increased our resources to drive our CCI program and expect to continue our track record of productivity improvement throughout the organization.
Let's turn to some recent leadership changes. As announced in early June, we're pleased to have Maritza Montiel and Michael Conway joining our board. Maritza is former deputy CEO and Vice Chairman of Deloitte. During her 40 years with the firm, she led a variety of strategic initiatives prior to retiring in mid-2014. Michael is President of Global Channel Development for Starbucks. He has responsibility for all commercial and business strategy functions and is driving aggressive plans to expand to emerging international markets. Prior to Starbucks, Michael served in leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup. Retiring from our board is J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO of Hershey. He served as a Director since 2005, and we truly appreciate his participation and contributions to our success.
Turning to our company leaders. Cile Perich, Senior VP of Human Resources, retired from McCormick after 32 years of exemplary service and 7 years as a member of our management committee. On Slide 17, we've listed the current members of the management committee, which now include Lisa Manzone, who is promoted to Cile's role; and also, Brendan Foley, who joined us from Heinz about a year ago and whose responsibilities have been broadened from Head of U.S. Consumer Business to a North American role. We also announced in April that Nneka Rimmer has joined the company. Most recently with Boston Consulting Group, Nneka is responsible for shaping overall corporate strategies and working to increase EVA at McCormick. I'm confident that these latest changes will provide strong leadership for our business going forward.
The last topic I want to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to the healthfulness of spices and herbs. Since its formation in 2007, the McCormick Science Institute, MSI, has supported scientific research and dissemination of information on the health benefits of culinary herbs and spices. In 2014, MSI, in partnership with the American Society for Nutrition, hosted a summit of researchers, government officials and health and wellness communicators to discuss the role of herbs and spices in a healthy diet. This message is beginning to resonate. In May, we were pleased to learn that the U.S. dietary guidelines advisory committee has recommended to the government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encourage uses of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. We're optimistic that this change will be made.
In addition, Australia's healthy eating pyramid was recently updated and now encourages people to enjoy herbs and spices to flavor food without using salt. We regard our categories as advantaged, on trend with spicy foods, fresh foods, ethnic cuisine, simple ingredient. This latest health news is just one more reason for consumers to turn to spices and herbs to add flavor. 
It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon for a financial perspective on our results and guidance."

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our 2 segments and in both developed and emerging markets. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 5%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and rose 1%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved 7% growth, a sequential improvement from the first quarter result.
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew second quarter consumer business sales 3% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2014, with contributions from higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions mainly related to honey products in Canada. As Lawrence described, we grew U.S. sales of recipe mixes, Grill Mates and Zatarain's products. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America grew at a double-digit rate this period as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant currency grew 4% as a result of higher volume and product mix. Distribution gains were a major reason for the increase, with wins in France, Poland and Russia. Our brand marketing and innovation are additional factors driving sales, and we look forward to including sales of Drogheria & Alimentari in our results starting in the third quarter.
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 7%, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. Our sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate year-on-year. And Australia also delivered a double-digit increase for the second quarter. We had some further pressure from basmati rice prices in India, leading to lower pricing for the region this period.
In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $81 million compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs, retirement benefit expense and product mix. Also in the second quarter, we recorded about $1 million of transaction costs related to the acquisitions we have announced in 2015.
Turning to our industrial business. We grew second quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix each added 3 percentage points and acquisitions another 1 percentage point of growth. 
In the Americas region, sales rose 5% in constant currency, mainly from pricing actions and the addition of Brand Aromatics. Volume and product mix were comparable to the year-ago period as increased sales of snack seasonings, particularly in Latin America, and higher sales of branded food service products were offset by continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers.
In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 12% in constant currency, with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. As Lawrence described, we are in our third year of exceptional performance in this part of our business as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers. 
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 4% in constant currency. In China, we grew through innovation and export, and the recovery continued from 2014 challenges, with lower demand from major quick service restaurants. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $42 million, well ahead of $36 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the gross -- the growth was even more impressive at 24%, with the benefit of higher sales in our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.
Let's turn to Slide 31. Across both segments, adjusted operating income was $123 million, a 1% increase from $122 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 7%.
This is an improvement from the first quarter as increased cost reductions and additional pricing actions are providing a greater offset to material cost inflation.
These same positive factors are impacting gross profit margin. While we were down 50 basis points year-on-year in the second quarter, this was a better performance than the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we expect our cost reduction and pricing activity to continue to improve gross profit margin. However, we now expect gross profit margin for the fiscal year to be comparable to 2014 rather than up slightly.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 60 basis points even with the impact of transaction costs related to our 2015 acquisition activity. Special charges of $19 million in the second quarter related primarily to the additional actions planned in EMEA that we announced in April. 
Below the operating income line, our effective tax rate was 16%, which was below our initial guidance and year-ago quarter due to $13 million of discrete tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2015. Based on our current outlook, including these benefits and our projected mix of our business across tax jurisdictions, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is approximately 27% compared to our prior guidance of 27% to 28%. This is based on an underlying rate of approximately 29%. 
Keep in mind that in the absence of any further discrete items, we expect an unfavorable variance in the next 2 quarters, with a tax rate of 29% versus 21.4% in the third quarter of 2014 and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Income from unconsolidated operations rose 19%, led by our joint venture in Mexico, which continues to have a strong financial performance, as Lawrence described. This increase is net of an unfavorable currency impact. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.75. As you can see on Slide 34, this was an $0.11 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate, along with increases in our adjusted operating income, unconsolidated income and lower shares outstanding.
Turning next to Slide 35. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $186 million compared to $182 million in the first half of 2014. During the first half of 2015, we used $70 million of cash to acquire nearly 1 million shares of McCormick's stock, occurring mostly in the first quarter. Given our activity to date, we continue to anticipate a 1% reduction in the shares in 2015. At quarter end, we had $46 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. The board approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization in March.
During the second quarter, we used a combination of cash and short-term borrowings to acquire Brand Aromatics for $63 million and make the initial payment of $49 million to acquire Drogheria & Alimentari. Likewise, we expect to use a combination of cash and short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Stubb's later this quarter. 
Consistent with past practice, we have the curtailed our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. The 3 acquisitions we have announced should add at least 1% of growth this year, giving us greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our range. We continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015.
We reaffirm our expected 6% to 7% constant currency growth for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million in adjusted operating income. We continue to anticipate unfavorable currency rates to reduce operating income growth by 3 percentage points. For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 4% to 5% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $54 million estimated impact from special charges.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.47 to $3.54. This is a $0.03 increase from the previous guidance, reflecting the latest tax rate estimate. This new range, excluding an estimated $0.12 headwind from currency, is an increase of 7% to 9% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.25 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. This range assumes a $0.29 impact from special charges.
As you consider the financial projection for the second half versus the year-ago period, keep in mind the projected headwinds from a higher tax rate, unfavorable currency and our plans to increase brand marketing. These factors are expected to cause a double-digit decline in third quarter adjusted earnings per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. However, our projection is to increase fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our acquisition activity, some debt paydown and future share repurchase activity.

The big difference, I think, in our business in China for our consumer segment is that we're a lot less dependent on the modern trade than many of our peer companies. With the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments, we've got a strong foothold in the central part of China, a great penetration in the more traditional segment of the market, and we're experiencing really broad-based growth on both our McCormick brand and on our acquired brands across China. We recognize that there's been some slowdown in economic growth in China, but our categories continue to do well, and our brands, in particular, had really broad-based growth in this quarter.

So when we spoke about this at CAGNY in 2014, our focus was on price gaps versus private label and versus key competitors and having conversations with retailers about those price gaps with the aim of narrowing them, either by reducing the prices on McCormick or frankly, by raising the prices on competitive items that were irrationally priced, in some cases below the retailers' private label. And as we've gone through 2014 and we've developed greater understanding of pricing dynamics, we came to realize that the price gaps actually mattered less than the absolute price points on about a dozen key items. So our initiatives this year had been focused more on managing the absolute price points on those key items, and it does not involve additional pricing action or promotional activity on our part. It's really the way we allocate the promotional spending that we're already doing with the customers, to direct it to the most productive place.

It's a continuation of the journey of the shared service structures and leveraging scale, where we have opportunities to do that. You mentioned a couple of charges. The first charge was primarily our first truly shared service opportunity, which we went to Poland with, and it was focused primarily on the financial end of things. The current activities are, again, related to an extension potentially of other activities into those -- into the same shared service center, so it's broadening shared service. It's the same journey we've gone on here in the U.S. The North American initiative that we took more recently was, again, more of an extension of shared service activity into our North American shared service. And also, in both cases, it's looking at span of control, faster decision-making and how we can delayer decision-making to be more responsive in a very, very competitive market. We do these things very, very analytically and thoughtfully. I -- to say that, well, we would never do anything again would be probably a misstatement, but at the same time, we have to execute what we've already discussed. And as a result, I just -- we need to get done the charges that we already announced this year and execute against those programs."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's third quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflect the effectiveness of our growth strategies and engagement of our employees around the world, with a mid-single di",1046,"Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's third quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflect the effectiveness of our growth strategies and engagement of our employees around the world, with a mid-single digit sales increase in constant currency on our base business and added momentum for our latest acquisitions, we are tracking well toward the upper end of our fiscal year 2015 sales growth targets. 
At the bottom line, despite some added headwinds, we still expect to deliver an increase in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year, including the impact of the unfavorable currency. 
Taking a look at the third quarter, we had a particularly strong broad-based increase at the top line, growing sales 7% in constant currency. We're driving this growth through innovation, brand marketing and the expansion of distribution and current consumer markets like Poland and Latin America and expanded support for our industrial customers as they move into new parts of Asia and the Middle East. The 3 acquisitions completed this year, the latest being Stubb's in August are providing an added boost to McCormick's sales and will have a full impact in the fourth quarter. 
I mentioned that some added 2015 headwinds and these specifically affected our third quarter profit results. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year ago period compared to a 4% increase to the first half. Kohinoor results lowered our growth rate by 2 percentage points. I'll come back to this topic in a minute. Aside from this impact, our strong sales from the savings related to our stepped up cost-reduction programs are more than offsetting increases in material costs and employee benefit expenses. 
Moving to adjusted earnings per share. If you recall at the time of our call back in early July, we guided to a double-digit decline from the year ago period. Due to a projected year-on-year increase in the tax rate resulting from the favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter of 2014, our guidance also anticipated some added pressure from currency. Our actual results for the quarter at $0.85 of adjusted earnings per share was down about 10% from the year ago period, right in line with our guidance. 
We continue to generate strong cash flow and continue to have a balance use of cash in 2015 with similar amounts invested in the business through acquisitions and return to McCormick shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Before I update you on our latest outlook, I want to recognize McCormick employees and our leadership team for their focus on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success. We're 1 month into our fourth quarter and have a positive view for this last and largest quarter of fiscal year 2015. Gordon's going to provide some specific financial guidance but let me share a few remarks. 
Given our year-to-date results and momentum and the added benefit of our acquisitions, we're tracking toward the upper end of our 4% to 6% sales growth target. An important factor in this outlook is the continued strength in the category growth for spices and seasonings in the U.S. and our progress in improving our consumer business in this market. Lawrence will have more to share on this. 
We have a more conservative outlook for adjusted earnings per share than we had back in early July, reflecting the impact of Kohinoor and the recent decline of the Mexican peso, which affects income from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. We recognized our profit growth in 2015 is below our long-term target of 9% to 11% but overall, we feel good about our performance this year and our ability to address these specific headwinds. 
As we shared in this morning's press release, we've raised our expected cost savings and will use this fuel for growth for more aggressively brand marketing support during the fourth quarter holiday period. 
Let's move onto my comments about Kohinoor. As many of you recall, in 2011, MacCormick purchased a majority interest in India, entering the rice business with a strong category share, well established and extensive route to market and a great brand name. Our intent was to continue to drive the growth of rice sales in India and use this business as a springboard into other branded products such as seasoned rice mixes and herbs and spices. 
Since 2011, we've built a capable leadership team, increased our distribution and introduced several new products. However, certain parts of this business have led to underperformance. We recently made a decision to exit certain low-margin product lines and bring greater focus to higher-margin items and our expansion plans. This decision triggered a non-cash impairment charge and some additional cost recorded in the third quarter that Gordon will discuss. 
We continue to regard India as a compelling long-term growth market for McCormick. With this action, we expect to improve our Kohinoor business and with our other 2 joint ventures, more fully participate in the enormous growth potential in this market. 
Let me circle back with the remark about our step up cost-reduction program. Across functions and in countries around the world, McCormick employees are working to lower-cost. And we've added leadership resources behind this effort. We now expect to deliver at least $75 million from our comprehensive continuous improvement program. This is an increase of $10 million from our initial guidance. 
Together with $20 million of projected savings from our streamlining actions, we now anticipate total cost savings of at least $95 million in 2015. This is a significant increase from last year's record $69 million in annual cost savings. 
Before I turn it over to Lawrence, I want to point to the strong momentum underway as we head into the fourth quarter and our 2016 fiscal year. My enthusiasm and confidence in this business starts with our advantage categories and engaged employees. Our products are on trend with today's consumer. Across nearly all of our markets, people are exploring new flavors, seeking fresh, simple ingredients, focus on sourcing quality and working to improve their bellies. Keep these trends in mine as Lawrence provide the business updates, and you'll see how they continue to shape our growth strategy, including innovation, brand positioning and acquisition. 
I'll turn it over to Lawrence."

Consumer trends setting our direction for both of our segments, consumer and industrial. Investors continue to be interested in progress with our U.S. consumer business, that will be the focus of my initial remarks and then I'll move on to several other key consumer markets, followed by an update on McCormick's industrial business. 
For our U.S. consumer business, we have actions underway to improve this business for nearly 2 years now that include accelerating innovation, building our brand equity and winning at retail. Our quarterly business results in 2015 are showing steady progress with these actions. 
Our largest category, spices and seasonings, remains strong with consumption up 5% during the third quarter. This same data indicates we grew consumption of McCormick brand spices and seasonings 2% this period, which is a sequential improvement from a 1% increase in the second quarter. We will continue to work toward a growth rate that is at parity with the category. 
Within this broader category, I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our Gourmet line. We launched about 6 months ago consumption results for the fourth quarter show a 4% increase maintaining the strong pace we set last quarter. 
For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we achieved a 23rd consecutive month of share gain driven by innovation and effective marketing for both new product and core items. Our liquid McCormick skillet sauces in the market for a year now have reached a category share of 10% and continue to grow. 
During this period, we also had standout sales results with Zatarain's, Grill Mates and Kitchen Basics. 
On the innovation front, we discussed most of our new second quarter products back in the July call, including additional varieties of gluten-free recipe mixes, new Slow Cookers Skillet Sauces and Kitchen Basics stock cubes. Our latest breakthrough innovation is Herb Grinders, which are just starting to appear on retail shelves. Herb grinders continued delivered a flavor and aroma of fresh herbs, Larger pieces and gently drive to a proprietary process that protects color and flavor. We're excited about the results of this product and consumer testing. 
2/3 of consumers use the grinder every 3 days before end and during meal preparation as well as at the table. As you can appreciate, we've created a significant opportunity to convert consumers that currently purchase package fresh herbs to our new Grinders. 
In building brand equity, our 2015 emphasis has been on easy ways to prepare healthy meals, new product news and freshness and purity. You'll be hearing a lot of from us in this quarter as brand marketing increase to nearly 10% across all markets with a portion here in the U.S. this for the new purity campaign. 
We're interested consumer-facing message on freshness and purity, one that let's consumer know that McCormick purchase is the best spices and herbs from around the world. We know the origin and we control the quality. And recent large industry recall of ground cumin, we were able to reassure consumers that the purity of McCormick cumin. 
We also have additional moves on wellness as it relates to our products. Last quarter, we shared with you that the U.S. dietary guidelines advisory committee recommended to the federal government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encourage the use of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. This summer, the USDA issued a recommendation to school nutritionists to use herbs and spices for more appealing taste and a way to reduce sodium. In fact, the new tagline of their program is Spice It Up. Also for people 65 and older, the USDA recommended using spices and herbs to compensate for changes in the sense of smell and taste. 
While this is top of mind for a lot of consumers these days, and many of them are equating this with certain attributes, like gluten-free and non-GMO and organic. To continue to shape our product portfolio for the evolving consumer, we recently committed to labeling more than 70% of our McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts in the U.S., non-GMO within 1 year. 
Appearing on retail shelves right now is our first product to carry the non-GMO designation, McCormick brand vanilla extract. In addition, by the end of 2016, 80% of our Gourmet line will be organic, up from 10% today. This news is being well received by our consumers. We're eager to get these products in front of consumers and are continuing to evaluate related initiatives in the U.S. and other markets. 
In addition to high-impact brand marketing messages, we need an effectively means of delivery, which includes digital marketing. McCormick is not alone in this shift toward digital marketing as a better way to reach consumers and to achieve a higher ROI on our spending. In 2015, we're planning for digital marketing to reach 1/3 of our global advertising, up from 11% in 2010. We put a lot of effort and resources into staying at the forefront of digital and e-commerce and these investments are paying off. I'm proud to share that McCormick ranked #5 out of 114 food brands in the U.S. market on LT2's latest digital index. This firm scores companies on several key factors, including digital marketing presence and social media community size, content and engagement. The Digital IQ index also considered e-commerce effectiveness. For the e-commerce channel, we're equally proud of the recent award from Amazon, which named McCormick supplier of the year for grocery. 
Just as important, if not more so, are our efforts and resources partnering with our retail customers. Slide 15 shows the time line of activity that has been underway for about 2 years now and leading up to our latest investment in category, management tools and resources. Compared to last year, we have increased this investment fivefold, focusing on price modeling and assortment optimization across our top categories. This quarter, with an expanded team, we're mobilizing our insights and tools to optimize sales and profit for us and for our customers. We are in the very early stages of this activity and just beginning to share insights with retail customers. I'm excited about the potential for these new tools and customer discussions as we head into 2016. 
Another area of investor interest has been our consumer business in China. We continue to achieve double-digit constant-currency sales growth in this market in contrast to some other consumer products company. Given the broader impact of the economy on consumer retail purchases, to date, our business had seen less of an impact and our leadership in China is cautiously optimistic. In our top 3 categories, average spend per household has continued to grow and McCormick is gaining share through brand marketing, in-store execution, continued geographic expansion, including cross-selling of our McCormick brand in Central China following the acquisition of Asia-Pacific condiments. 
Moving to our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA, we have strong 18% constant-currency sales growth in the third quarter despite some challenging retail environments, especially in the U.K. We achieved increases in both the U.K. and France with a significant increase in brand marketing, and from innovation, including grilling products, dessert items.. 
In both Poland and Russia, the big driver has been expanded distribution, including with new retailer. And our acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari gave a further boost to sale, adding 11 percentage points of our increase. 
Turning now to industrial business. I'm going to start as I did last quarter with our results in EMEA. The third quarter of 201 marked another period of outstanding sales growth as our team in this market is winning in all fronts, particularly with quick service restaurants. We're winning with product innovation, distribution gains and supporting the geographic expansion of these customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with the food manufacturers we supply, including new facility we have under construction in the Middle East. 
In the Americas region we had a solid performance but mixed results. The growth this quarter came from pricing, our Brand Aromatics acquisition and sales from our operations in Mexico. However, these gains were partially offset by lower sales to quick service restaurant customers that are working through a period of weak consumer demand in the U.S we're partnering with these customers on ways for them to drive their sales growth and are also selectively building relationships with other food service customers in the U.S. 
In our Asia/Pacific region, we had a strong increase in new industrial product shipped from our operation in Australia. In China, the recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants has continued from a year ago period when these customers were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding a quality issue from a supplier of protein. 
To wrap up my remarks, employees and business leaders throughout the company are driving our success. We have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter and beyond with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for a better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, with aggressive cost-savings program underway and a culture of participation and high-performance. 
Thank you, and it's my pleasure to turn it over now to Gordon."

Aside from the Kohinoor performance, our overall results were generally in li",1619,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we had some very strong performance in parts of our business along with significant headwinds. Aside from the Kohinoor performance, our overall results were generally in line with the guidance we shared with you back in June. Let's start with a closer look at McCormick's third quarter sales and profits, followed by comments on our cash flow and balance sheet and then the details of our latest guidance. 
On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step up from what we have seen year-to-date with a 7% increase that included 2 percentage points from our acquisitions. 
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew third quarter consumer business sales 7% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix for our base business as well as a full quarter of sales from the Drogheria & Alimentari acquisitions and about 2 weeks of Stubb's. We grew sales in the Americas with our largest increases in recipe mixes, Grill Mates, Kitchen Basics and Zatarain's in the U.S. 
Product innovation and brand marketing support, particularly in digital, as Lawrence described, are driving these results. We are pleased with our progress based on the latest consumption data. 
While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America had another quarter of double-digit sales growth as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance and had the added benefit of DNA sales this quarter. The core business growth was broad-based with increases in each of our top markets driven by our higher brand marketing, our new product innovation and expanded distribution. 
In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia-Pacific region at a double-digit rate in both China and Australia, again, this quarter. In China, sales of bullion products were particularly strong. In India, lower pricing more than offset a slight increase in volume and product mix. 
The consumer business in total, our third quarter adjusted operating income was down from the year ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income declined 3% from the year ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense. In addition, operating income from Kohinoor was down $3 million from the third quarter of 2014. 
Turning to our industrial business. We grew third quarter sales a robust 8% in constant currency from the year ago period. This increase was led by higher volume and product mix, followed by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and by sales of Brand Aromatics that we acquired earlier this year. 
As shown on Slide 27, sales of Brand Aromatics contact contributed 2.5 percentage points to our growth in the Americas. We also had higher pricing for total sales increase of 5% in constant currency. 
In the third quarter, strong sales from our operation in Mexico were largely offset by continued weakness in U.S. sales to quick service restaurant customers. 
Our industrial business in the EMEA continues to post impressive growth with sales this period up 15% in constant currency. Higher volume, along with our CCI actions, is driving greater profitability for this business, too. As we indicated, this is a third year of exceptional performance as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. 
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 12% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business rose 5% from the third quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth reached 12% with a benefit of higher sales and our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and increased employee benefit expense. 
Let's turn to Slide 31. While adjusted operating income, excluding special charges declined 4%, if we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, our third quarter results was up slightly from the year ago period. This is despite the $3 million decline in Kohinoor profit. 
Gross profit margin declined 50 basis points. Included in this result is the impact of Kohinoor, which lowered the gross profit margin by 54 basis points. So we are seeing an underlying sequential improvement from the first half of 2015 as the benefit of our cost-savings actions build and pricing actions are implemented. 
The 54 basis point reduction to gross profit from Kohinoor was comprised of $3 million of special charges included in cost of goods sold, which represents an inventory write-down directly related to the decision to discontinue the sales of certain lower-margin product lines, along with a $2 million year-on-year decline in Kohinoor's gross profit prior to that special charge. Even with this third quarter result, we still expect our fiscal year 2015 gross profit margin to be comparable to 2014. 
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense rose 60 basis points due in part to increased employee benefit expense. In addition to higher retirement benefit expense, there were increases in incentive compensation for those parts of the business performing ahead of plan. Also, the percentage increase in brand marketing this period at 5%, or $2 million, exceeded our rate of sales growth this quarter. 
As described in this morning's press release, there were 3 components in the special charges we recorded in the third quarter. $10 million for the non-cash impairment of the Kohinoor brand name; $3 million for special charges in cost of goods sold, as I just described; and $2 million of charges that related to previously announced streamlining actions in EMEA and North America. 
For the fiscal year, we now estimate total charges of $65 million. This assumes $2 million of additional charges in the fourth quarter. 
Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 30%, an increase from 21% in the third quarter of 2014, which was the primary reason why we guided to a double-digit year-on-year decline in adjusted earnings per share this period. If you recall, in the third quarter of 2014, we had a significant favorable impact from discrete tax items. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter of 2015 based on our current outlook. 
Income from unconsolidated operations rose this quarter. This increase was largely the net result of 3 factors. Underline growth in our unconsolidated income led by our joint venture in Mexico, the unfavorable impact of a dramatic decline in the Mexican peso and a favorable $2 million impact related to an allocation of the $13 million in special charges to Kohinoor's minority interest. 
As a result of the increased weakness of the Mexican peso, we now anticipate our income from unconsolidated operations for the fiscal year to be up slightly versus our previous estimate of at least 10%. 
At the bottom line, third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85. As you can see on Slide 34, this was a $0.10 decline from the year ago period due in large part to the tax rate and adjusted operating income. 
Turning next to Slide 35, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations was $317 million compared to $276 million in the year ago period. This year, we have returned $226 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and expect to be back in the market for share repurchases this quarter. 
We used $211 million of cash and short-term borrowings for our 3 acquisitions and our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was at 2.0 at quarter end, slightly above our target of 1.5 to 1.8. 
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. 
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. Alan already provided perspective on this, so let me quickly run through the numbers. We reaffirmed our expectation to grow sales in constant currency at the upper end of a 4% to 6% range. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 percentage point to this increase, and we continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015. We now expect to be at the lower end of a 6% to 7% constant-currency growth rate for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million. We now anticipate that unfavorable currency rates will reduce operating income growth by 4 percentage points, up from 3 percentage points.
Operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 7% to 8% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $65 million estimated impact from special charges, up from our prior estimate of $54 million with the increase due to the third quarter charges. 
We also expect to be at the lower end of $347 million to $354 million in adjusted earnings per share. This range assumes a $0.13 unfavorable impact on operating income from currency. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.18, including a $0.36 impact from special charges. For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This is providing funds for our dividend payments, our acquisition activities, debt paydown and share repurchases committee. 
Let's turn now to your questions and then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

But one of the key, I guess, effort the last couple of quarters or getting those price points in the right place on some of those top sort of key items, right, in the urban space. Is there any way you can share a couple of metrics with us on maybe where you are in that process? Do you know have those on the right price points? Are you most of the ways of there?

We're really pleased with the progress that we've made on our management of price points with the customers. When I talk about being at the beginning of a process here in our prepared remarks, it's really in reference to the use of the new tools that we added in the middle of the third quarter. So we have a time set up and with most of our leading customers in the U.S. to work through analytics with them around both pricing and on assortment, and the 2 really need to work together. We've added new modeling tools for both pricing and assortment, they work together in tandem. And we expect to get through about 50% of customers in that -- by the end of the fourth quarter this year. So that's pretty good progress. In terms of implementing what we've done so far on the price points on those key items, we've made a lot of progress and that is part of the reason for the strength of our business. But we don't want to underestimate the value of the other things that we're doing in terms of innovation and gain AMT to drive our core business. So one of the other things that you're starting to see now is innovation in the core part of our business with things like the herb grinder, you're seeing renovation of our core business to kind of take away the reason for being some of these smaller brands that have made inroads against us. So kind of the expansion of with our Gourmet line, the non-GMO the building on our, of course, price line, these are all imported consumer elements that go beyond price to get out the consumer and build the strength of our core brand. We're very committed to getting not only during the core business, but the winning market share in the business as well."

An example of that we're moving into some areas that are more closely related to what we do, but not directly. So we have room to grow there. And Stubb's specifically puts us into more of a natural and interesting category. Our Stubb's business doesn't have high fructose corn syrup, it's gluten-free, and so it differentiate itself in its premium in the category. So we forget about that. The other acquisitions that we're making, we're continuing to target are those leading companies in markets where we have either small persons or are no presence, and so that's what we did with DNA this year. And we're also targeting more flavor acquisitions for our industrial business. So while we've done very few over the last 10 years, we see that as an opportunity to really build and grow our business.

Rob, on the category management effort, I want to separate that from the idea of price increase. We are working to manage to get our key items to critical price points within our existing spend on in promotion by managing the use of promotional funds and directing that toward the most productive purpose. In our U.S. business, we have not taken the price increase in 2014 or 2015. So what is reading through maybe in the Nielsen as movement in price is more the way Nielsen reports units and the amount of weight per package. But there hasn't been any kind of pricing action in the U.S. either last year or this year. And our promotional spending is pretty much in line with what it has been historically. All of that category management work has redirected existing promotional funds."

But may be bigger picture question about the earnings guide maybe to tell us somethings. When you go back to -- I mean, when I look at the below your 9% to 11% earnings growth that we've seen for the past few years, a couple years anyway, I mean, currencies clearly played a huge role in that and then I look back at digging through -- you had about 3 or 4 quarters back in '08, '09 where currency just crushed you at like twice the magnitude. And the difference it seems to me is that more acquisition tailwind back then, but you priced a lot more aggressively. And so it leaves me -- I guess, two questions. First should be, I guess different -- what's different kind of this time. It seems like especially overseas markets the are affected by currency, it seems like your a little bit more shy to price to that currency and cost obviously. I know it's a lot of these costs wind up being denominated something like dollars, if not explicitly dollars. And I guess secondly when you look at that 9% to 11% earnings algorithm, it seems likes it's the right thing to do for your business, the balance of volume and pricing like that in the face of currency headwinds. Do you think that maybe 9% to 11% earnings wise is -- is that a signal that maybe that's too much as far as what the core business, you should be able to sustain prudently? Those are my questions."

But specifically to pricing, what we saw in 2009, '10 and '11 and '12 was extreme commodity inflation, and so we're trying to respond to that. We've had some of that in this year, and we recognize that what we're really focused on is getting our price threshold right in the marketplace. And that's not unique to the U.S. It's around world. And so we kind of taken a positive if on pricing. We've taken some pricing to offset currency in some of our markets, but our focus has been more on getting the right price thresholds and making sure that we're not giving consumers or customers a reason to go somewhere else. So that's really what we've seen more this year. Around the overall EPS guidance of 9% to 11%, we're still pretty confident that over time, that is an achievable target. obviously, year to year we have to make adjustments based on what's happening. This year, we had the particular headwinds around pension cost and our own currency. While we offset some commodity inflation, but we still feel over time that, that's the right targets. Remember that includes some contribution from acquisitions in the years.

With a mid-single-di",1047,"Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's third quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflect the effectiveness of our growth strategies and engagement of our employees around the world. With a mid-single-digit sales increase in constant currency on our base business and added momentum for our latest acquisitions, we are tracking well toward the upper end of our fiscal year 2015 sales growth targets. At the bottom line, despite some added headwinds, we still expect to deliver an increase in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year, including the impact of the unfavorable currency. 
Taking a look at the third quarter. We had a particularly strong broad-based increase at the top line, growing sales 7% in constant currency. We're driving this growth through innovation, brand marketing and the expansion of distribution in current consumer markets like Poland and Latin America and expanded support for our industrial customers as they move into new parts of Asia and the Middle East. The 3 acquisitions completed this year, the latest being Stubb's in August, are providing an added boost to McCormick's sales and will have a full impact in the fourth quarter. 
I mentioned that some added 2015 headwinds, and these specifically affected our third quarter profit results. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period compared to a 4% increase through the first half. Kohinoor results lowered our growth rate by 2 percentage points. I'll come back to this topic in a minute. Aside from this impact, our strong sales from the savings related to our stepped-up cost reduction programs are more than offsetting increases in material costs and employee benefit expenses. 
Moving to adjusted earnings per share. If you recall at the time of our call back in early July, we guided to a double-digit decline from the year-ago period due to a projected year-on-year increase in the tax rate resulting from the favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter of 2014. Our guidance also anticipated some added pressure from currency. Our actual results for the quarter at $0.85 of adjusted earnings per share was down about 10% from the year-ago period, right in line with our guidance. We continue to generate strong cash flow and continue to have a balanced use of cash in 2015 with similar amounts invested in the business through acquisitions and return to McCormick shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Before I update you on our latest outlook, I want to recognize McCormick employees and our leadership team for their focus on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success. We're 1 month into our fourth quarter and have a positive view for this last and largest quarter of fiscal year 2015. Gordon is going to provide some specific financial guidance, but let me share a few remarks. 
Given our year-to-date results and momentum and the added benefit of our acquisitions, we're tracking toward the upper end of our 4% to 6% sales growth target. An important factor in this outlook is the continued strength in the category growth for spices and seasonings in the U.S. and our progress in improving our consumer business in this market. Lawrence will have more to share on this. 
We have a more conservative outlook for adjusted earnings per share than we had back in early July, reflecting the impact of Kohinoor and the recent decline of the Mexican peso, which affects income from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. We recognize our profit growth in 2015 is below our long-term target of 9% to 11%. But overall, we feel good about our performance this year and our ability to address these specific headwinds. As we shared in this morning's press release, we've raised our expected cost savings and will use this fuel for growth for more aggressive brand marketing support during the fourth quarter holiday period. 
Let's move on to my comments about Kohinoor. As many of you recall, in 2011, McCormick purchased a majority interest in India, entering the basmati rice business with a strong category share, well-established and extensive route to market and a great brand name. Our intent was to continue to drive the growth of basmati rice sales in India and use this business as a springboard into other branded products, such as seasoned rice mixes and herbs and spices. Since 2011, we've built a capable leadership team, increased our distribution and introduced several new products. 
However, certain parts of this business have led to underperformance. We recently made a decision to exit certain low-margin product lines and bring greater focus to higher-margin items and our expansion plans. This decision triggered a noncash impairment charge and some additional cost recorded in the third quarter that Gordon will discuss. We continue to regard India as a compelling long-term growth market for McCormick. With this action, we expect to improve our Kohinoor business and with our other 2 joint ventures, more fully participate in the enormous growth potential in this market. 
Let me circle back with a remark about our stepped-up cost reduction programs. Across functions and in countries around the world, McCormick employees are working to lower costs. And we've added leadership resources behind this effort. We now expect to deliver at least $75 million from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program. This is an increase of $10 million from our initial guidance. Together with $20 million of projected savings from our streamlining actions, we now anticipate total cost savings of at least $95 million in 2015. This is a significant increase from last year's record $69 million in annual cost savings. 
Before I turn it over to Lawrence, I want to point to the strong momentum underway as we head into the fourth quarter and our 2016 fiscal year. My enthusiasm and confidence in this business starts with our advantaged categories and engaged employees. Our products are on trend with today's consumer. Across nearly all of our markets, people are exploring new flavors, seeking fresh, simple ingredients, focused on source and quality and working to improve their wellness. Keep these trends in mind as Lawrence provides a business update, and you'll see how they continue to shape our growth strategies, including innovation, brand positioning and acquisitions. 
I'll turn it over to Lawrence."

Consumer trends are indeed setting our direction for both of our segments, consumer and industrial. Investors continued to be interested in progress with our U.S. consumer business. That will be the focus of my",1550,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Consumer trends are indeed setting our direction for both of our segments, consumer and industrial. Investors continued to be interested in progress with our U.S. consumer business. That will be the focus of my initial remarks, and then I'll move on to several other key consumer markets, followed by an update on McCormick's industrial business. 
For our U.S. consumer business, we have had actions underway to improve this business for nearly 2 years now that include accelerating innovation, building our brand equity and winning at retail. Our quarterly business results in 2015 are showing steady progress with these actions. Our largest category, spices and seasonings, remained strong with consumption up 5% during the third quarter. This same data indicates we grew consumption of McCormick brand spices and seasonings 2% this period, which is a sequential improvement from a 1% increase in the second quarter. We will continue to work toward a growth rate that is at parity with the category. 
Within this broader category, we are particularly pleased with the performance of our Gourmet line. Relaunched about 6 months ago, consumption results for the fourth quarter show a 4% increase, maintaining the strong pace we set last quarter. For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we achieved a 23rd consecutive month of share gain driven by innovation and effective marketing for both new product and core items. Our liquid McCormick Skillet Sauces in the market for a year now have reached a category share of 10% and continued to grow. During this period, we also had standout sales results with Zatarain's, Grill Mates and Kitchen Basics. 
On the innovation front, we discussed most of our new second quarter products back in the July call, including additional varieties of gluten-free recipe mixes, new slow cooker Skillet Sauces and Kitchen Basics stock cubes. Our latest breakthrough innovation is herb grinders, which are just starting to appear on retail shelves. Herb grinders conveniently deliver the flavor and aroma of fresh herbs. The herbs are in larger pieces and gently dried through a proprietary process that protects color and flavor. We're excited about the results of this product in consumer testing. 2/3 of consumers use the grinder every 3 days both before and during meal preparation as well as at the table. As you can appreciate, we've created a significant opportunity to convert consumers that currently purchase packaged fresh herbs to our new Grinders. 
In building brand equity, our 2015 emphasis has been on easy ways to prepare healthy meals, new product news and freshness and purity. You'll be hearing a lot of from us this quarter as brand marketing increases nearly 10% as planned across all markets with a portion here in the U.S. to support a new purity campaign. We're introducing a distinct consumer-facing message on freshness and purity, one that lets consumers know that McCormick purchases the best spices and herbs from around the world. We know the origin and we control the quality. In a recent large industry recall of ground cumin, we were able to reassure consumers of the purity of McCormick's cumin. 
We also have additional news on wellness as it relates to our products. Last quarter, we shared with you that the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended to the federal government that the 2015 Dietary Guidelines encourage the use of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. This summer, the USDA issued a recommendation to school nutritionists to use herbs and spices for more appealing taste and as a way to reduce sodium. In fact, the new tagline of their program is Spice It Up. Also for people 65 and older, the USDA recommended using spices and herbs to compensate for changes in the sense of smell and taste. 
Wellness is top of mind for a lot of consumers these days and many of them are equating this with certain attributes, like gluten-free, non-GMO and organic. To continue to shape our product portfolio for the evolving consumer, we recently committed to labeling more than 70% of our McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts in the U.S. non-GMO within 1 year. Appearing on retail shelves right now is our first product to carry the non-GMO designation, McCormick brand vanilla extract. In addition, by the end of 2016, 80% of our Gourmet line will be organic, up from 10% today. This news is being well received by our consumers. We're eager to get these products in front of consumers and are continuing to evaluate related initiatives in the U.S. and other markets. 
In addition to high-impact brand marketing messages, we need an effective means of delivery, which includes digital marketing. McCormick is not alone in this shift toward digital marketing as a better way to reach consumers and to achieve a higher ROI on our spending. In 2015, we're planning for digital marketing to reach 1/3 of our global advertising, up from 11% in 2010. We've put a lot of effort and resources into staying at the forefront of digital and e-commerce and these investments are paying off. I'm proud to share that McCormick ranked #5 out of 114 food brands in the U.S. market on L2's latest Digital IQ Index. This firm scores companies on several key factors, including digital marketing presence and social media community size, content and engagement. The Digital IQ Index also considers e-commerce effectiveness. For the e-commerce channel, we're equally proud of the recent award from Amazon, which named McCormick supplier of the year for grocery. 
Just as important, if not more so, are our efforts in resources devoted to partnering with our retail customers. Slide 15 shows a time line of activity that has been underway for about 2 years now and leading up to our latest investment in category management tools and resources. Compared to last year, we have increased this investment fivefold, focusing on price modeling and assortment optimization across our top categories. This quarter, with an expanded team, we're mobilizing our insights and tools to optimize sales and profit for us and for our customers. We are in the very early stages of this activity and just beginning to share insights with retail customers. I'm excited about the potential for these new tools and customer discussions as we head into 2016. 
Another area of investor interest has been our consumer business in China. We continue to achieve double-digit constant currency sales growth in this market in contrast to some other consumer products companies. Given the broader impact of the economy on consumer retail purchases, to date, our business had seen less of an impact and our leadership in China is cautiously optimistic. In our top 3 categories, average spend per household has continued to grow and McCormick is gaining share through brand marketing, in-store execution and continued geographic expansion, including cross-selling of our McCormick brand in Central China following the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments. 
Moving to our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA. We had strong 18% constant currency sales growth in the third quarter despite some challenging retail environments, especially in the U.K. We achieved increases in both the U.K. and France with a significant increase in brand marketing and from innovation, including grilling products and Vahiné brand dessert items. In both Poland and Russia, the big driver has been expanded distribution, including with new retailers. And our acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari gave a further boost to sales, adding 11 percentage points of our increase. 
Turning now to industrial business. I'm going to start as I did last quarter with our results in EMEA. The third quarter of 2015 marked another period of outstanding sales growth as our team in this market is winning on all fronts, particularly with quick service restaurants. We're winning with product innovation, distribution gains and supporting the geographic expansion of these customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with the food manufacturers we supply, including the new facility we have under construction in the Middle East.  
In the Americas region, we had a solid performance but mixed results. The growth this quarter came from pricing, our Brand Aromatics acquisition and sales from our operation in Mexico. However, these gains were partially offset by lower sales to quick service restaurant customers that are working through a period of weak consumer demand in the U.S. We're partnering with these customers on ways for them to drive their sales growth and are also selectively building relationships with other food service customers in the U.S. In our Asia/Pacific region, we had a strong increase in new industrial products shipped from our operation in Australia. In China, the recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants has continued from the year-ago period when these customers were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding a quality issue from a supplier of protein. 
To wrap up my remarks, employees and business leaders throughout the company are driving our success. We have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter and beyond with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for a better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. 
Thank you. And it's my pleasure to turn it over now to Gordon."

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we had some very strong performance in parts of our business along with significant headwinds. Aside from the Kohinoor performance, our overall results were generally in li",1614,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we had some very strong performance in parts of our business along with significant headwinds. Aside from the Kohinoor performance, our overall results were generally in line with the guidance we shared with you back in June. Let's start with a closer look at McCormick's third quarter sales and profit, followed by comments on our cash flow and balance sheet, and then the details of our latest guidance. On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step-up from what we have seen year-to-date with a 7% increase that included 2 percentage points from our acquisitions. 
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew third quarter consumer business sales 7% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix for our base business as well as a full quarter of sales from the Drogheria & Alimentari acquisition and about 2 weeks of Stubb's. We grew sales in the Americas with our largest increases in recipe mixes, Grill Mates, Kitchen Basics and Zatarain's in the U.S. Product innovation and brand marketing support, particularly in digital as Lawrence described, are driving these results. We are pleased with our progress based on the latest consumption data. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America had another quarter of double-digit sales growth as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, we continued to achieve strong sales performance and had the added benefit of D&A sales this quarter. The core business growth was broad-based with increases in each of our top markets, driven by our higher brand marketing, our new product innovation and expanded distribution. In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region at a double-digit rate in both China and Australia again this quarter. In China, sales of bullion products were particularly strong. In India, lower pricing more than offset a slight increase in volume and product mix. 
For the consumer business in total, our third quarter adjusted operating income was down from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income declined 3% from the year-ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense. In addition, operating income from Kohinoor was down $3 million from the third quarter of 2014. 
Turning to our industrial business. We grew third quarter sales a robust 8% in constant currency from the year-ago period. This increase was led by higher volume and product mix, followed by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and by sales of Brand Aromatics that we acquired earlier this year. 
As shown on Slide 27, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 2.5 percentage points to our growth in the Americas. We also had higher pricing for a total sales increase of 5% in constant currency. In the third quarter, strong sales from our operation in Mexico were largely offset by continued weakness in U.S. sales to quick service restaurant customers. 
Our industrial business in EMEA continues to post impressive growth with sales this period up 15% in constant currency. Higher volume, along with our CCI actions, is driving greater profitability for this business, too. As we indicated, this is the third year of exceptional performance as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. 
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 12% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business rose 5% from the third quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth reached 12% with the benefit of higher sales and our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and increased employee benefit expense. 
Let's turn to Slide 31. While adjusted operating income, excluding special charges, declined 4%, if we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, our third quarter result was up slightly from the year-ago period. This is despite the $3 million decline in Kohinoor profit. Gross profit margin declined 50 basis points. Included in this result is the impact of Kohinoor, which lowered the gross profit margin by 54 basis points. So we are seeing an underlying sequential improvement from the first half of 2015 as the benefit of our cost savings actions build and pricing actions are implemented. The 54 basis point reduction to gross profit from Kohinoor was comprised of $3 million of special charges included in cost of goods sold, which represents an inventory write-down directly related to the decision to discontinue the sales of certain lower-margin product lines, along with a $2 million year-on-year decline in Kohinoor's gross profit prior to that special charge. Even with this third quarter result, we still expect our fiscal year 2015 gross profit margin to be comparable to 2014. 
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense rose 60 basis points due in part to increased employee benefit expense. In addition to higher retirement benefit expense, there were increases in incentive compensation for those parts of the business performing ahead of plan. Also the percentage increase in brand marketing this period at 5% or $2 million exceeded our rate of sales growth this quarter. As described in this morning's press release, there were 3 components for the special charges we recorded in the third quarter: $10 million for the noncash impairment of the Kohinoor brand name; $3 million for special charges in cost of goods sold, as I just described; and $2 million of charges that related to previously announced streamlining actions in EMEA and North America. For the fiscal year, we now estimate total charges of $65 million. This assumes $2 million of additional charges in the fourth quarter. 
Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 30%, an increase from 21% in the third quarter of 2014, which was the primary reason why we guided to a double-digit year-on-year decline in adjusted earnings per share this period. If you recall, in the third quarter of 2014, we had a significant favorable impact from discrete tax items. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter of 2015 based on our current outlook. 
Income from unconsolidated operations rose this quarter. This increase was largely the net result of 3 factors: underlying growth in our unconsolidated income led by our joint venture in Mexico; the unfavorable impact of a dramatic decline in the Mexican peso; and a favorable $2 million impact related to an allocation of the $13 million in special charges to Kohinoor's minority interest. As a result of the increased weakness of the Mexican peso, we now anticipate our income from unconsolidated operations for the fiscal year to be up slightly versus our previous estimate of at least 10%. At the bottom line, third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85. As you can see on Slide 34, this was a $0.10 decline from the year-ago period due in large part to the tax rate and adjusted operating income. 
Turning next to Slide 35. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations was $317 million compared to $276 million in the year-ago period. This year, we have returned $226 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and expect to be back in the market for share repurchases this quarter. We used $211 million of cash and short-term borrowings for our 3 acquisitions and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was at 2.0 at quarter end, slightly above our target of 1.5 to 1.8. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. 
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. Alan already provided perspective on this, so let me quickly run through the numbers. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales in constant currency at the upper end of a 4% to 6% range. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 percentage point to this increase, and we continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015. We now expect to be at the lower end of a 6% to 7% constant currency growth rate for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million. We now anticipate that unfavorable currency rates will reduce operating income growth by 4 percentage points, up from 3 percentage points.
For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 7% to 8% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $65 million estimated impact from special charges, up from our prior estimate of $54 million with the increase due to the third quarter charges. We also expect to be at the lower end of $3.47 to $3.54 in adjusted earnings per share. This range assumes a $0.13 unfavorable impact on operating income from currency. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.18, including a $0.36 impact from special charges. For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This is providing funds for our dividend payments, our acquisition activity, debt paydown and share repurchase activity. 
Let's turn now to your questions, and then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

But one of the key, I guess, efforts the last couple of quarters is sort of getting those price points in the right place on some of those top sort of key items, right, in the herb and spice space. Is there any way you can share a couple of metrics with us on maybe where you are on that process? Do you now have those at the right price points? Are you most of the way there?

And we're really pleased with the progress that we've made on our management of price points with our customers. When I talk about being at the beginning of a process here in our prepared remarks, it's really in reference to the use of the new tools that we added in the middle of third quarter. So we have a time set up and with most of our leading customers in the U.S. to work through analytics with them around both pricing and on assortment. And the 2 really need to work together. We've added new modeling tools for both pricing and assortment, they work together in tandem. And we expect to get through about 50% of the ACV of our customers by the end of the fourth quarter of this year. So that's pretty good progress. In terms of implementing what we've done so far on the price points on those key items, we've made a lot of progress. And that is part of the reason for the strength of our business. But we don't want to underestimate the value of the other things that we're doing in terms of innovation and in A&P to drive our core business. So one of the other things that you're starting to see now is innovation in the core part of our business with things like the herb grinders. You're seeing renovation of our core business to kind of take away the reason for being for some of these smaller brands that have made some inroads against us. So the kind of the extension of -- expansion of organic within our Gourmet line, the non-GMO labeling on our core spice line, these are all important consumer elements that go beyond price to get at the consumer and build the strength of our core brands. We're very committed to getting not only growing that core business but to winning market share in that business as well."

And Stubb's specifically puts us into more of a natural and interesting category. Our Stubb's business doesn't have high fructose corn syrup, it's gluten-free. And so it differentiates itself and is premium in the category. So we feel good about that. The other acquisitions that we're making, we're continuing to target are those leading companies in markets where we have either a small presence or have no presence. And so that's what we did with D&A this year. And we're also targeting more flavor acquisitions for our industrial business.

And those adjustment mechanisms have been reading through. When we first started to guide towards the upper end of that range, part of that was based on the acquisitions that we were completing during the year. So that helps us contribute about another 1% to the growth of that number. But I would also point to the fact that also the confidences is in the underlying base business, where we've seen strong organic growth pretty broad-based candidly. So that's also allowing us to feel good about the upper end of that range."

When you go back to -- I mean, when I look at below your 9% to 11% earnings growth that we've seen for the past few years, a couple of years anyway, I mean, currency has clearly played a huge role in that. And then when we go back to digging through -- you had about 3 or 4 quarters back in '08, '09, where currency just crushed you at like twice the magnitude. And the difference it seems to me is that not only you had some more acquisition tailwind back then, but you priced a lot more aggressively. And so it leaves me -- I guess, two questions. First should be, I guess, different -- what's different kind of this time? It seems like especially in overseas markets that are affected by currency, it seems like you're a little bit more shy to price to that currency and cost obviously because I know a lot of these costs wind up being denominated in something like dollars, if not explicitly dollars. And I guess secondly, when you look at that 9% to 11% earnings algorithm, it seems likes it's the right thing to do for your business to balance volume and pricing like that in the face of currency headwinds. Do you think that maybe 9% to 11% earnings-wise is -- is that a signal that maybe that's too much as far as what the core business should be able to sustain prudently? Those are my questions."

And so we've kind of taken a pause a bit on pricing. We've taken some pricing to offset currency in some of our markets. But our focus has been more on getting the right price thresholds and making sure that we're not giving consumers or customers a reason to go somewhere else. So that's really what we've seen more this year. Around the overall EPS guidance of 9% to 11%, we still feel pretty confident that over time that, that is an achievable target. Obviously, year-to-year, we have to make adjustments based on what's happening. This year, we had the particular headwinds around pension costs and around currency while we offset some commodity inflation. But we still feel over time that, that's the right targets. Remember that includes some contribution from acquisitions in the years. And this year, while we've made a couple of acquisitions, they have a minimal impact on the earnings for the year.

McCormick's third quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflect the effectiveness of our growth strategies and engagement of our employees around the world. With a mid-single-di",1048,"Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's third quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflect the effectiveness of our growth strategies and engagement of our employees around the world. With a mid-single-digit sales increase in constant currency on our base business and added momentum for our latest acquisitions, we are tracking well toward the upper end of our fiscal year 2015 sales growth targets. At the bottom line, despite some added headwinds, we still expect to deliver an increase in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year, including the impact of the unfavorable currency. 
Taking a look at the third quarter. We had a particularly strong broad-based increase at the top line, growing sales 7% in constant currency. We're driving this growth through innovation, brand marketing and the expansion of distribution in current consumer markets like Poland and Latin America and expanded support for our industrial customers as they move into new parts of Asia and the Middle East. The 3 acquisitions completed this year, the latest being Stubb's in August, are providing an added boost to McCormick's sales and will have a full impact in the fourth quarter. 
I mentioned that -- some added 2015 headwinds, and these specifically affected our third quarter profit results. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period compared to a 4% increase through the first half. Kohinoor results lowered our growth rate by 2 percentage points. I'll come back to this topic in a minute. Aside from this impact, our strong sales from the savings related to our stepped-up cost reduction programs are more than offsetting increases in material costs and employee benefit expenses. 
Moving to adjusted earnings per share. If you recall at the time of our call back in early July, we guided to a double-digit decline from the year-ago period due to a projected year-on-year increase in the tax rate resulting from the favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter of 2014. Our guidance also anticipated some added pressure from currency. Our actual results for the quarter at $0.85 of adjusted earnings per share was down about 10% from the year-ago period, right in line with our guidance. We continue to generate strong cash flow and continue to have a balanced use of cash in 2015 with similar amounts invested in the business through acquisitions and returned to McCormick shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Before I update you on our latest outlook, I want to recognize McCormick employees and our leadership team for their focus on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success. We're 1 month into our fourth quarter and have a positive view for this last and largest quarter of fiscal year 2015. Gordon is going to provide some specific financial guidance, but let me share a few remarks. 
Given our year-to-date results and momentum and the added benefit of our acquisitions, we're tracking toward the upper end of our 4% to 6% sales growth target. An important factor in this outlook is the continued strength in the category growth for spices and seasonings in the U.S. and our progress in improving our consumer business in this market. Lawrence will have more to share on this. 
We have a more conservative outlook for adjusted earnings per share than we had back in early July, reflecting the impact of Kohinoor and the recent decline in the Mexican peso, which affects income from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. We recognize our profit growth in 2015 is below our long-term target of 9% to 11%. But overall, we feel good about our performance this year and our ability to address these specific headwinds. As we shared in this morning's press release, we've raised our expected cost savings and will use this fuel for growth for more aggressive brand marketing support during the fourth quarter holiday period. 
Let's move on to my comments about Kohinoor. As many of you recall, in 2011, McCormick purchased a majority interest in India, entering the basmati rice business with a strong category share, well-established and extensive route to market and a great brand name. Our intent was to continue to drive the growth of basmati rice sales in India and use this business as a springboard into other branded products, such as seasoned rice mixes and herbs and spices. Since 2011, we've built a capable leadership team, increased our distribution and introduced several new products. 
However, certain parts of this business have led to underperformance. We recently made a decision to exit certain low-margin product lines and bring greater focus to higher-margin items and our expansion plans. This decision triggered a noncash impairment charge and some additional costs recorded in the third quarter that Gordon will discuss. We continue to regard India as a compelling long-term growth market for McCormick. With this action, we expect to improve our Kohinoor business and with our other 2 joint ventures, more fully participate in the enormous growth potential in this market. 
Let me circle back with a remark about our stepped-up cost reduction programs. Across functions and in countries around the world, McCormick employees are working to lower costs. And we've added leadership resources behind this effort. We now expect to deliver at least $75 million from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program. This is an increase of $10 million from our initial guidance. Together with $20 million of projected savings from our streamlining actions, we now anticipate total cost savings of at least $95 million in 2015. This is a significant increase from last year's record $69 million in annual cost savings. 
Before I turn it over to Lawrence, I want to point to the strong momentum underway as we head into the fourth quarter and our 2016 fiscal year. My enthusiasm and confidence in this business starts with our advantaged categories and engaged employees. Our products are on trend with today's consumer. Across nearly all of our markets, people are exploring new flavors, seeking fresh, simple ingredients, focused on source and quality and working to improve their wellness. Keep these trends in mind as Lawrence provides a business update, and you'll see how they continue to shape our growth strategies, including innovation, brand positioning and acquisitions. 
I'll turn it over to Lawrence."
181176,311621712,874141,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 01, 2015",2015-10-01,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Consumer trends are indeed setting our direction for both of our segments, consumer and industrial. Investors continued to be interested in progress with our U.S. consumer business.

Investors continued to be interested in progress with our U.S. consumer business. That will be the focus of my initial remarks, and then I'll move on to several other key consumer markets, followed by an update on McCormick's industrial business. 
For our U.S. consumer business, we have had actions underway to improve this business for nearly 2 years now that include accelerating innovation, building our brand equity and winning at retail. Our quarterly business results in 2015 are showing steady progress with these actions. Our largest category, spices and seasonings, remained strong with consumption up 5% during the third quarter. This same data indicates we grew consumption of McCormick brand spices and seasonings 2% this period, which is a sequential improvement from a 1% increase in the second quarter. We will continue to work toward a growth rate that is at parity with the category. 
Within this broader category, we are particularly pleased with the performance of our Gourmet line. Relaunched about 6 months ago, consumption results for the fourth quarter show a 4% increase, maintaining the strong pace we set last quarter. For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we achieved a 23rd consecutive month of share gain driven by innovation and effective marketing for both new products and core items. Our liquid McCormick Skillet Sauces in the market for a year now have reached a category share of 10% and continued to grow. During this period, we also had standout sales results with Zatarain's, Grill Mates and Kitchen Basics. 
On the innovation front, we discussed most of our new second quarter products back in the July call, including additional varieties of gluten-free recipe mixes, new slow cooker Skillet Sauces and Kitchen Basics stock cubes. Our latest breakthrough innovation is herb grinders, which are just starting to appear on retail shelves. Herb grinders conveniently deliver the flavor and aroma of fresh herbs. The herbs are in larger pieces and gently dried through a proprietary process that protects color and flavor. We're excited about the results of this product in consumer testing. 2/3 of consumers use the grinder every 3 days both before and during meal preparation as well as at the table. As you can appreciate, we've created a significant opportunity to convert consumers that currently purchase packaged fresh herbs to our new Grinders. 
In building brand equity, our 2015 emphasis has been on easy ways to prepare healthy meals, new product news and freshness and purity. You'll be hearing a lot of from us this quarter as brand marketing increases nearly 10% as planned across all markets with a portion here in the U.S. to support a new purity campaign. We're introducing a distinct consumer-facing message on freshness and purity, one that lets consumers know that McCormick purchases the best spices and herbs from around the world. We know the origin and we control the quality. In a recent large industry recall of ground cumin, we were able to reassure consumers of the purity of McCormick's cumin. 
We also have additional news on wellness as it relates to our products. Last quarter, we shared with you that the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended to the federal government that the 2015 Dietary Guidelines encourage the use of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. This summer, the USDA issued a recommendation to school nutritionists to use herbs and spices for more appealing taste and as a way to reduce sodium. In fact, the new tagline of their program is Spice It Up. Also for people 65 and older, the USDA recommended using spices and herbs to compensate for changes in the sense of smell and taste. 
Wellness is top of mind for a lot of consumers these days and many of them are equating this with certain attributes, like gluten-free, non-GMO and organic. To continue to shape our product portfolio for the evolving consumer, we recently committed to labeling more than 70% of our McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts in the U.S. non-GMO within 1 year. Appearing on retail shelves right now is our first product to carry the non-GMO designation, McCormick brand vanilla extract. In addition, by the end of 2016, 80% of our Gourmet line will be organic, up from 10% today. This news is being well received by our consumers. We're eager to get these products in front of consumers and are continuing to evaluate related initiatives in the U.S. and other markets. 
In addition to high-impact brand marketing messages, we need an effective means of delivery, which includes digital marketing. McCormick is not alone in this shift toward digital marketing as a better way to reach consumers and to achieve a higher ROI on our spending. In 2015, we're planning for digital marketing to reach 1/3 of our global advertising, up from 11% in 2010. We've put a lot of effort and resources into staying at the forefront of digital and e-commerce and these investments are paying off. I'm proud to share that McCormick ranked #5 out of 114 food brands in the U.S. market on L2's latest Digital IQ Index. This firm scores companies on several key factors, including digital marketing presence and social media community size, content and engagement. The Digital IQ Index also considers e-commerce effectiveness. For the e-commerce channel, we're equally proud of the recent award from Amazon, which named McCormick supplier of the year for grocery. 
Just as important, if not more so, are our efforts and resources devoted to partnering with our retail customers. Slide 15 shows a time line of activity that has been underway for about 2 years now and leading up to our latest investment in category management tools and resources. Compared to last year, we have increased this investment fivefold, focusing on price modeling and assortment optimization across our top categories. This quarter, with an expanded team, we're mobilizing our insights and tools to optimize sales and profit for us and for our customers. We are in the very early stages of this activity and just beginning to share insights with retail customers. I'm excited about the potential for these new tools and customer discussions as we head into 2016. 
Another area of investor interest has been our consumer business in China. We continue to achieve double-digit constant currency sales growth in this market in contrast to some other consumer products companies. Given the broader impact of the economy on consumer retail purchases, to date, our business had seen less of an impact and our leadership in China is cautiously optimistic. In our top 3 categories, average spend per household has continued to grow and McCormick is gaining share through brand marketing, in-store execution and continued geographic expansion, including cross-selling of our McCormick brand in Central China following the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments. 
Moving to our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA. We had strong 18% constant currency sales growth in the third quarter despite some challenging retail environments, especially in the U.K. We achieved increases in both the U.K. and France with a significant increase in brand marketing and from innovation, including grilling products and Vahiné brand dessert items. In both Poland and Russia, the big driver has been expanded distribution, including with new retailers. And our acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari gave a further boost to sales, adding 11 percentage points of our increase. 
Turning now to our industrial business. I'm going to start as I did last quarter with our results in EMEA. The third quarter of 2015 marked another period of outstanding sales growth as our team in this market is winning on all fronts, particularly with quick service restaurants. We're winning with product innovation, distribution gains and supporting the geographic expansion of these customers. Likewise, we're expanding into new markets, along with the food manufacturers we supply, including the new facility we have under construction in the Middle East.  
In the Americas region, we had a solid performance but mixed results. The growth this quarter came from pricing, our Brand Aromatics acquisition and sales from our operation in Mexico. However, these gains were partially offset by lower sales to quick service restaurant customers that are working through a period of weak consumer demand in the U.S. We're partnering with these customers on ways for them to drive their sales growth and are also selectively building relationships with other food service customers in the U.S. In our Asia/Pacific region, we had a strong increase in new industrial products shipped from our operation in Australia. In China, the recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants has continued from the year-ago period when these customers were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding a quality issue from a supplier of protein. 
To wrap up my remarks, employees and business leaders throughout the company are driving our success. We have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter and beyond with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for a better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. 
Thank you. And it's my pleasure to turn it over now to Gordon."

As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we had some very strong performance in parts of our business along with significant headwinds. Aside from the Kohinoor performance, our overall results were generally in line with the guidance we shared with you back in June. Let's start with a closer look at McCormick's third quarter sales and profit, followed by comments on our cash flow and balance sheet, and then the details of our latest guidance. On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step-up from what we have seen year-to-date with a 7% increase that included 2 percentage points from our acquisitions. 
Taking a look at our consumer business. Slide 21 shows that we grew third quarter consumer business sales 7% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix for our base business as well as a full quarter of sales from the Drogheria & Alimentari acquisition and about 2 weeks of Stubb's. We grew sales in the Americas with our largest increases in recipe mixes, Grill Mates, Kitchen Basics and Zatarain's in the U.S. Product innovation and brand marketing support, particularly in digital as Lawrence described, are driving these results. We are pleased with our progress based on the latest consumption data. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America had another quarter of double-digit sales growth as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. 
In EMEA, we continued to achieve strong sales performance and had the added benefit of D&A sales this quarter. The core business growth was broad-based with increases in each of our top markets, driven by our higher brand marketing, our new product innovation and expanded distribution. In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region at a double-digit rate in both China and Australia again this quarter. In China, sales of bullion products were particularly strong. In India, lower pricing more than offset a slight increase in volume and product mix. 
For the consumer business in total, our third quarter adjusted operating income was down from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income declined 3% from the year-ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense. In addition, operating income from Kohinoor was down $3 million from the third quarter of 2014. 
Turning to our industrial business. We grew third quarter sales a robust 8% in constant currency from the year-ago period. This increase was led by higher volume and product mix, followed by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and by sales of Brand Aromatics that we acquired earlier this year. 
As shown on Slide 27, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 2.5 percentage points to our growth in the Americas. We also had higher pricing for a total sales increase of 5% in constant currency. In the third quarter, strong sales from our operation in Mexico were largely offset by continued weakness in U.S. sales to quick service restaurant customers. 
Our industrial business in EMEA continues to post impressive growth with sales this period up 15% in constant currency. Higher volume, along with our CCI actions, is driving greater profitability for this business, too. As we indicated, this is the third year of exceptional performance as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. 
We grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 12% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial business rose 5% from the third quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth reached 12% with the benefit of higher sales and our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and increased employee benefit expense. 
Let's turn to Slide 31. While adjusted operating income, excluding special charges, declined 4%, if we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, our third quarter result was up slightly from the year-ago period. This is despite the $3 million decline in Kohinoor profit. Gross profit margin declined 50 basis points. Included in this result is the impact of Kohinoor, which lowered the gross profit margin by 54 basis points. So we are seeing an underlying sequential improvement from the first half of 2015 as the benefit of our cost savings actions build and pricing actions are implemented. The 54 basis point reduction to gross profit from Kohinoor was comprised of $3 million of special charges included in cost of goods sold, which represents an inventory write-down directly related to the decision to discontinue the sales of certain lower-margin product lines, along with a $2 million year-on-year decline in Kohinoor's gross profit prior to that special charge. Even with this third quarter result, we still expect our fiscal year 2015 gross profit margin to be comparable to 2014. 
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense rose 60 basis points due in part to increased employee benefit expense. In addition to higher retirement benefit expense, there were increases in incentive compensation for those parts of the business performing ahead of plan. Also the percentage increase in brand marketing this period at 5% or $2 million exceeded our rate of sales growth this quarter. As described in this morning's press release, there were 3 components to the special charges we recorded in the third quarter: $10 million for the noncash impairment of the Kohinoor brand name; $3 million for special charges in cost of goods sold, as I just described; and $2 million of charges that related to previously announced streamlining actions in EMEA and North America. For the fiscal year, we now estimate total charges of $65 million. This assumes $2 million of additional charges in the fourth quarter. 
Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 30%, an increase from 21% in the third quarter of 2014, which was the primary reason why we guided to a double-digit year-on-year decline in adjusted earnings per share this period. If you recall, in the third quarter of 2014, we had a significant favorable impact from discrete tax items. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter of 2015 based on our current outlook. 
Income from unconsolidated operations rose this quarter. This increase was largely the net result of 3 factors: underlying growth in our unconsolidated income led by our joint venture in Mexico; the unfavorable impact of a dramatic decline in the Mexican peso; and a favorable $2 million impact related to an allocation of the $13 million in special charges to Kohinoor's minority interest. As a result of the increased weakness of the Mexican peso, we now anticipate our income from unconsolidated operations for the fiscal year to be up slightly versus our previous estimate of at least 10%. At the bottom line, third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85. As you can see on Slide 34, this was a $0.10 decline from the year-ago period due in large part to the tax rate and adjusted operating income. 
Turning next to Slide 35. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations was $317 million compared to $276 million in the year-ago period. This year, we have returned $226 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and expect to be back in the market for share repurchases this quarter. We used $211 million of cash and short-term borrowings for our 3 acquisitions and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was at 2.0 at quarter end, slightly above our target of 1.5 to 1.8. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. 
I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. Alan already provided perspective on this, so let me quickly run through the numbers. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales in constant currency at the upper end of a 4% to 6% range. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 percentage point to this increase, and we continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015. We now expect to be at the lower end of a 6% to 7% constant currency growth rate for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million. We now anticipate that unfavorable currency rates will reduce operating income growth by 4 percentage points, up from 3 percentage points.
For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 7% to 8% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $65 million estimated impact from special charges, up from our prior estimate of $54 million with the increase due to the third quarter charges. We also expect to be at the lower end of $3.47 to $3.54 in adjusted earnings per share. This range assumes a $0.13 unfavorable impact on operating income from currency. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.18, including a $0.36 impact from special charges. For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This is providing funds for our dividend payments, our acquisition activity, debt paydown and share repurchase activity. 
Let's turn now to your questions, and then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

In terms of implementing what we've done so far on the price points on those key items, we've made a lot of progress. And that is part of the reason for the strength of our business. But we don't want to underestimate the value of the other things that we're doing in terms of innovation and in A&P to drive our core business. So one of the other things that you're starting to see now is innovation in the core part of our business with things like the herb grinders. You're seeing renovation of our core business to kind of take away the reason for being for some of these smaller brands that have made some inroads against us. So the kind of the extension of -- expansion of organic within our Gourmet line, the non-GMO labeling on our core spice line, these are all important consumer elements that go beyond price to get at the consumer and build the strength of our core brands. We're very committed to getting not only growing that core business but to winning market share in that business as well."

And Stubb's specifically puts us into more of a natural and interesting category. Our Stubb's business doesn't have high fructose corn syrup, it's gluten-free. And so it differentiates itself and is premium in the category. So we feel good about that. The other acquisitions that we're making and continuing to target are those leading companies in markets where we have either a small presence or no presence. And so that's what we did with D&A this year. And we're also targeting more flavor acquisitions for our industrial business. So while we've done very few over the last 10 years, we see that as an opportunity to really build and grow our business.

When you go back to -- I mean, when I look at below your 9% to 11% earnings growth that we've seen for the past few years, a couple of years anyway, I mean, currency has clearly played a huge role in that. And then when we go back to digging through -- you had about 3 or 4 quarters back in '08, '09, where currency just crushed you at like twice the magnitude. And the difference it seems to me is that not only you had some more acquisition tailwind back then, but you priced a lot more aggressively. And so it leads me -- I guess, two questions. First should be, I guess, different -- what's different kind of this time? It seems like especially in overseas markets that are affected by currency, it seems like you're a little bit more shy to price to that currency and cost obviously because I know a lot of these costs wind up being denominated in something like dollars, if not explicitly dollars. And I guess secondly, when you look at that 9% to 11% earnings algorithm, it seems like it's the right thing to do for your business to balance volume and pricing like that in the face of currency headwinds. Do you think that maybe 9% to 11% earnings-wise is -- is that a signal that maybe that's too much as far as what the core business should be able to sustain prudently? Those are my questions."

But specifically to pricing, what we saw in 2009, '10 and '11 and '12 was extreme commodity inflation. And so we were trying to respond to that.

And so we've kind of taken a pause a bit on pricing. We've taken some pricing to offset currency in some of our markets. But our focus has been more on getting the right price thresholds and making sure that we're not giving consumers or customers a reason to go somewhere else. So that's really what we've seen more this year. Around the overall EPS guidance of 9% to 11%, we still feel pretty confident that over time that, that is an achievable target. Obviously, year-to-year, we have to make adjustments based on what's happening. This year, we had the particular headwinds around pension costs and around currency while we offset some commodity inflation. But we still feel over time that, that's the right targets. Remember that includes some contribution from acquisitions in the years. And this year, while we've made a couple of acquisitions, they have a minimal impact on the earnings for the year.

And we did have a share gain on recipe mixes, our second core category, during the quarter. And I think in our remarks, we said we've had 23 consecutive months now of share gains in that category."

So for instance, one of our customers launched all-day breakfast. We have very little that goes in there for that customer. So even if they're doing a little better, it doesn't impact us. We tend to be in the U.S. on the core menu items and outside the U.S., more on the product innovation and limited time offers, which is why we're seeing a little bit of a disparity in the results."

And so the $95 million is obviously for this fiscal year. But does the fact that it's kind of ramping up -- I think there was a previous question in this regard. Does the fact that it's ramping up as the year progresses suggests that fiscal '16 can also be quite a good year? And then kind of related to that, Alan, maybe I'm crazy, but did you mention earlier in the year about certain level of SG&A savings into fiscal '16? And how does kind of CCI figure into that if my memory is correct?"

And you alluded to the SG&A, which indeed we talked about 100 basis point improvement. So some of that started this year, but there'll be the full year benefit going into next year because some of the actions that we took and announced this year only had a partial year impact. So you certainly have that wraparound benefit. And then there are the programs within the year that kind of go into the base, and then we start all over again next year, and there's a new hill to climb. And our teams every year find a way. And to Mike's earlier comments, they find a way to get the savings targets that we need. So we're still developing what those programs are for next year. But certainly, there's going to be wraparound from the actions we've taken this year."
