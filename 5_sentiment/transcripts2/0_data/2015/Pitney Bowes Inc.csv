By now, I hope you had a chance to review the press release announcing our full year and fourth quarter financial results and our guidance for 2015. We are very pleased with our results for all of 2014, includ",722,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. By now, I hope you had a chance to review the press release announcing our full year and fourth quarter financial results and our guidance for 2015. 
We are very pleased with our results for all of 2014, including our fourth quarter performance. We did a good job navigating a fairly turbulent macroeconomic environment. The fourth quarter clearly demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model, our strong market position and our strong offerings. Mike will provide an overview of our fourth quarter, full year and our 2015 guidance. I'm going to provide perspective on our overall transformation. 
Bottom line, we've made tremendous progress against our 3 strategic initiatives to transform our company and unlock shareholder value. Just to remind everyone, our 3 strategic initiatives are: number one, stabilize our mail businesses; number two, drive operational excellence; and finally, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. 
Let me take you to those initiatives in order. First, stabilizing the Mail business. Over the last 2 years, we have taken steps to reengineer our go-to-market model moving to sales techniques, which are much more scalable, including telesales and the web. These initiatives are providing the benefits of providing better client service and are substantially more efficient. This transition is complete in North America and underway in Europe. 
In the second quarter, we pointed to some disruption in our North American business as we changed our coverage model. We continue to have some descriptions in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we saw improvements from the trends in the second and third quarter, and we continue to expect improvement going forward. 
We're in the process of executing these go-to-market changes in Europe, and we expect to continue to execute these changes on a country-by-country basis throughout Europe. Again, we are confident that these go-to-market changes will provide better client service and be dramatically more efficient. 
Second, operational excellence. In May of 2013, we committed to reduce our going rate expense as we entered into 2015 by $100 million to $125 million. We've done that, and we did that while we have made substantial investments in our future, investments in our systems, our brand and importantly, our products. 
We've made substantial progress reducing our DSO and our inventory levels. Our inventory levels are about half what they were only 2 years ago. 
We committed to investment-grade ratios. To that end, we have both retired and refinanced debt. We have fine-tuned our geographic footprint and our product portfolio, focusing on specific markets and partnering in other geographic markets where we have competitive advantage and importantly, make good returns. 
And finally, in January this year, we relaunched our brand supported by a new website. This was much more than putting a fresh coat of paint on an old car. The brand reflects our company's unique position in the physical and digital world. The net impact of all these changes is an increase in our EBIT margins, a strong balance sheet and a company well positioned for the future. 
Finally, our last initiative, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. In May of 2013, we identified a series of digital markets that, in aggregate, represented close to $30 billion of opportunity growing at a double-digit rate. We said it was our objective to lead in those markets and grow at double-digits rates. 
To many of you, it probably seems as an aspiration, given that businesses have not grown in several years. In 2014, those businesses grew over 20% and now represent more than 20% of our portfolio. Good progress from a standing start 2 years ago, but we've just scratching the surface. 
Bottom line, Pitney Bowes is a different company today than it was 2 years ago. We committed to a strategic plan, laid out markers, and we have executed. That said, quarter-to-quarter, there may be factors like changes in go-to-market or currency fluctuations that affect results, but our strategy is aimed at delivering shareholder value over the long term. Much more to do, and we're in the middle of a multiyear transformation, but we have created substantial value, and we have more in our site. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike to give you the specifics on the fourth quarter and the year."

As Marc mentioned, we're very pleased with our full year results as we achieved our annual guidance targets for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. For the full year, excluding the impact of the di",3350,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As Marc mentioned, we're very pleased with our full year results as we achieved our annual guidance targets for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. 
For the full year, excluding the impact of the divested revenues in Europe, revenue grew 2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.90, and free cash flow was $571 million. 
We were able to achieve our annual guidance targets on strong Digital Commerce Solutions and Presort Services revenue growth and the benefits of our operational excellence cost initiatives. We achieved these results despite changes to our SMB portfolio and sales force, a challenging year-over-year comparison in our Production Mail business and a strengthening U.S. dollar, particularly in the latter part of the year. 
We worked through these challenges. We stayed focused and even expanded our cost-reduction initiatives. We continue to optimize our business portfolio by also investing in our growth initiatives, a new ERP system and a new brand. 
We also continue to effectively implement our capital allocation strategy and returned value to our shareholders through a competitive dividend and a $50 million share repurchase. Our actions throughout the years support our multiyear strategy to stabilize our Mailing business, achieve operational excellence and invest for growth. 
I will update you first on how the actions we have taken positively impact our fourth quarter results and discuss later how we expect these actions to impact our 2015 and midterm financial results. 
Turning to the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $984 million compared to the prior year. Revenue declined less than 1% on a constant-currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. 
Despite the headline reported revenue decline, our underlying operational performance was solid. As we noted last quarter, we exited a noncore product line in Norway and transitioned to a dealer sales network for 6 smaller markets in Europe. The divested revenues associated with these actions were approximately $12 million and were not restated as a discontinued operation. 
Adjusting for these divested revenues and the impact of currencies, which was about $20 million, our underlying operations grew 1%. This is in line with our overall results for the year. 
During the quarter, the growth rates for each of the 3 segment groups continue to progress towards our longer-term expectations as outlined at our Analyst Day in May. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 13% in Digital Commerce Solutions and declined 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions. 
SMB Solutions revenue declined 5% on a constant-currency basis, but declined only 3% when also adjusted for the divested revenues. For SMB, this is an improvement in trend and a solid progress in our stabilization efforts. 
We also continue to reduce SG&A expenses versus prior year as a result of the ongoing implementation of our go-to-market strategy as well as other cost-reduction initiatives throughout the business. We achieved a reduction in SG&A despite increased investment in our new ERP system, increased investment in marketing in support of the new brand and the investment in growth initiatives. 
We have reduced the baseline SG&A by $136 million. This exceeds our original cost savings target of $100 million to $125 million, and we're not done yet. 
We have identified and recorded restructuring costs in the fourth quarter for an expanded set of initiatives that are expected to add an additional $30 million to $40 million of annualized benefits, principally in 2015. More on that later. 
The revenue results and reduced costs are reflected in our adjusted EBIT dollar and margin growth versus prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.51 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Currency had a $0.01 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter, and prior year results included a tax benefit of $0.04 per share. 
Adjusting for these factors, for comparative purposes, adjusted EPS grew 11% in the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.29, which included a restructuring charge of $0.22 per share associated with an expansion of our previously announced cost-reduction plan. 
GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.31, which included income of $0.02 per share from discontinued operations. Free cash flow during the quarter was $154 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $258 million in cash from operations. 
In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was primarily impacted by the timing of tax payments, the timing of working capital requirements and higher capital expenditures related to our ERP implementation. 
During the quarter, we used $38 million of cash to return capital to our common shareholders in the form of dividend, and we made $14 million in restructuring payments. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $100 million share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to the income statement. Please note that all income statement related results are on an adjusted basis. A reconciliation of adjusted to recorded financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $201 million this quarter, which was $13 million or 7% higher than prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 20.4%, which was an increase of 180 basis points over prior year. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $255 million. SG&A for the quarter was $347 million or $15 million less than in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 35.3%, which was an improvement of 50 basis points. 
As I mentioned earlier, we achieved this despite the incremental expense related to the new ERP implementation. Excluding the ERP expense, SG&A would have been 34.5% of revenue this quarter or 110 basis points improvement. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $62 million for actions associated with our previously announced plans to reduce costs. While we are taking a number of actions across our business, a significant portion of these charges relate to our decision to accelerate our go-to-market strategy in Europe. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $42 million, which was a decline of about $2.5 million when compared to the prior year. This is the result of actions we have taken to reduce and manage our debt over the last year. 
Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.27%, which was about 13 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate and adjusted earnings for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 25% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Last year's lower tax rate resulted from our favorable resolution of certain tax matters that resulted in a benefit to the income statement in the quarter. 
Turning to our financial performance for the full year. As I noted earlier, our results are consistent with our annual guidance. For the full year, revenue totaled $3.8 billion, which was growth of 1% when compared to prior year on both a constant currency and reported basis. 
For comparative purposes, if we adjust the results for the impact of the actions we took in Europe earlier in the year, revenue would have grown 2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the full year was $1.90. Currency had about a $0.02 per share negative impact on earnings for the year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.47, which included a restructuring charge of $0.29 per share for the year, income of $0.05 per share related to the company's divestiture of an investment in the third quarter and $0.19 per share of debt extinguishment costs from the first quarter. 
GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.64, which includes income of $0.17 per share from discontinued operations. Free cash flow for the full year was $571 million, which is at the high end of our guidance range. 
On a GAAP basis, we generated $656 million in cash from operations. Overall, cash flow was impacted by our incremental CapEx investment in our new ERP system, lower finance receivables and the timing of tax payments. 
During the year, we used our cash flow to return $152 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends. We paid down $100 million of debt, made $56 million in restructuring payments, bought back $50 million of our stock and invested in the business. 
Looking at balance sheet at year-end. We had $3.3 billion of debt on the balance sheet, which was $94 million less than prior year. The company ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash on hand. 
Also, stockholders' equity was reduced by $128 million from prior year. This was primarily due to the remeasurement of the company's pension and post-retirement obligation, which incorporated the decline in discount rates and the adoption of new mortality assumptions. 
Now I'd like to discuss the fourth quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $376 million, and EBIT was $166 million. When compared to the prior year, revenue declined 4.2% on a reported basis and 3.6% on a constant-currency basis. 
We expect this positive momentum to continue as the new go-to-market efforts mature. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvements in the company's expanded inside sales organization, and as a result, revenue declined at a lesser rate than in the second and third quarters. 
The direct sales organization delivered higher productivity, which resulted in an increased average order value. Recurring revenue streams also continued to stabilize due to a further moderation in the decline of financing and rentals revenue. 
EBIT margin was 44%, which was a decline of 80 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business and fewer lease extensions than the prior year. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $134 million, and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant-currency basis and 15% on a reported basis. Revenue declined just 2%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. 
These results are in line with recent trends and the company's efforts to stabilize overall mail-related revenue. We were able to achieve these results despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe. 
Also excluding the impact of the divested revenues and currency, supplies revenue continue to grow, which was offset by a moderate decline in equipment sales. EBIT margin was 16%, which was an improvement of 430 basis points versus the prior year due to the benefits from changes in go-to-market, including the shift in strategy for smaller markets and limited moves of client accounts to inside sales in major European markets during the quarter. 
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions Group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $132 million, and EBIT was $20 million. Revenue declined 10% on a constant-currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. 
Revenue comparisons for the quarter were impacted by fewer large multiunit inserting and production print equipment installations than in the prior year. EBIT margin was 14.9%, which was an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the higher mix of inserting business, improved margin on service revenue and ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $117 million, and EBIT was $30 million. Revenue grew 9% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the improved qualification of mail for presort discounts as a result of operational efficiencies, an increase in the volume of first-class mail processed and the effective implementation of postal rate and rule changes at the beginning of 2014. EBIT margin was 25.6%, which was an improvement of 870 basis points versus the prior year due to the revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity. 
For the Digital Commerce Solutions segment, revenue was $225 million, and EBIT was $32 million. Revenue grew 13% on a constant-currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. 
The segment again experienced revenue growth in each of its 4 product categories: Ecommerce, Software, Shipping and Marketing Services. Ecommerce growth was driven by strong increases in the number of packages shipped and benefited from the initial ramp up of the U.K. outbound cross-border services. However, the strengthening U.S. dollar had a dampening effect on the rate of increase in the number of purchases from the U.S. over the course of the quarter. 
Software revenue growth was led by a significant increase in licensing revenue, particularly enterprise Location Intelligence Software, reflecting the success from our ongoing investment in product and channel specialization. 
Revenue growth in the areas of shipping solutions and Marketing Services resulted from new client acquisitions for their respective product offerings. 
EBIT margin was 14.1%, which was improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. The EBIT margin improvement reflects the benefit of earnings leverage from revenue growth, net of the impact of our continued investments in technology and infrastructure across the Digital Commerce portfolio. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter and year. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company. 
2015 represents a critical third year in our journey. It is a peak year for investment as we complete our major go-to-market initiatives, the build-out of our ERP program and invest in brands and marketing to build greater awareness of our unique capabilities. 
To better reflect the leverage that these activities will deliver, we are providing guidance for 2015 as well as some insights on how our strategic initiatives and operational excellence programs will impact future results. As in the past, we are providing guidance on a constant-currency basis. As we have seen in recent months, currency exchange rates are subject to substantial movement over time. Therefore, reported results may vary materially from a constant-currency view. The guidance provided here assumes that the global economy and foreign exchange markets will not change significantly from current levels. 
For 2015, revenue excluding the impact from currency is expected to be in a range of flat to 3% growth when compared to 2014. It is important to note that on a full year basis, 2014 included about $30 million of revenue related to our noncore product lines that we exited in Norway and 6 smaller European markets that we transitioned to a dealer sales network. 
The impact to revenue comparisons reflected in our guidance for 2015 is that 1% of lower revenue growth. To give you a sense of the impact of currency volatility on reported revenue, current exchange rates would result in reported revenue for 2015 being more than 3 percentage points lower than our constant-currency range. 
From a sensitivity perspective, each 5% movement in the exchange rates material to our business would result in about 150 basis points change in reported revenue growth rate. The composition of our revenue growth is expected to be broadly consistent with the market growth rates for our business segments as presented at Analyst Day last May. 
For the year, we expect double-digit revenue growth in the Digital Commerce Solutions segment as we continue to expand our ecommerce offerings and drive continued growth in our Software, Shipping and Marketing Services businesses. We expect flat to modest revenue growth in the enterprise solutions group from continued growth in our Presort Services operation, driven by additional new clients and higher processed mail volume. This growth maybe partially offset by headwinds in our Production Mail business, resulting from the uncertain European economy as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. 
We expect a low single-digit decline in revenue in the SMB Solutions Group as trends continue to improve and stabilize in our North American Mailing business. We expect improved productivity from changes in our sales force. 
However, as we implement the strategy in other global markets in 2015, it may impact local results in the short term. 
Turning to our EPS guidance. To provide a clearer picture of the expected underlying performance of the business in 2015 compared to 2014, we provided a table on Slide 29 of our fourth quarter earnings slides presentation, which can be found in our Investor Relations website. 
To begin, adjusted EPS in 2014 of $1.90 included a onetime tax benefit of $0.08 per share that is not expected to be repeated in 2015. That provides a baseline of $1.82 per share in 2014 for comparative purposes. 
Our GAAP EPS from continuing operations for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $2. This reflects the benefits of growth in our business as well as substantial benefits from our operational excellence initiatives. These benefits will be partially offset by incremental investments versus 2014 specifically related to our ERP program and a higher ongoing spend on our brand and marketing activities. 
These incremental expenses, in aggregate, are expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share in 2015. When adding back the incremental ERP investment of $0.07 to $0.09 per share to our GAAP EPS guidance range for 2015, the underlying operations reflecting earnings growth range of 5% to 15% when compared to the $1.82 comparative EPS in 2014. 
Please note we expect the costs associated with our ERP implementation and marketing efforts to be higher in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. ERP spend reflects the resources for development, testing and data conversion, and in the case of marketing expense, this is related to brand launch and awareness building activity. 
The company expects a tax rate in the range of 31% to 34% for 2015. This range is compared to a 2014 tax rate on adjusted earnings of 27.7%, which included onetime benefits that are not expected to repeat in 2015. 
The higher range in 2015 reflects the changes in our portfolio as well as having closed prior year open tax audits that have given rise to tax benefits over the last few years. Free cash flow for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $550 million. This guidance assumes free cash flow will be primarily earnings driven in 2015. 
In addition, we expect our SMB finance receivables portfolio will continue to stabilize. This also assumes CapEx spending will be similar to 2014 and in the range of $170 million to $190 million, including ERP investment. 
As I noted earlier, we are providing some insight with regard to our future results to highlight the leverage that our business transformations is expected to provide over the next 3 to 5 years. Over the next several years, we expect to further realize the benefits from the investments we made in 2014 and 2015. 
This includes benefits from fully implementing our go-to-market strategy globally. In addition, we begin to get benefits from the incremental investments associated with our brand, marketing and web efforts, which we expect to be part of our expense base in the future. 
We also expect our 2016 results will benefit as we begin to reduce our investment in ERP and fully realize the $30 million to $40 million of reduced cost that I noted earlier. 
In addition, we expect incremental earnings from growth in revenue and operational leverage. Further, we expect the implementation of our ERP system globally to occur principally in 2016. Therefore, as previously discussed, we expect to realize substantial savings in 2017 and beyond as part of the plan we announced at our May 2014 Analyst Day meeting. 
In summary, during a complex transformation of the company, there are many moving parts, but the takeaway from our outlook is clear. We are investing and involving our portfolio to drive sustainable growth and doing so while relentlessly driving improvement in efficiencies in our client-facing and back-office processes. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

It is as you pointed to, Shannon, affected by exchange rates. I mean, so if you think of the preponderance of that business, that's U.S. outbound. So when exchange rates begin to fluctuate, that has the obvious impact of increasing the price of goods, and what we saw in the fourth quarter is those businesses in particular are susceptible to those types of currency fluctuations. And if you unlayer it even more, you will get claims like U.S. to Russia where there was fairly dramatic currency impacts. I mean, those claims were commensurately affected. So no, on balance, I would say the business continues to scale nicely. It didn't scale in the fourth quarter the way that it had the previous quarters.

If you look at the underlying SMB equipment revenue, the other thing I should say in the consolidated is the comparison for the product line and the markets we exited in Europe. So again sort of equalizing for those, the underlying SMB business improved over the last couple of quarters.

We haven't talked a lot about Software, and we have experienced a fairly substantial change in our go-to-market there with a much more specialized sales force. If you look at the measure that we're staring at in Software besides license revenue growth, which I would point to as really a strong marker for the quarter, if you look at our yield rate on deals kind of our pipeline, our yield rate on the pipeline in the fourth quarter was almost 10 points above what it was the previous year. So that's the speaks to the impact of specialization as it relates to Software in particular. With this SMB, there's really couple of different ways that we look at it. The first and obvious is kind of SG&A as a percent of revenue. So obviously, we're doing I would say more, but we are doing with a lot less people a similar revenue trajectory if I could say it that way with what we've experienced so far is better client service. And if you were to point to the U.S. PS market share data, at least stable share, if not up a tick. So we look at a bunch of different metrics as it relates to the productivity of our sales force, and we obviously, get it down to our salesman level what they're going to do on a daily basis so that we have great tools that we are I would say early innings on between Salesforce.com any few other kind of adjacent tools that are launching productivity that are very granular level, and we're looking at it at a salesman basis and I mean, almost on a daily basis."

By now, I hope you had a chance to review the press release announcing our full year and fourth quarter financial results and our guidance for 2015. 
We are very pleased with our results for all of 2014, including our fourth quarter performance. We did a good job navigating a fairly turbulent macroeconomic environment. The fourth quarter clearly demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model, our strong market positions and our strong offerings. Mike will provide an overview of our fourth quarter, full year and our 2015 guidance. I'm going to provide perspective and our overall transformation. 
Bottom line, we've made tremendous progress against our 3 strategic initiatives to transform our company and unlock shareholder value. Just to remind everyone, our 3 strategic initiatives are: number one, stabilize our mail businesses; number two, drive operational excellence; and finally, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. 
Let me take you to those initiatives in order. First, stabilizing the mail business. Over the last 2 years, we have taken steps to reengineer our go-to-market model moving to sales techniques, which are much more scalable, including telesales and the web. These initiatives are providing the benefits of providing better client service and are substantially more efficient. This transition is complete in North America and underway in Europe. 
In the second quarter, we pointed to some disruption in our North American business as we changed our coverage model. We continue to have some disruptions in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we saw improvements from the trends in the second and third quarter, and we continue to expect improvement going forward. We're in the process of executing these go-to-market changes in Europe, and we expect to continue to execute these changes on a country-by-country basis throughout Europe. Again, we are confident that these go-to-market changes will provide better client service and be dramatically more efficient. 
Second, operational excellence. In May of 2013, we committed to reduce our going rate expense as we entered into 2015 by $100 million to $125 million. We've done that, and we did that while we have made substantial investments in our future, investments in our systems, our brand and importantly, our products. We've made substantial progress reducing our DSO and our inventory levels. Our inventory levels are about half what they were only 2 years ago. 
We committed to investment-grade ratios. To that end, we have both retired and refinanced debt. We have fine-tuned our geographic footprint and our product portfolio, focusing on specific markets and partnering in other geographic markets where we have competitive advantage and importantly, make good returns. 
And finally, in January this year, we relaunched our brand supported by a new website. This was much more than putting a fresh coat of paint on an old car. The brand reflects our company's unique position in the physical and digital world. The net impact of all these changes is an increase in our EBIT margins, a strong balance sheet and a company well positioned for the future. 
Finally, our last initiative, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. In May of 2013, we identified a series of digital markets that, in aggregate, represented close to $30 billion of opportunity growing at a double-digit rate. We said it was our objective to lead in those markets and grow at double-digit rates. 
To many of you, it probably seems as a touch of an aspiration, given those businesses have not grown in several years. In 2014, those businesses grew over 20% and now represent more than 20% of our portfolio. Good progress from a standing start 2 years ago, but we're just scratching the surface. 
Bottom line, Pitney Bowes is a different company today than it was 2 years ago. We committed to a strategic plan, laid out markers, and we have executed. That said, quarter-to-quarter, there may be factors like changes in go-to-market or currency fluctuations that affect results, but our strategy is aimed at delivering real shareholder value over the long term. Much more to do, and we are in the middle [ph] of a multiyear transformation, but we have created substantial value, and we have more in our sites. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike to give you the specifics on the fourth quarter and the year."

As Marc mentioned, we're very pleased with our full year results as we achieved our annual guidance targets for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. 
For the full year, excluding the impact of the divested revenues in Europe, revenue grew 2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.90 and free cash flow was $571 million. 
We were able to achieve our annual guidance targets on strong Digital Commerce Solutions and Presort Services revenue growth and the benefits of our operational excellence cost initiatives. We achieved these results despite changes to our SMB portfolio and sales force, a challenging year-over-year comparison in our Production Mail business and a strengthening U.S. dollar, particularly in the latter part of the year. 
We worked through these challenges. We stayed focused and even expanded our cost-reduction initiatives. We continue to optimize our business portfolio by also investing in our growth initiatives, a new ERP system and a new brand. We also continued to effectively implement our capital allocation strategy and returned value to our shareholders through a competitive dividend and a $50 million share repurchase. Our actions throughout the years support our multiyear strategy to stabilize our mailing business, achieve operational excellence and invest for growth. 
I will update you first on how the actions we have taken positively impact our fourth quarter results and discuss later how we expect these actions to impact our 2015 and midterm financial results. 
Turning to the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $984 million compared to the prior year. Revenue declined less than 1% on a constant-currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. 
Despite the headline reported revenue decline, our underlying operational performance was solid. As we noted last quarter, we exited a non-core product line in Norway and transitioned to a dealer sales network for 6 smaller markets in Europe. The divested revenues associated with these actions were approximately $12 million and were not restated as a discontinued operation. 
Adjusting for these divested revenues and the impact of currencies, which was about $20 million, our underlying operations grew 1%. This is in line with our overall results for the year. 
During the quarter, the growth rates for each of the 3 segment groups continue to progress towards our longer-term expectations as outlined at our Analyst Day in May. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 13% in Digital Commerce Solutions and declined 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions. 
SMB Solutions revenue declined 5% on a constant-currency basis, but declined only 3% when also adjusted for the divested revenues. For SMB, this is an improvement in trend and a solid progress in our stabilization efforts. 
We also continue to reduce SG&A expenses versus prior year as a result of the ongoing implementation of our go-to-market strategy as well as other cost-reduction initiatives throughout the business. We achieved a reduction in SG&A despite increased investment in our new ERP system, increased investment in marketing in support of the new brand and the investment in growth initiatives. 
We have reduced the baseline SG&A by $136 million. This exceeds our original cost savings target of $100 million to $125 million, and we're not done yet. 
We have identified and recorded restructuring costs in the fourth quarter for an expanded set of initiatives that are expected to add an additional $30 million to $40 million of annualized benefits, principally in 2015. More on that later. 
The revenue results and reduced costs are reflected in our adjusted EBIT dollar and margin growth versus prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.51 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Currency had a $0.01 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter and prior year results included a tax benefit of $0.04 per share. 
Adjusting for these factors, for comparative purposes, adjusted EPS grew 11% in the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.29, which included a restructuring charge of $0.22 per share associated with an expansion of our previously announced cost-reduction plans. 
GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.31, which included income of $0.02 per share from discontinued operations. Free cash flow during the quarter was $154 million. And on a GAAP basis, we generated $258 million in cash from operations. 
In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was primarily impacted by the timing of tax payments, the timing of working capital requirements and higher capital expenditures related to our ERP implementation. 
During the quarter, we used $38 million of cash to return capital to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, and we made $14 million in restructuring payments. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $100 million share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to the income statement. Please note that all income statement related results are on an adjusted basis. A reconciliation of adjusted to recorded financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $201 million this quarter, which was $13 million or 7% higher than the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 20.4%, which was an increase of 180 basis points over prior year. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $255 million. SG&A for the quarter was $347 million or $15 million less than in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 35.3%, which was an improvement of 50 basis points. 
As I mentioned earlier, we achieved this despite the incremental expense related to the new ERP implementation. Excluding the ERP expense, SG&A would have been 34.5% of revenue this quarter or 110 basis points improvement. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $62 million for actions associated with our previously announced plans to reduce costs. While we are taking a number of actions across our business, a significant portion of these charges relate to our decision to accelerate our go-to-market strategy in Europe. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $42 million, which was a decline of about $2.5 million when compared to the prior year. This is the result of actions we have taken to reduce and manage our debt over the last year. 
Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.27%, which was about 13 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate and adjusted earnings for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 25% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Last year's lower tax rate resulted from our favorable resolution of certain tax matters that resulted in a benefit to the income statement in the quarter. 
Turning to our financial performance for the full year. As I noted earlier, our results are consistent with our annual guidance. For the full year, revenue totaled $3.8 billion, which was growth of 1% when compared to prior year on both the constant-currency and reported basis. 
For comparative purposes, if we adjust the results for the impact of the actions we took in Europe earlier in the year, revenue would have grown 2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the full year was $1.90. Currency had about a $0.02 per share negative impact on earnings for the year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.47, which included a restructuring charge of $0.29 per share for the year, income of $0.05 per share related to the company's divestiture of an investment in the third quarter and $0.19 per share of debt extinguishment costs from the first quarter. 
GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.64, which includes income of $0.17 per share from discontinued operations. Free cash flow for the full year was $571 million, which is at the high end of our guidance range. 
On a GAAP basis, we generated $656 million in cash from operations. Overall, cash flow was impacted by our incremental CapEx investment in our new ERP system, lower finance receivables and the timing of tax payments. 
During the year, we used our cash flow to return $152 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends. We paid down $100 million of debt, made $56 million in restructuring payments, bought back $50 million of our stock and invested in the business. 
Looking at balance sheet at year-end. We had $3.3 billion of debt on the balance sheet, which was $94 million less than prior year. The company ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash on hand. 
Also, stockholders' equity was reduced by $128 million from prior year. This was primarily due to the remeasurement of the company's pension and post-retirement obligations, which incorporated the decline in discount rates and the adoption of new mortality assumptions. 
Now I'd like to discuss the fourth quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $376 million and EBIT was $166 million. When compared to the prior year, revenue declined 4.2% on a reported basis and 3.6% on a constant-currency basis. 
We expect this positive momentum to continue as the new go-to-market efforts mature. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvements in the company's expanded inside sales organization. And as a result, revenue declined at a lesser rate than in the second and third quarters. 
The direct sales organization delivered higher productivity, which resulted in an increased average order value. Recurring revenue streams also continued to stabilize due to a further moderation in the decline of financing and rentals revenue. 
EBIT margin was 44%, which was a decline of 80 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business and fewer lease extensions than the prior year. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $134 million and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant-currency basis and 15% on a reported basis. Revenue declined just 2%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. 
These results are in line with recent trends and the company's efforts to stabilize overall mail-related revenue. We were able to achieve these results despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe. 
Also, excluding the impact of the divested revenues and currency, supplies revenue continue to grow, which was offset by a moderate decline in equipment sales. EBIT margin was 16%, which was an improvement of 430 basis points versus the prior year due to the benefits from changes in go to market, including the shift in strategy for smaller markets and limited moves of client accounts to inside sales in major European markets during the quarter. 
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $132 million and EBIT was $20 million. Revenue declined 10% on a constant-currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. 
Revenue comparisons for the quarter were impacted by fewer large multiunit inserting and production print equipment installations than in the prior year. EBIT margin was 14.9%, which was an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the higher mix of inserting business, improved margin on service revenue and ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $117 million and EBIT was $30 million. Revenue grew 9% on both the constant-currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the improved qualification of mail for presort discounts as a result of operational efficiencies, an increase in the volume of first-class mail processed and the effective implementation of the postal rate and rule changes at the beginning of 2014. EBIT margin was 25.6%, which was an improvement of 870 basis points versus the prior year due to the revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity. 
For the Digital Commerce Solutions segment, revenue was $225 million, and EBIT was $32 million. Revenue grew 13% on a constant-currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. 
The segment again experienced revenue growth in each of its 4 product categories: Ecommerce, Software, Shipping and Marketing Services. ecommerce growth was driven by strong increases in the number of packages shipped and benefited from the initial ramp up of the U.K. outbound cross-border services. However, the strength in the U.S. dollar had a dampening effect on the rate of increase in the number of purchases from the U.S. over the course of the quarter. 
Software revenue growth was led by a significant increase in licensing revenue, particularly Enterprise Location Intelligence software, reflecting the success from our ongoing investments in product and channel specialization. 
Revenue growth in the areas of shipping solutions and marketing services resulted from new client acquisitions for their respective product offerings. 
EBIT margin was 14.1%, which was an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. The EBIT margin improvement reflects the benefit of earnings leverage from revenue growth, net of the impact of our continued investments in technology and infrastructure across the Digital Commerce portfolio. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter and year. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company. 
2015 represents a critical third year in our journey. It is the peak year for investment as we complete our major go-to-market initiatives, the build-out of our ERP program, invest in brand and marketing to build greater awareness of our unique capabilities. 
To better reflect the leverage that these activities will deliver, we are providing guidance for 2015 as well as some insights on how our strategic initiatives and operational excellence program will impact future results. As in the past, we are providing guidance on a constant-currency basis. As we have seen in recent months, currency exchange rates are subject to substantial movement over time. Therefore, reported results may vary materially from a constant-currency view. The guidance provided here assumes that the global economy and foreign exchange markets will not change significantly from current levels. 
For 2015, revenue excluding the impacts from currency is expected to be in a range of flat to 3% growth when compared to 2014. It is important to note that on a full year basis, 2014 included about $30 million of revenue related to our non-core product lines that we exited in Norway and 6 smaller European markets that we transitioned to a dealer sales network. 
The impact to revenue comparisons reflected in our guidance for 2015 is that 1% of lower revenue growth. To give you a sense of the impact of currency volatility on reported revenue, current exchange rates would result in reported revenue for 2015 being more than 3 percentage points lower than our constant-currency range. 
From a sensitivity perspective, each 5% movement in the exchange rates material to our business would result in about 150 basis points change in reported revenue growth rate. The composition of our revenue growth is expected to be broadly consistent with the market growth rates for our business segments as presented at Analyst Day last May. 
For the year, we expect double-digit revenue growth in the Digital Commerce Solutions segment as we continue to expand our ecommerce offerings and drive continued growth in our software, shipping and marketing services businesses. We expect flat to modest revenue growth in the Enterprise Solutions group from continued growth in our Presort Services operation, driven by additional new clients and higher processed mail volume. This growth maybe partially offset by headwinds in our Production Mail business, resulting from the uncertain European economy as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. 
We expect a low single-digit decline in revenue in the SMB Solutions Group as trends continue to improve and stabilize in our North American Mailing business. We expect improved productivity from changes in our sales force. However, as we implement the strategy in other global markets in 2015, it may impact local results in the short term. 
Turning to our EPS guidance. To provide a clearer picture of the expected underlying performance of the business in 2015 compared to 2014, we provided a table on Slide 29 of our fourth quarter earnings slides presentation, which can be found in our Investor Relations website. 
To begin, adjusted EPS in 2014 of $1.90 included a onetime tax benefit of $0.08 per share that is not expected to be repeated in 2015. That provides a baseline of $1.82 per share in 2014 for comparative purposes. 
Our GAAP EPS from continuing operations for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $2. This reflects the benefits of growth in our business as well as substantial benefits from our operational excellence initiative. These benefits will be partially offset by incremental investments versus 2014, specifically related to our ERP program and a higher ongoing spend on our brand and marketing activities. 
These incremental expenses in aggregate are expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share in 2015. When adding back the incremental ERP investment of $0.07 to $0.09 per share to our GAAP EPS guidance range for 2015, the underlying operations reflecting earnings growth range of 5% to 15% when compared to the $1.82 comparative EPS in 2014. 
Please note, we expect the costs associated with our ERP implementation and marketing efforts to be higher in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. ERP spend reflects the resources for development, testing and data conversion, and in the case of the marketing expense, this is related to brand launch and awareness building activities. 
The company expects a tax rate in the range of 31% to 34% for 2015. This range is compared to a 2014 tax rate on adjusted earnings of 27.7%, which included onetime benefits that are not expected to repeat in 2015. 
The higher range in 2015 reflects the changes in our portfolio as well as having closed prior year open tax audits that have given rise to tax benefits over the last few years. Free cash flow for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $550 million. This guidance assumes free cash flow will be primarily earnings driven in 2015. In addition, we expect our SMB finance receivables portfolio will continue to stabilize. This also assumes CapEx spending will be similar to 2014 and in the range of $170 million to $190 million, including ERP investment. 
As I noted earlier, we are providing some insight with regard to our future results that highlights the leverage that our business transformations is expected to provide over the next 3 to 5 years. Over the next several years, we expect to further realize the benefits from the investments we made in 2014 and 2015. 
This includes benefits from fully implementing our go-to-market strategy globally. In addition, we begin to get benefits from the incremental investments associated with our brand, marketing and web efforts, which we expect to be part of our expense base in the future. We also expect our 2016 results will benefit as we begin to reduce our investment ERP and fully realize the $30 million to $40 million of reduced cost that I noted earlier. 
In addition, we expect incremental earnings from growth in revenue and operational leverage. Further, we expect the implementation of our ERP system globally to occur principally in 2016. Therefore, as previously discussed, we expect to realize substantial savings in 2017 and beyond as part of the plan we announced at our May 2014 Analyst Day meeting. 
In summary, during a complex transformation of the company, there are many moving parts, but the takeaway from our outlook is clear. We are investing and involving our portfolio to drive sustainable growth and doing so while relentlessly driving improvements in efficiencies in our client-facing and back-office processes. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

And if you unlayer it even more, you'll get claims like U.S. to Russia where there was fairly dramatic currency impacts. I mean, those claims were commensurately affected.

Let me start with -- we tend to focus predominantly on SMB for understandable reasons. We haven't talked a lot about Software, and we have experienced a fairly substantial change in our go-to-market there with a much more specialized sales force. If you look at the measure that we're staring at in Software besides license revenue growth, which I would point to as really a strong marker for the quarter, if you look at our yield rate on deals kind of our pipeline, our yield rate on the pipeline in the fourth quarter was almost 10 points above what it was the previous year. So that speaks to the impact of specialization as it relates to Software in particular. With this SMB, there's really couple of different ways that we look at. The first and obvious is kind of SG&A as a percent of revenue. So obviously, we're doing -- I won't say more, but we're doing with a lot less people a similar revenue trajectory, if I could say it that way, with what we've experienced so far is better client service. And if you were to point to the U.S. PS market share data, at least stable share to, if not, up a tick. So we look at a bunch of different metrics as it relates to the productivity of our sales force, and we obviously get it down to our salesman level, what they're doing on a daily basis. So we have great tools that were, I would say, early innings on between Salesforce.com and a few other kind of adjacent tools that largely, you get productivity that are very granular level.

By now, I hope you had a chance to review the press release announcing our full year and fourth quarter financial results and our guidance for 2015. 
We are very pleased with our results for all of 2014, including our fourth quarter performance. We did a good job navigating a fairly turbulent macroeconomic environment. The fourth quarter clearly demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model, our strong market position and our strong offerings. Mike will provide an overview of our fourth quarter, full year and our 2015 guidance. I'm going to provide perspective and our overall transformation. 
Bottom line, we've made tremendous progress against our 3 strategic initiatives to transform our company and unlock shareholder value. Just to remind everyone, our 3 strategic initiatives are: number one, stabilize our mail businesses; number two, drive operational excellence; and finally, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. 
Let me take you to those initiatives in order. First, stabilizing the mail business. Over the last 2 years, we have taken steps to reengineer our go-to-market model moving to sales techniques, which are much more scalable, including telesales and the web. These initiatives are providing the benefits of providing better client service and are substantially more efficient. This transition is complete in North America and underway in Europe. 
In the second quarter, we pointed to some disruption in our North American business as we changed our coverage model. We continue to have some disruptions in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we saw improvements from the trends in the second and third quarter, and we continue to expect improvement going forward. We're in the process of executing these go-to-market changes in Europe, and we expect to continue to execute these changes on a country-by-country basis throughout Europe. Again, we are confident that these go-to-market changes will provide better client service and be dramatically more efficient. 
Second, operational excellence. In May of 2013, we committed to reduce our going rate expense as we entered into 2015 by $100 million to $125 million. We've done that, and we did that while we have made substantial investments in our future, investments in our systems, our brand and importantly, our products. We've made substantial progress reducing our DSO and our inventory levels. Our inventory levels are about half what they were only 2 years ago. 
We committed to investment-grade ratios. To that end, we have both retired and refinanced debt. We have fine-tuned our geographic footprint and our product portfolio, focusing on specific markets and partnering in other geographic markets where we have competitive advantage and importantly, make good returns. 
And finally, in January this year, we relaunched our brand supported by a new website. This was much more than putting a fresh coat of paint on an old car. The brand reflects our company's unique position in the physical and digital world. The net impact of all these changes is an increase in our EBIT margins, a strong balance sheet and a company well positioned for the future. 
Finally, our last initiative, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. In May of 2013, we identified a series of digital markets that, in aggregate, represented close to $30 billion of opportunity growing at a double-digit rate. We said it was our objective to lead in those markets and grow at double-digit rates. 
To many of you, it probably seems, as a touch of an aspiration, given those businesses have not grown in several years. In 2014, those businesses grew over 20% and now represent more than 20% of our portfolio. Good progress from a standing start 2 years ago, but we're just scratching the surface. 
Bottom line, Pitney Bowes is a different company today than it was 2 years ago. We committed to a strategic plan, laid out markers, and we have executed. That said, quarter-to-quarter, there may be factors like changes in go-to-market or currency fluctuations that affect results, but our strategy is aimed at delivering real shareholder value over the long term. Much more to do, and we are in the middle [ph] of a multiyear transformation, but we have created substantial value, and we have more in our sites. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike to give you the specifics on the fourth quarter and the year."

As Marc mentioned, we're very pleased with our full year results as we achieved our annual guidance targets for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. 
For the full year, excluding the impact of the divested revenues in Europe, revenue grew 2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.90 and free cash flow was $571 million. 
We were able to achieve our annual guidance targets on strong Digital Commerce Solutions and Presort Services revenue growth and the benefits of our operational excellence cost initiatives. We achieved these results despite changes to our SMB portfolio and sales force, a challenging year-over-year comparison in our Production Mail business and a strengthening U.S. dollar, particularly in the latter part of the year. 
We worked through these challenges. We stayed focused and even expanded our cost-reduction initiatives. We continue to optimize our business portfolio by also investing in our growth initiatives, a new ERP system and a new brand. We also continued to effectively implement our capital allocation strategy and returned value to our shareholders through a competitive dividend and a $50 million share repurchase. Our actions throughout the years support our multiyear strategy to stabilize our mailing business, achieve operational excellence and invest for growth. 
I will update you first on how the actions we have taken positively impact our fourth quarter results and discuss later how we expect these actions to impact our 2015 and midterm financial results. 
Turning to the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $984 million compared to the prior year. Revenue declined less than 1% on a constant-currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. 
Despite the headline reported revenue decline, our underlying operational performance was solid. As we noted last quarter, we exited a non-core product line in Norway and transitioned to a dealer sales network for 6 smaller markets in Europe. The divested revenues associated with these actions were approximately $12 million and were not restated as a discontinued operation. 
Adjusting for these divested revenues and the impact of currencies, which was about $20 million, our underlying operations grew 1%. This is in line with our overall results for the year. 
During the quarter, the growth rates for each of the 3 segment groups continue to progress towards our longer-term expectations as outlined at our Analyst Day in May. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 13% in Digital Commerce Solutions and declined 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions. 
SMB Solutions revenue declined 5% on a constant-currency basis, but declined only 3% when also adjusted for the divested revenues. For SMB, this is an improvement in trend and a solid progress in our stabilization efforts. 
We also continue to reduce SG&A expenses versus prior year as a result of the ongoing implementation of our go-to-market strategy as well as other cost-reduction initiatives throughout the business. We achieved a reduction in SG&A despite increased investment in our new ERP system, increased investment in marketing in support of the new brand and the investment in growth initiatives. 
We have reduced the baseline SG&A by $136 million. This exceeds our original cost savings target of $100 million to $125 million, and we're not done yet. 
We have identified and recorded restructuring costs in the fourth quarter for an expanded set of initiatives that are expected to add an additional $30 million to $40 million of annualized benefits, principally in 2015. More on that later. 
The revenue results and reduced costs are reflected in our adjusted EBIT dollar and margin growth versus prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.51 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Currency had a $0.01 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter and prior year results included a tax benefit of $0.04 per share. 
Adjusting for these factors, for comparative purposes, adjusted EPS grew 11% in the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.29, which included a restructuring charge of $0.22 per share associated with an expansion of our previously announced cost-reduction plans. 
GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.31, which included income of $0.02 per share from discontinued operations. Free cash flow during the quarter was $154 million. And on a GAAP basis, we generated $258 million in cash from operations. 
In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was primarily impacted by the timing of tax payments, the timing of working capital requirements and higher capital expenditures related to our ERP implementation. 
During the quarter, we used $38 million of cash to return capital to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, and we made $14 million in restructuring payments. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $100 million share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to the income statement. Please note that all income statement related results are on an adjusted basis. A reconciliation of adjusted to recorded financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $201 million this quarter, which was $13 million or 7% higher than the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 20.4%, which was an increase of 180 basis points over prior year. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $255 million. SG&A for the quarter was $347 million or $15 million less than in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 35.3%, which was an improvement of 50 basis points. 
As I mentioned earlier, we achieved this despite the incremental expense related to the new ERP implementation. Excluding the ERP expense, SG&A would have been 34.5% of revenue this quarter or 110 basis points improvement. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $62 million for actions associated with our previously announced plans to reduce costs. While we are taking a number of actions across our business, a significant portion of these charges relate to our decision to accelerate our go-to-market strategy in Europe. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $42 million, which was a decline of about $2.5 million when compared to the prior year. This is the result of actions we have taken to reduce and manage our debt over the last year. 
Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.27%, which was about 13 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate and adjusted earnings for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 25% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Last year's lower tax rate resulted from our favorable resolution of certain tax matters that resulted in a benefit to the income statement in the quarter. 
Turning to our financial performance for the full year. As I noted earlier, our results are consistent with our annual guidance. For the full year, revenue totaled $3.8 billion, which was growth of 1% when compared to prior year on both the constant-currency and reported basis. 
For comparative purposes, if we adjust the results for the impact of the actions we took in Europe earlier in the year, revenue would have grown 2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the full year was $1.90. Currency had about a $0.02 per share negative impact on earnings for the year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.47, which included a restructuring charge of $0.29 per share for the year, income of $0.05 per share related to the company's divestiture of an investment in the third quarter and $0.19 per share of debt extinguishment costs from the first quarter. 
GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.64, which includes income of $0.17 per share from discontinued operations. Free cash flow for the full year was $571 million, which is at the high end of our guidance range. 
On a GAAP basis, we generated $656 million in cash from operations. Overall, cash flow was impacted by our incremental CapEx investment in our new ERP system, lower finance receivables and the timing of tax payments. 
During the year, we used our cash flow to return $152 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends. We paid down $100 million of debt, made $56 million in restructuring payments, bought back $50 million of our stock and invested in the business. 
Looking at balance sheet at year-end. We had $3.3 billion of debt on the balance sheet, which was $94 million less than prior year. The company ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash on hand. 
Also, stockholders' equity was reduced by $128 million from prior year. This was primarily due to the remeasurement of the company's pension and post-retirement obligations, which incorporated the decline in discount rates and the adoption of new mortality assumptions. 
Now I'd like to discuss the fourth quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $376 million and EBIT was $166 million. When compared to the prior year, revenue declined 4.2% on a reported basis and 3.6% on a constant-currency basis. 
We expect this positive momentum to continue as the new go-to-market efforts mature. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvements in the company's expanded inside sales organization. And as a result, revenue declined at a lesser rate than in the second and third quarters. 
The direct sales organization delivered higher productivity, which resulted in an increased average order value. Recurring revenue streams also continued to stabilize due to a further moderation in the decline of financing and rentals revenue. 
EBIT margin was 44%, which was a decline of 80 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business and fewer lease extensions than the prior year. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $134 million and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant-currency basis and 15% on a reported basis. Revenue declined just 2%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. 
These results are in line with recent trends and the company's efforts to stabilize overall mail-related revenue. We were able to achieve these results despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe. 
Also, excluding the impact of the divested revenues and currency, supplies revenue continue to grow, which was offset by a moderate decline in equipment sales. EBIT margin was 16%, which was an improvement of 430 basis points versus the prior year due to the benefits from changes in go to market, including the shift in strategy for smaller markets and limited moves of client accounts to inside sales in major European markets during the quarter. 
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $132 million and EBIT was $20 million. Revenue declined 10% on a constant-currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. 
Revenue comparisons for the quarter were impacted by fewer large multiunit inserting and production print equipment installations than in the prior year. EBIT margin was 14.9%, which was an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the higher mix of inserting business, improved margin on service revenue and ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $117 million and EBIT was $30 million. Revenue grew 9% on both the constant-currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the improved qualification of mail for presort discounts as a result of operational efficiencies, an increase in the volume of first-class mail processed and the effective implementation of the postal rate and rule changes at the beginning of 2014. EBIT margin was 25.6%, which was an improvement of 870 basis points versus the prior year due to the revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity. 
For the Digital Commerce Solutions segment, revenue was $225 million, and EBIT was $32 million. Revenue grew 13% on a constant-currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. 
The segment again experienced revenue growth in each of its 4 product categories: Ecommerce, Software, Shipping and Marketing Services. ecommerce growth was driven by strong increases in the number of packages shipped and benefited from the initial ramp up of the U.K. outbound cross-border services. However, the strength in the U.S. dollar had a dampening effect on the rate of increase in the number of purchases from the U.S. over the course of the quarter. 
Software revenue growth was led by a significant increase in licensing revenue, particularly Enterprise Location Intelligence software, reflecting the success from our ongoing investments in product and channel specialization. 
Revenue growth in the areas of shipping solutions and marketing services resulted from new client acquisitions for their respective product offerings. 
EBIT margin was 14.1%, which was an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. The EBIT margin improvement reflects the benefit of earnings leverage from revenue growth, net of the impact of our continued investments in technology and infrastructure across the Digital Commerce portfolio. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter and year. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company. 
2015 represents a critical third year in our journey. It is the peak year for investment as we complete our major go-to-market initiatives, the build-out of our ERP program, invest in brand and marketing to build greater awareness of our unique capabilities. 
To better reflect the leverage that these activities will deliver, we are providing guidance for 2015 as well as some insights on how our strategic initiatives and operational excellence program will impact future results. As in the past, we are providing guidance on a constant-currency basis. As we have seen in recent months, currency exchange rates are subject to substantial movement over time. Therefore, reported results may vary materially from a constant-currency view. The guidance provided here assumes that the global economy and foreign exchange markets will not change significantly from current levels. 
For 2015, revenue excluding the impacts from currency is expected to be in a range of flat to 3% growth when compared to 2014. It is important to note that on a full year basis, 2014 included about $30 million of revenue related to our non-core product lines that we exited in Norway and 6 smaller European markets that we transitioned to a dealer sales network. 
The impact to revenue comparisons reflected in our guidance for 2015 is that 1% of lower revenue growth. To give you a sense of the impact of currency volatility on reported revenue, current exchange rates would result in reported revenue for 2015 being more than 3 percentage points lower than our constant-currency range. 
From a sensitivity perspective, each 5% movement in the exchange rates material to our business would result in about 150 basis points change in reported revenue growth rate. The composition of our revenue growth is expected to be broadly consistent with the market growth rates for our business segments as presented at Analyst Day last May. 
For the year, we expect double-digit revenue growth in the Digital Commerce Solutions segment as we continue to expand our ecommerce offerings and drive continued growth in our software, shipping and marketing services businesses. We expect flat to modest revenue growth in the Enterprise Solutions group from continued growth in our Presort Services operation, driven by additional new clients and higher processed mail volume. This growth maybe partially offset by headwinds in our Production Mail business, resulting from the uncertain European economy as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. 
We expect a low single-digit decline in revenue in the SMB Solutions Group as trends continue to improve and stabilize in our North American Mailing business. We expect improved productivity from changes in our sales force. However, as we implement the strategy in other global markets in 2015, it may impact local results in the short term. 
Turning to our EPS guidance. To provide a clearer picture of the expected underlying performance of the business in 2015 compared to 2014, we provided a table on Slide 29 of our fourth quarter earnings slides presentation, which can be found in our Investor Relations website. 
To begin, adjusted EPS in 2014 of $1.90 included a onetime tax benefit of $0.08 per share that is not expected to be repeated in 2015. That provides a baseline of $1.82 per share in 2014 for comparative purposes. 
Our GAAP EPS from continuing operations for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $2. This reflects the benefits of growth in our business as well as substantial benefits from our operational excellence initiative. These benefits will be partially offset by incremental investments versus 2014, specifically related to our ERP program and a higher ongoing spend on our brand and marketing activities. 
These incremental expenses in aggregate are expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share in 2015. When adding back the incremental ERP investment of $0.07 to $0.09 per share to our GAAP EPS guidance range for 2015, the underlying operations reflecting earnings growth range of 5% to 15% when compared to the $1.82 comparative EPS in 2014. 
Please note, we expect the costs associated with our ERP implementation and marketing efforts to be higher in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. ERP spend reflects the resources for development, testing and data conversion, and in the case of the marketing expense, this is related to brand launch and awareness building activities. 
The company expects a tax rate in the range of 31% to 34% for 2015. This range is compared to a 2014 tax rate on adjusted earnings of 27.7%, which included onetime benefits that are not expected to repeat in 2015. 
The higher range in 2015 reflects the changes in our portfolio as well as having closed prior year open tax audits that have given rise to tax benefits over the last few years. Free cash flow for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $550 million. This guidance assumes free cash flow will be primarily earnings driven in 2015. In addition, we expect our SMB finance receivables portfolio will continue to stabilize. This also assumes CapEx spending will be similar to 2014 and in the range of $170 million to $190 million, including ERP investment. 
As I noted earlier, we are providing some insight with regard to our future results that highlights the leverage that our business transformations is expected to provide over the next 3 to 5 years. Over the next several years, we expect to further realize the benefits from the investments we made in 2014 and 2015. 
This includes benefits from fully implementing our go-to-market strategy globally. In addition, we begin to get benefits from the incremental investments associated with our brand, marketing and web efforts, which we expect to be part of our expense base in the future. We also expect our 2016 results will benefit as we begin to reduce our investment ERP and fully realize the $30 million to $40 million of reduced cost that I noted earlier. 
In addition, we expect incremental earnings from growth in revenue and operational leverage. Further, we expect the implementation of our ERP system globally to occur principally in 2016. Therefore, as previously discussed, we expect to realize substantial savings in 2017 and beyond as part of the plan we announced at our May 2014 Analyst Day meeting. 
In summary, during a complex transformation of the company, there are many moving parts, but the takeaway from our outlook is clear. We are investing and involving our portfolio to drive sustainable growth and doing so while relentlessly driving improvements in efficiencies in our client-facing and back-office processes. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

And if you unlayer it even more, you'll get claims like U.S. to Russia where there was fairly dramatic currency impacts. I mean, those claims were commensurately affected.

If you look at the underlying SMB equipment revenue, the other thing I should say in the consolidated is the comparison for the product line and the markets we exited in Europe. So again, sort of equalizing for those. The underlying SMB business improved over the last couple of quarters.

So that speaks to the impact of specialization as it relates to Software in particular. With this SMB, there's really couple of different ways that we look at. The first and obvious is kind of SG&A as a percent of revenue. So obviously, we're doing -- I won't say more, but we're doing with a lot less people a similar revenue trajectory, if I could say it that way, with what we've experienced so far is better client service. And if you were to point to the U.S. PS market share data, at least stable share to, if not, up a tick. So we look at a bunch of different metrics as it relates to the productivity of our sales force, and we obviously get it down to our salesman level, what they're doing on a daily basis. So we have great tools that were, I would say, early innings on between Salesforce.com and a few other kind of adjacent tools that largely, you get productivity that are very granular level. And we're looking at it at a salesman basis, I mean, almost on a daily basis."

And our first quarter results reinforce the underlying strength of our business model, the strategy to unlock value in our company. Earnings before interest and taxes grew 5%, 7% if you adjust for currency. We grew our EBIT even as we made substantial investments in our systems, our brand and our product development. Our first quarter results were affected by currency fluctuations, divestitures not accounted for in discontinued operations and a higher-than-usual tax rate. The impact of the strong dollar took almost 4 points off of revenue and divestitures reduced revenue by a little less than 1 point. We expect our tax rate to return to more normal levels later in the year in the second half of the year, with currency impacts will begin to wrap assuming the dollar stays at the current level. 
There are 3 things that are clear about the first quarter. First, we anticipate that we would be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment this year. And that's what we saw in the first quarter. Economic conditions around the world are choppy and diverging monetary policies are creating fluctuations in currencies. Second, even with these challenges, our growth grew close to double digits, excluding the impact of currency. And finally, unlike the first quarter of last year where we executed very well, our first quarter of 2015 was a more typical start to the year. 
Turning to our 3 strategic initiatives. First, stabilizing our mail business. Our enterprise mail businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our SMB business in North America performed consistent with the last several quarters. If you double click on that business, you'll find that our new channels in North America Mailing performed very well. In our field sales organization, we had a couple of large deals on the table in the public sector. Some of these deals closed in the first few days of April. It's a very good sign that our new channels are beginning to produce strong results. But as we expected, our SMB business in Europe experienced some disruptions in sales activity as a result of our go-to-market changes. 
Second, we continued our focus on operational excellence. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 220 basis points. EBIT margins increased and we continue to reduce our debt levels. Again, importantly, we did this while making significant investments in the business. Let me add one more comment here. We continue to improve our debt-to-EBITDA level, which gives us more flexibility, making capital allocation efficient. Finally, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. Our growth in our Ecommerce business slowed due to the strong dollar, continued to grow and helped propel growth in our overall Digital Commerce business. Software license revenue continued to grow and our Marketing Services business performed very, very well. One last point about our Digital Commerce Solutions business. One of our strategic opportunities that is truly our software products is through our SMB channel. Last year, we began to pursue this opportunity aggressively. In the first quarter of 2015, our Shipping business began to make real progress. More on this as the year unfolds. 
All in all, we are continuing to execute our plan against a relatively choppy environment. The first quarter provides continued evidence that we are on the right track and we are reaffirming our guidance for 2015. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike to take you through a more detailed view of our first quarter results."

Adjusting for currency and the business as we divested in Europe last year, revenue was flat. We were able to grow EBIT 5% and improved EBIT margins to 20% for our operational excellence efforts. Despite a higher tax rate and currency impacts, we delivered earnings per share, in line with our expectations. Changes in currency are having a significant impact on reported results for global companies while our international exposure is not as great as other companies, we're not immune to the effects, particularly of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted of revenue comparisons by $34 million or nearly 4% and our earnings per share by $0.01. As Marc referenced, we did see positive results in many areas of the business. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue growth was still solid this quarter. EBIT expanded nicely despite the strengthening U.S. dollar dampening effect on our Ecommerce package volumes from the U.S. and a slower rate of Software revenue growth. Our Presort Services business continued to grow both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail revenue was flat, excluding the changes in currency and EBIT margin was also improved. Our North American Mailing business continue to have trends in line with the prior 3 quarters for revenue and EBIT margin continued to improve year-over-year. We experienced some disruption in our European mailing equipment sales, particularly in France as we transitioned our go-to-market model there. As a reminder, last year, we announced that we exited a non-core product line in Norway and moved to a dealer network in 6 smaller European markets. Note that these strategic actions were not reclassified as discontinued operations. As a result, our year-over-year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by 1% on a consolidated basis and at the total SMB level and by nearly 5% in International Mailing. 
In order to properly understand our underlying operational results, it's important to take the impacts of currency and our strategic actions in Europe into consideration. Where appropriate, I'll address the impacts to growth rates of both factors. Let me now take you through the details of our income statement and then I'll review our business segment results. As a reminder, the company's first quarter earnings related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $891 million, which was a decline of 1% on a constant-currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Total revenue was flat to the prior year when both periods are adjusted for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year. On a constant-currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues, revenue grew 9% in Digital Commerce Solutions, grew 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 5% in SMB Solutions. On a reported basis, revenue grew 6% in Digital Commerce Solutions, was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 11% in SMB Solutions, reflecting the significant impact of currency during the quarter. When compared to the prior year, our SG&A declined to $22 million on a constant-currency basis and $37 million on a reported basis. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by about 220 basis points as we remain focused on streamlining our operations and being more efficient. Investment in our new ERP system and our marketing expenses increased over prior year by about $4 million. 
Due to some timing issues, particularly related to marketing spend, we now expect these expenses to be at the highest in the second and the third quarters of this year. When we initially provided guidance in February, we anticipated these expenses would be greater in the first half of the year. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $43 million, which was a decline of about $1 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $178 million, a growth of 5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 150 basis points. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $221 million, growth of 3% versus prior year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant-currency basis. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 37.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year. Last year's tax rate included a favorable resolution of certain tax matters that resulted in a $6 million tax benefit. The higher tax rate this quarter is partially due to charges related to the expiration of certain stock options and a greater percentage of revenue from U.S. operations. 
Turning to earnings per share. Despite the challenging economic environment and lower revenue, we were still able to deliver solid EBIT growth and earnings per share in line with our expectations. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.40 compared to $0.42 in the prior year. Currency had a $0.01 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter. Additionally, the higher tax rate this quarter negatively impacted EPS by about $0.03 per share when compared to the midpoint of the range for our expected tax rate on an annualized basis. We still expect the tax rate for the full year to be in our original guidance range of 31% to 34%. 
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $85 million and on a GAAP basis, we generated $104 million in cash from operations. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was lower this quarter, primarily due to the timing of accounts payable and higher capital expenditures related to the company's ERP implementation. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.1 billion of debt, which was about $177 million lower than the prior year and we had $913 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $157 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.4%, which was about flat to the prior year. During the quarter, we returned to $38 million of cash to our common shareholders in the form of dividends and we made $22 million of restructuring payments. Also, during the quarter, we redeemed $275 million of debt that matured in March through use of $175 million in cash on the balance sheet and $100 million in commercial paper. 
Turning to our business segment results. In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $362 million and EBIT was $164 million. Revenue declined 4% on a constant-currency basis and 5% on a reported basis while EBIT increased 2%. Revenue for the quarter was consistent with the prior 3 quarters result. Recurring revenue stream trends were in line with prior quarters, driven primarily by financing revenue, which declined less than 1% in continued stabilization of rentals revenue. 
In the U.S., equipment sales declined at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a relatively strong first quarter of 2014, which was just prior to the significant channel resources shift as part of the go-to-market strategy. We expect the trend for equipment sales to improve as the initial go-to-market changes begin to annualize. EBIT margin was 45.2%, which was an improvement of 310 basis points versus the prior year, driven by savings from our go-to-market implementation as well as other ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $116 million and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 12% on a constant-currency basis and 24% on a reported basis. Excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier, revenue declined 7%. During the quarter, we ramped up the implementation of our go-to-market strategy throughout Europe. This transition was first completed in the U.K. in January, which had positive revenue growth during the quarter and is now complete in Germany. However, in France, our second largest market in Europe, we are still in the early notification and consultation stages of the proposed go-to-market transition, which has significantly impacted sales productivity there. Lower sales in France account for a large portion of the International Mailing revenue decline after the impact of currency and the divested revenues. EBIT margin was 10.1%, which was a decline of 610 basis points versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenue performance and the impact of currency on some supply chain cost. 
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $100 million and EBIT was $9 million. Revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis and declined 5% on a reported basis. Excluding the currency and the divested revenues in Europe related to the segment, revenue would have grown 1%. Equipment sales grew as a result of a larger number of inserting equipment installations during the quarter. Supplies revenue continued to benefit from the growth in production print installations in 2014. 
Support services revenue declined as a result of some of in-house mailers shipping their mail processing to third-party outsourcers who provide some self-service on equipment. EBIT margin was 9.1%, which was an improvement of 170 basis points versus the prior year due to higher mix of inserting equipment and ongoing cost reduction initiatives. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $27 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the addition of new customers and an increase in the volume of mail process. EBIT margin was 22.6%, which was an improvement of 210 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives. 
For the Digital Commerce Solutions segment, revenue was $192 million and EBIT was $16 million. Revenue grew 9% on a constant-currency basis and 6% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, the segment continue to deliver revenue growth in Ecommerce, Shipping Solutions and Marketing Services. Software revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis. Ecommerce's revenue growth was driven in part by a continued increase on the number of packages shipped but did also reflect the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the number of purchases held down from the U.S. Ecommerce also achieved continued expansion in its U.K. outbound Cross-Border Services. 
Marketing Services and Shipping Solutions revenue continue to grow as a result of new client addition for the respective product offerings. Software license revenue increase at a high single-digit rate on a constant-currency basis but was offset by lower professional services and maintenance revenue when compared to the prior year. EBIT margin was 8.3%, which was an improvement of 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin improved even as the company continue to invest in development activities and infrastructure in Ecommerce and Software Solutions. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company. 
We are reaffirming our annual guidance for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of flat to 3% growth on a constant-currency basis. Earnings per share are still expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $2. And free cash flow still expected to be in the range of $475 million to $550 million for the year. 
As I noted when I originally gave guidance in February, currency exchange rates could reduce reported revenues versus constant-currency revenue by more than 3 percentage points on an annual basis. EPS could also be adversely impacted by about $0.04 to $0.06 per share on an annual basis. Additionally, the actions completed in the third quarter of 2014 to exit the non-core product line in Norway and transition to a dealer sales network in 6 smaller European markets are expected to adversely impact total revenue comparisons for 2015 by about $30 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, equaling about 1% on an annual basis. 
As I mentioned last quarter, 2015 represents a critical third year in our business transformation. It is the peak year for investment as we complete our major go-to-market initiatives internationally, continued the build-out of our ERP program and increase investment in our brand and marketing to build greater awareness of our unique capabilities. We originally anticipated that the investment in these areas would be more heavily weighted in the first half of the year. But the timing and mix for some of these expenses has shifted. We now expect the highest periods of incremental earnings impact when compared to the prior year, with more concentrated in the second quarter and third quarter. 
In the full year, we still expect the incremental expenses related to our ERP program and marketing efforts in the aggregate to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share. That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

The overall SMB business in North America, ironically, was affected by some large deals that we let in the table with our field sales. So that will happen some of your large deals kind of look flat from 1 quarter to another. In international, so in Europe, as you kind of unlayer it, as Michael indicated before, you got to look at it on a country basis. We're done in the U.K. I would note in the U.K., we had good performance, not just overall, but as well in our new channels. Again, we see that as a very positive sign. We are done in Germany. Germany performed as we would have expected, given the disruptions. And I would say the are in the early innings in France, in terms of working our way through the process with the works councils.

And so the deals that were on the table, potentially, would take a closer to flat. But it will see how much of that we get in, in total of the opportunity. But certainly, we saw some of them come in early in the year. So the key drivers behind bringing that closer to level is equipment sales. We saw very good performance again in recurring revenue streams. Financing income down just 1%. Actually, it's slightly less than 1%. Rental comparisons continue to improve. So I think as market outlined, the channel maturity is really the key drivers to that as we go forward. And in the first quarter, that inside sales which Marc referred to as new channels, achieved our objectives in the quarter. So we continue to move in the right direction. And obviously, this is the last quarter since we've made the big changes last year. So we begin to have comparisons on an apples-to-apples basis going forward."

The U.K., France and Germany. The U.K. transitioned through that well. If you take all of the noise out of the system, in other words, look at the International Mailing revenue performance this quarter, nearly half of it was currency-related. And then another 5 percentage points were -- was related to the comparison for the businesses that we exited last year. That gets you down to a negative 7%. Most all of that was related to Germany in terms of their -- I'm sorry, to France, related to their comparison year-over-year. So if you look at a very low single digit, 1% or 2% decline year-over-year x those factors, that's very much in the range of the performance of plus or minus 2% we've seen in Europe over the last several quarters, if not several years. And so, we think the impacts are fairly isolated. We know what we have left to complete in that process. Other markets beyond those big 3 become quite a bit smaller. Once again past U.K., France, Germany and in North America, Canada as an international market which is already through well, then the rest are relatively small.

I mean, we grew high single digits in constant currency at a license level in the first quarter. That's off of the fourth quarter. We think we did 20% or 30% in terms of license revenue. To kind of look at that from where we started, that's pretty impressive. We have -- I would say at this point, a fairly stable leadership team in North America. We have a newer leadership team outside of North America. And I would expect that those leaders get in place, then we'll continue to make judgments about what they need to do.

So we expect for ourselves a very stringent criteria around the acquisitions in terms of IRR and when we need to be accretive, et cetera.

And our first quarter results reinforce the underlying strength of our business model and the strategy to unlock value in our company.Earnings before in",598,"Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. 2015 is a very important year in our transformation. And our first quarter results reinforce the underlying strength of our business model and the strategy to unlock value in our company.
Earnings before interest and taxes grew 5%, 7% if you adjust for currency. We grew our EBIT even as we made substantial investments in our systems, our brand and our product development. Our first quarter results were affected by currency fluctuations, divestitures not accounted for in discontinued operations and the higher-than-usual tax rate.
The impact of the strong dollar took almost 4 points off of revenue and divestitures reduced revenue by a little less than 1 point. We expect our tax rate to return to more normal levels later in the year, in the second half of the year, that currency impacts will begin to wrap assuming the dollar stays at the current level.
There are 3 things that are clear about the first quarter. First, we anticipate that we would be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment this year. And that's what we saw in the first quarter. Economic conditions around the world are choppy, and diverging monetary policies are creating fluctuations in currencies. Second, even with these challenges, our growth businesses grew close to double digits, excluding the impact of currency. And finally, unlike the first quarter of last year where we executed very well, our first quarter of 2015 was a more typical start to the year.
Turning to our 3 strategic initiatives. First, stabilizing our mail business. Our enterprise mail businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our SMB business in North America performed consistent with the last several quarters. If you double click on that business, you would find that our new channels in North America Mailing performed very well.
In our field sales organization, we had [ph] a couple of large deals on the table in the public sector. Some of these deals closed in the first few days of April. It's a very good sign that our new channels are beginning to produce strong results. But as we expected, our SMB business in Europe experienced some disruptions in sales activity as a result of our go-to-market changes.
Second, we continued our focus on operational excellence. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 220 basis points. EBIT margins increased and we continued to reduce our debt levels. Again, importantly, we did this while making significant investments in the business. Let me add one more comment here. We continued to improve our debt-to-EBITDA levels, which gives us more flexibility making capital allocation decisions.
Finally, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. Our growth in our ecommerce business slowed due to the strong dollar, continued to grow and helped propel growth in our overall Digital Commerce business. Software license revenue continued to grow and our marketing services business performed very, very well.
One last point about our Digital Commerce Solutions business. One of our strategic opportunities, that is truly our software products, grew our SMB channel. Last year, we began to pursue this opportunity aggressively. In the first quarter of 2015, our shipping business began to make real progress. More on this as the year unfolds.
All in all, we are continuing to execute our plan against a relatively choppy environment. The first quarter provides continued evidence that we are on the right track and we are reaffirming our guidance for 2015. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike to take you through a more detailed view of our first quarter results."
297018,290733167,798647,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning.

Adjusting for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year, revenue was flat. We were able to grow EBIT 5% and improved EBIT margins to 20% for our operational excellence efforts.
Despite a higher tax rate and currency impacts, we delivered earnings per share in line with our expectations. Changes in currencies are having a significant impact on reported results for global companies. While our international exposure is not as great as other companies, we're not immune to the effects, particularly of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or nearly 4% and our earnings per share by $0.01. As Marc referenced, we did see positive results in many areas of the business. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue growth was still solid this quarter. EBIT expanded nicely despite the strengthening U.S. dollar's dampening effect on our ecommerce package volumes from the U.S. and the slower rate of Software revenue growth.
Our Presort Services business continued to grow both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail revenue was flat, excluding the changes in currency and EBIT margin was also improved. Our North American Mailing business continue to have trends in line with the prior 3 quarters for revenue, and EBIT margin continued to improve year-over-year. We experienced some disruption in our European mailing equipment sales, particularly in France as we transitioned our go-to-market model there.
As a reminder, last year, we announced that we exited a non-core product line in Norway and moved to a dealer network in 6 smaller European markets. Note that these strategic actions were not reclassified as discontinued operations. As a result, our year-over-year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by 1% on a consolidated basis and at the total SMB level and by nearly 5% in International Mailing.
In order to properly understand our underlying operational results, it's important to take the impacts of currency and our strategic actions in Europe into consideration. Where appropriate, I'll address the impacts to growth rates of both factors.
Let me now take you through the details of our income statement and then I'll review our business segment results. As a reminder, the company's first quarter earnings related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $891 million, which was a decline of 1% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Total revenue was flat to the prior year when both periods are adjusted for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues, revenue grew 9% in Digital Commerce Solutions, grew 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 5% in SMB Solutions.
On a reported basis, revenue grew 6% in Digital Commerce Solutions, was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 11% in SMB Solutions, reflecting the significant impact of currency during the quarter. When compared to the prior year, our SG&A declined $22 million on a constant currency basis and $37 million on a reported basis. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by about 220 basis points as we remain focused on streamlining our operations and being more efficient. Investment in our new ERP system and our marketing expenses increased over prior year by about $4 million.
Due to some timing issues particularly related to marketing spend, we now expect these expenses to be at the highest in the second and the third quarters of this year. When we initially provided guidance in February, we anticipated these expenses would be greater in the first half of the year.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $43 million, which was a decline of about $1 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $178 million, growth of 5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 150 basis points.
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $221 million, growth of 3% versus prior year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 37.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year. Last year's tax rate included a favorable resolution of certain tax matters that resulted in a $6 million tax benefit. The higher tax rate this quarter is partially due to charges related to the expiration of certain stock options and a greater percentage of revenue from U.S. operations.
Turning to earnings per share. Despite the challenging economic environment and lower revenue, we were still able to deliver solid EBIT growth and earnings per share in line with our expectations. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.40 compared to $0.42 in the prior year. Currency had a $0.01 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter. Additionally, the higher tax rate this quarter negatively impacted EPS by about $0.03 per share when compared to the midpoint of the range for our expected tax rate on an annualized basis. We still expect the tax rate for the full year to be in our original guidance range of 31% to 34%.
Looking at free cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $85 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $104 million in cash from operations. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was lower this quarter, primarily due to the timing of accounts payable and higher capital expenditures related to the company's ERP implementation.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3.1 billion of debt, which was about $177 million lower than the prior year, and we had $913 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $157 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.4%, which was about flat to the prior year.
During the quarter, we returned $38 million of cash to our common shareholders in the form of dividends and we made $22 million of restructuring payments. Also during the quarter, we redeemed $275 million of debt that matured in March through use of $175 million in cash on the balance sheet and $100 million in commercial paper.
Turning to our business segment results. In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $362 million and EBIT was $164 million. Revenue declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis while EBIT increased 2%. Revenue for the quarter was consistent with the prior 3 quarters' results. Recurring revenue stream trends were in line with prior quarters, driven primarily by financing revenue, which declined less than 1% and continued stabilization of rentals revenue.
In the U.S., equipment sales declined at a mid-single digit rate compared to a relatively strong first quarter of 2014, which was just prior to the significant channel resources shift as part of the go-to-market strategy. We expect the trend for equipment sales to improve as the initial go-to-market changes begin to annualize. EBIT margin was 45.2%, which was an improvement of 310 basis points versus the prior year, driven by savings from our go-to-market implementation as well as other ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $116 million and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 12% on a constant currency basis and 24% on a reported basis. Excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier, revenue declined 7%.
During the quarter, we ramped up the implementation of our go-to-market strategy throughout Europe. This transition was first completed in the U.K. in January, which had positive revenue growth during the quarter and is now complete in Germany. However, in France, our second largest market in Europe, we are still in the early notification and consultation stages of the proposed go-to-market transition, which has significantly impacted sales productivity there.
Lower sales in France account for a large portion of the International Mailing revenue decline after the impacts of currency and the divested revenues. EBIT margin was 10.1%, which was a decline of 610 basis points versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenue performance and the impact of currency on some supply chain costs.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $100 million and EBIT was $9 million. Revenue was flat on a constant currency basis and declined 5% on a reported basis. Excluding the currency and the divested revenues in Europe related to this segment, revenue would have grown 1%. Equipment sales grew as a result of a larger number of inserting equipment installations during the quarter. Supplies revenue continued to benefit from the growth in production print installations in 2014.
Support services revenue declined as a result of some in-house mailers shipping their mail processing to third-party outsourcers who provide some self-service on equipment. EBIT margin was 9.1%, which was an improvement of 170 basis points versus the prior year, due to higher mix of inserting equipment and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $27 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the addition of new customers and an increase in the volume of mail processed. EBIT margin was 22.6%, which was an improvement of 210 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
For the Digital Commerce Solutions segment, revenue was $192 million and EBIT was $16 million. Revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, the segment continued to deliver revenue growth in ecommerce, Shipping Solutions and Marketing Services. Software revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. Ecommerce's revenue growth was driven in part by a continued increase on the number of packages shipped but did also reflect the unfavorable impacts of a stronger U.S. dollar on the number of purchases outbound from the U.S. Ecommerce also achieved continued expansion in its U.K. outbound cross-border services.
Marketing services and shipping solutions revenue continued to grow as a result of new client addition for the respective product offerings. Software license revenue increased at a high single digit rate on a constant currency basis but was offset by lower professional services and maintenance revenue when compared to the prior year.
EBIT margin was 8.3%, which was an improvement of 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin improved even as the company continued to invest in development activities and infrastructure in ecommerce and software solutions.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company.
We are reaffirming our annual guidance for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of flat to 3% growth on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share are still expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $2. And free cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $475 million to $550 million for the year.
As I noted when I originally gave guidance in February, currency exchange rates could reduce reported revenues versus constant currency revenue by more than 3 percentage points on an annual basis. EPS could also be adversely impacted by about $0.04 to $0.06 per share on an annual basis. Additionally, the actions completed in the third quarter of 2014 to exit the noncore product line in Norway and transition to a dealer sales network in 6 smaller European markets are expected to adversely impact total revenue comparisons for 2015 by about $30 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, equaling about 1% on an annual basis.
As I mentioned last quarter, 2015 represents a critical third year in our business transformation. It is the peak year for investment as we complete our major go-to-market initiatives internationally, continue the buildout of our ERP program and increase investment in our brand and marketing to build greater awareness of our unique capabilities.
We originally anticipated that the investment in these areas would be more heavily weighted in the first half of the year, but the timing and mix for some of these expenses has shifted. We now expect the highest periods of incremental earnings impact when compared to the prior year, with -- more concentrated in the second quarter and third quarter. In the full year, we still expect the incremental expenses related to our ERP program and marketing efforts in the aggregate to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

As I indicated in my remarks, we saw good performance and a different kind of performance in our new channels in the first quarter and we're very gratified by that. We think that's a very good sign. The overall SMB business in North America, ironically, was affected by some large deals that we left in the table with our field sales. So that will happen, some of your large deals, kind of a little flat [ph] from one quarter to another. In International, so in Europe, as you kind of unlayer it, as Mike has indicated for you, you got to look at it on a country basis. We're done in the U.K. I would note, in the U.K., we had good performance not just overall, but as well in our new channels. And again, we see that as a very positive sign. We are done in Germany. Germany performed as we would have expected, given the disruptions. And I would say we are in the early innings in France in terms of working our way through the process with the works councils. Importantly, we have begun the process in Asia. So I would say, you have to look at this now on a country-by-country basis. In a couple of majors in Europe, we're done. France will take some bit of time to work our way through, and we're going through the process in Asia."

And I would say the other geographies are coming up the curve. So -- but to your point, I mean, these are still relatively new channels. So if you think about putting the new channel in place in substance over 12 or 18 months and getting reasonable performance, I find that to be a very important point of evidence."

We probably saw a little bit more capitalization of ERP in the first quarter than we had baked into our original outlook. But all in all, the program continues to be within our overall roadmap for it in terms of total spend. This is really more just a timing shift, with the concentration of that being more so in the second, third quarter."

But certainly, we saw some of them come in early in the year. So the key drivers behind bringing that closer to level is equipment sales. We saw very good performance again in recurring revenue streams. Financing income down just 1%. Actually, it's slightly less than 1%. Rental comparisons continued to improve. So I think as marc outlined, the channel maturity is really the key driver to that as we go forward. And in the first quarter, that inside sales, what Marc referred to as the new channels, achieved our objectives in the quarter. So we continue to move in the right direction. And obviously, this is the last quarter since we've made the big changes last year. So we begin to have comparisons on an apples-to-apples basis going forward."

The -- what Marc outlined really are the 3 big ones, right, the U.K., France and Germany. The U.K. transitioned through that well. If you take all the noise out of the system, in other words, look at the International Mailing revenue performance this quarter, nearly half of it was currency related. And then another 5 percentage points were -- was related to the comparison for the businesses that we exited last year. That gets you down to a negative 7%. Most all of that was related to Germany in terms of their -- I'm sorry, to France, related to their comparison year-over-year. So if you look at a very low single digit, 1% or 2% decline year-over-year x those factors, that's very much in the range of the performance of plus or minus 2% we've seen in Europe over the last several quarters, if not several years. And so we think the impacts are fairly isolated. We know what we have left to complete in that process. Other markets beyond those big 3 become quite a bit smaller. Once you get past U.K., France, Germany and in North America, Canada as an international market which is already through the process as well, then the rest are relatively small. We don't expect big measurable impacts from them going through the transformation."

I mean, we grew high single digits in constant currency at a license level in the first quarter. That's off of the fourth quarter. We think we did 20% or 30% in terms of license revenue.

We have a newer leadership team outside of North America. I mean, I would expect as those leaders get in place, they will we'll continue to make judgments about what they need to do.

In terms of potential acquisitions, I know you wouldn't, Shannon, think [ph] -- and I would portray a particular thought beyond saying that each of the product businesses now and Software have gone through their 5-year product road maps, have a very clear view of the capabilities that they need in order to retain leadership, are in the process now of making made [ph] versus buy decisions. I would reiterate that all of that needs to be in the context of total shareholder return. So we've set for ourselves some very stringent criteria around acquisitions in terms of IRR and when they need to be accretive and et cetera. So that's kind of where we are, and moving in, [ph] we'll continue to execute. I would say, again, people often ask me, do you see the need for a transformational type of acquisition?

And our first quarter results reinforce the underlying strength of our business model and the strategy to unlock value in our company.Earnings before in",598,"Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. 2015 is a very important year in our transformation. And our first quarter results reinforce the underlying strength of our business model and the strategy to unlock value in our company.
Earnings before interest and taxes grew 5%, 7% if you adjust for currency. We grew our EBIT even as we made substantial investments in our systems, our brand and our product development. Our first quarter results were affected by currency fluctuations, divestitures not accounted for in discontinued operations and the higher-than-usual tax rate.
The impact of the strong dollar took almost 4 points off of revenue and divestitures reduced revenue by a little less than 1 point. We expect our tax rate to return to more normal levels later in the year and in the second half of the year, that currency impacts will begin to wrap assuming the dollar stays at the current level.
There are 3 things that are clear about the first quarter. First, we anticipated that we would be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment this year and that's what we saw in the first quarter. Economic conditions around the world are choppy, and diverging monetary policies are creating fluctuations in currencies. Second, even with these challenges, our growth businesses grew close to double digits, excluding the impact of currency. And finally, unlike the first quarter of last year, where we executed very well, our first quarter of 2015 was a more typical start to the year.
Turning to our 3 strategic initiatives. First, stabilizing our mail business. Our enterprise mail businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our SMB business in North America performed consistent with the last several quarters. If you double click on that business, you would find that our new channels in North America Mailing performed very well.
In our field sales organization, we left a couple of large deals on the table in the public sector. Some of these deals closed in the first few days of April. It's a very good sign that our new channels are beginning to produce strong results. But as we expected, our SMB business in Europe experienced some disruptions in sales activity as a result of our go-to-market changes.
Second, we continued our focus on operational excellence. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 220 basis points. EBIT margins increased and we continued to reduce our debt levels. Again, importantly, we did this while making significant investments in the business. Let me add one more comment here. We continued to improve our debt-to-EBITDA levels, which gives us more flexibility making capital allocation decisions.
Finally, growing our business through expansion in Digital Commerce. Our growth in our ecommerce business, slowed due to the strong dollar, continued to grow and helped propel growth in our overall Digital Commerce business. Software license revenue continued to grow and our marketing services business performed very, very well.
One last point about our Digital Commerce Solutions business. One of our strategic opportunities is to distribute our software products through our SMB channel. Last year, we began to pursue this opportunity aggressively. In the first quarter of 2015, our shipping business began to make real progress. More on this as the year unfolds.
All in all, we are continuing to execute our plan against a relatively choppy environment. The first quarter provides continued evidence that we are on the right track and we are reaffirming our guidance for 2015. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike to take you through a more detailed view of our first quarter results."

Adjusting for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year, revenue was flat. We were able to grow EBIT 5% and improved EBIT margins to 20% for our operational excellence efforts.
Despite a higher tax rate and currency impacts, we delivered earnings per share in line with our expectations. Changes in currencies are having a significant impact on reported results for global companies. While our international exposure is not as great as other companies, we're not immune to the effects, particularly of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or nearly 4% and our earnings per share by $0.01. As Marc referenced, we did see positive results in many areas of the business. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue growth was still solid this quarter. EBIT expanded nicely despite the strengthening U.S. dollar's dampening effect on our ecommerce package volumes from the U.S. and the slower rate of Software revenue growth.
Our Presort Services business continued to grow both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail revenue was flat, excluding the changes in currency and EBIT margin was also improved. Our North American Mailing business continued to have trends in line with the prior 3 quarters for revenue, and EBIT margin continued to improve year-over-year. We experienced some disruption in our European mailing equipment sales, particularly in France as we transitioned our go-to-market model there.
As a reminder, last year, we announced that we exited a non-core product line in Norway and moved to a dealer network in 6 smaller European markets. Note that these strategic actions were not reclassified as discontinued operations. As a result, our year-over-year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by 1% on a consolidated basis and at the total SMB level and by nearly 5% in International Mailing.
In order to properly understand our underlying operational results, it's important to take the impacts of currency and our strategic actions in Europe into consideration. Where appropriate, I'll address the impacts to growth rates of both factors.
Let me now take you through the details of our income statement and then I'll review our business segment results. As a reminder, the company's first quarter earnings related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $891 million, which was a decline of 1% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Total revenue was flat to the prior year when both periods are adjusted for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues, revenue grew 9% in Digital Commerce Solutions, grew 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 5% in SMB Solutions.
On a reported basis, revenue grew 6% in Digital Commerce Solutions, was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 11% in SMB Solutions, reflecting the significant impact of currency during the quarter. When compared to the prior year, our SG&A declined $22 million on a constant currency basis and $37 million on a reported basis. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by about 220 basis points as we remain focused on streamlining our operations and being more efficient. Investment in our new ERP system and our marketing expenses increased over prior year by about $4 million.
Due to some timing issues particularly related to marketing spend, we now expect these expenses to be at the highest in the second and the third quarters of this year. When we initially provided guidance in February, we anticipated these expenses would be greater in the first half of the year.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $43 million, which was a decline of about $1 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $178 million, growth of 5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 150 basis points.
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $221 million, growth of 3% versus prior year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 37.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year. Last year's tax rate included a favorable resolution of certain tax matters that resulted in a $6 million tax benefit. The higher tax rate this quarter is partially due to charges related to the expiration of certain stock options and a greater percentage of revenue from U.S. operations.
Turning to earnings per share. Despite the challenging economic environment and lower revenue, we were still able to deliver solid EBIT growth and earnings per share in line with our expectations. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.40 compared to $0.42 in the prior year. Currency had a $0.01 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter. Additionally, the higher tax rate this quarter negatively impacted EPS by about $0.03 per share when compared to the midpoint of the range for our expected tax rate on an annualized basis. We still expect the tax rate for the full year to be in our original guidance range of 31% to 34%.
Looking at free cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $85 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $104 million in cash from operations. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was lower this quarter, primarily due to the timing of accounts payable and higher capital expenditures related to the company's ERP implementation.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3.1 billion of debt, which was about $177 million lower than the prior year, and we had $913 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $157 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.4%, which was about flat to the prior year.
During the quarter, we returned $38 million of cash to our common shareholders in the form of dividends and we made $22 million of restructuring payments. Also during the quarter, we redeemed $275 million of debt that matured in March through use of $175 million in cash on the balance sheet and $100 million in commercial paper.
Turning to our business segment results. In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $362 million and EBIT was $164 million. Revenue declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis while EBIT increased 2%. Revenue for the quarter was consistent with the prior 3 quarters' results. Recurring revenue stream trends were in line with prior quarters, driven primarily by financing revenue, which declined less than 1% and continued stabilization of rentals revenue.
In the U.S., equipment sales declined at a mid-single digit rate compared to a relatively strong first quarter of 2014, which was just prior to the significant channel resources shift as part of the go-to-market strategy. We expect the trend for equipment sales to improve as the initial go-to-market changes begin to annualize. EBIT margin was 45.2%, which was an improvement of 310 basis points versus the prior year, driven by savings from our go-to-market implementation as well as other ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $116 million and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 12% on a constant currency basis and 24% on a reported basis. Excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier, revenue declined 7%.
During the quarter, we ramped up the implementation of our go-to-market strategy throughout Europe. This transition was first completed in the U.K. in January, which had positive revenue growth during the quarter and is now complete in Germany. However, in France, our second largest market in Europe, we are still in the early notification and consultation stages of the proposed go-to-market transition, which has significantly impacted sales productivity there.
Lower sales in France account for a large portion of the International Mailing revenue decline after the impacts of currency and the divested revenues. EBIT margin was 10.1%, which was a decline of 610 basis points versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenue performance and the impact of currency on some supply chain costs.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $100 million and EBIT was $9 million. Revenue was flat on a constant currency basis and declined 5% on a reported basis. Excluding the currency and the divested revenues in Europe related to this segment, revenue would have grown 1%. Equipment sales grew as a result of a larger number of inserting equipment installations during the quarter. Supplies revenue continued to benefit from the growth in production print installations in 2014.
Support services revenue declined as a result of some of in-house mailers shipping their mail processing to third-party outsourcers who provide some self-service on equipment. EBIT margin was 9.1%, which was an improvement of 170 basis points versus the prior year, due to higher mix of inserting equipment and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $27 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the addition of new customers and an increase in the volume of mail processed. EBIT margin was 22.6%, which was an improvement of 210 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
For the Digital Commerce Solutions segment, revenue was $192 million and EBIT was $16 million. Revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, the segment continued to deliver revenue growth in ecommerce, Shipping Solutions and Marketing Services. Software revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. Ecommerce's revenue growth was driven in part by a continued increase on the number of packages shipped but did also reflect the unfavorable impacts of a stronger U.S. dollar on the number of purchases outbound from the U.S. Ecommerce also achieved continued expansion in its U.K. outbound cross-border services.
Marketing services and shipping solutions revenue continued to grow as a result of new client addition for the respective product offerings. Software license revenue increased at a high single digit rate on a constant currency basis but was offset by lower professional services and maintenance revenue when compared to the prior year.
EBIT margin was 8.3%, which was an improvement of 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin improved even as the company continued to invest in development activities and infrastructure in ecommerce and software solutions.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company.
We are reaffirming our annual guidance for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of flat to 3% growth on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share are still expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $2. And free cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $475 million to $550 million for the year.
As I noted when I originally gave guidance in February, currency exchange rates could reduce reported revenues versus constant currency revenue by more than 3 percentage points on an annual basis. EPS could also be adversely impacted by about $0.04 to $0.06 per share on an annual basis. Additionally, the actions completed in the third quarter of 2014 to exit the noncore product line in Norway and transition to a dealer sales network in 6 smaller European markets are expected to adversely impact total revenue comparisons for 2015 by about $30 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, equaling about 1% on an annual basis.
As I mentioned last quarter, 2015 represents a critical third year in our business transformation. It is the peak year for investment as we complete our major go-to-market initiatives internationally, continue the buildout of our ERP program and increase investment in our brand and marketing to build greater awareness of our unique capabilities.
We originally anticipated that the investment in these areas would be more heavily weighted in the first half of the year, but the timing and mix for some of these expenses has shifted. We now expect the highest periods of incremental earnings impact, when compared to the prior year, would be more concentrated in the second quarter and third quarter. In the full year, we still expect the incremental expenses related to our ERP program and marketing efforts, in the aggregate, to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

As I indicated in my remarks, we saw good performance and a different kind of performance in our new channels in the first quarter and we're very gratified by that. We think that's a very good sign. The overall SMB business in North America, ironically, was affected by some large deals that we left on the table with our field sales. So that will happen, some of your large deals kind of will flop from one quarter to another. In International, so in Europe, if you kind of unlayer it, as Mike has indicated for you, you got to look at it on a country basis. We're done in the U.K. I would note, in the U.K., we had good performance not just overall, but as well in our new channels. And again, we see that as a very positive sign. We are done in Germany. Germany performed as we would have expected, given the disruptions. And I would say we are in the early innings in France in terms of working our way through the process with the works councils. Importantly, we have begun the process in Asia. So I would say, you have to look at this now at a country-by-country basis. In a couple of the majors in Europe, we're done. France will take some bit of time to work our way through, and we're going through the process in Asia."

And I would say the other geographies are coming up the curve. So -- but to your point, I mean, these are still relatively new channels.

We probably saw a little bit more capitalization of ERP in the first quarter than we had baked into our original outlook. But all in all, the program continues to be within our overall roadmap for it in terms of total spend. This is really more just a timing shift, with the concentration of that being more so in the second, third quarter."

But certainly, we saw some of them come in early in the year. So the key drivers behind bringing that closer to level is equipment sales. We saw very good performance again in recurring revenue streams. Financing income down just 1%. Actually, it's slightly less than 1%. Rental comparisons continued to improve. So I think as Marc outlined, the channel maturity is really the key driver to that as we go forward. And in the first quarter, that inside sales, what Marc referred to as the new channels, achieved our objectives in the quarter. So we continue to move in the right direction. And obviously, this is the last quarter since we've made the big changes last year, so we begin to have comparisons on an apples-to-apples basis going forward."

The U.K., France and Germany. The U.K. transitioned through that well. If you take all the noise out of the system, in other words, look at the International Mailing revenue performance this quarter, nearly half of it was currency related. And then another 5 percentage points were -- was related to the comparison for the businesses that we exited last year. That gets you down to a negative 7%. Most all of that was related to Germany in terms of their -- I'm sorry, to France, related to their comparison year-over-year. So if you look at a very low single digit, 1% or 2% decline year-on-year x those factors, that's very much in the range of the performance of plus or minus 2% we've seen in Europe over the last several quarters, if not several years. And so we think the impacts are fairly isolated. We know what we have left to complete in that process. Other markets beyond those big 3 become quite a bit smaller. Once you get past U.K., France, Germany and in North America, Canada as an international market which is already through the process as well, then the rest are relatively small.

I mean, we grew high single digits in constant currency at a license level in the first quarter. That's off of the fourth quarter where I think we grew 20% or 30% in terms of the license revenue.

We have a newer leadership team outside of North America. I mean, I would expect as those leaders get in place, they will we'll continue to make judgments about what they need to do. So I mean, I would say that business has come long way in a couple of years. The Software business, by definition, is a little bit lumpy. So it will ebb and flow at the course of the year. We will have large transactions that can make a difference in a given quarter, and we'll continue to look over through those quarters. In terms of potential acquisitions, I know you wouldn't, Shannon, think that I would portray a particular thought beyond saying that each of the product businesses now and Software have gone through their 5-year product road maps, have a very clear view of the capabilities that they need in order to retain leadership, are in the process now of making -- make versus buy decisions. I would reiterate that all of that needs to be in the context of total shareholder return. So we've set for ourselves some very stringent criteria around acquisitions in terms of IRR and when they need to be accretive and et cetera. So that's kind of where we are and will be, and we'll continue to execute. I would say, again, people often ask me, do you see the need for a transformational type of acquisition? I like the spaces we're in and I think there's plenty of opportunity to execute in the domains that we've chosen."

We're in a multi-year journey to transform this company. And while we made significant progress in the last 30 months, we've have a heck of a lot more to do. I closed our year-end conference in February by saying that it's hard to know precisely what 2015 was going to bring. I think that's turned out to be true. I don't think it was particularly prescient at that time, but it is a choppy market environment.
I also said, however, that I like our position. I like the handle [ph] that we've got. I like the opportunities that are in front of us. And importantly, we're not building this company for a quarter or for even a year. We're mindful that we've been around for 95 years, and we're really trying to create the foundation for our future and to build a bridge not just for the next 5 years, but to our second century. We're going to move forward in a very disciplined focus. You see that in our results. You see it in how we manage expense. You see it in how we manage capital.

Earlier this year, I told you that 2015 was going to be a pivotal year in our transformation. I also told you that we will move forward with the same disciplined focus required for the long-term success of the company. The objective of our transformation has been, and continues to be, to create long-term value. In the second quarter, we took several actions to transform Pitney Bowes and to create value. We closed on the sale of world headquarters building and also closed on a sale of our market and services business. Both of these transactions are clear evidence of our disciplined focus to unlock the value of our business and to be good stewards of our shareholders capital.
In the case of our marketing services business, it was and is a great business. It fits with our overall portfolio but simply worth more to Red Ventures than it was to us. This is a clear demonstration of the kinds of action we will take in order to create value for our shareholders.
On the other side of the ledger, and I'll come back to this later in my comments, we acquired Borderfree. Borderfree is a perfect fit with our ecommerce business, and is highly synergistic. Moreover, it positions Pitney Bowes as a clear leader in a fast-growing, multibillion-dollar market place. The actions which we took, which builds on the work we did during the previous years, have strengthened our hand and improved our competitive position in key markets and made us more focused and more efficient. As a result, we are now at an inflection point in our transformation. Accumulative of the facts of the steps we have taken over the past 3 months will begin to feel sustained, long-term growth and profitability.
In terms of the second quarter, Mike will give you specific details but I will characterize the results as mixed. Our Presort business continues to perform very well. Our North American SMB business continues to improve, and our North American Software business executed well. Conversely, our ecommerce business growth rates were negatively affected by the strong dollar and I would say our overall performance in Europe was below what we had expected. And in general, the strong dollar continues to have a negative impact on our top and bottom-line. In the near term, the progress we made in the first half of the year sets us up for improved performance in the second half. As for the longer-term, we will talk more about that, at our Analyst Day in September.
Let me now comment on the progress of our long-term strategic initiatives. First, the stabilization of our Mail business. In the second quarter, the decline of our SMB business continued to moderate and is now approaching the levels of performance we're experiencing before we adjusted our go-to-market, albeit with a much more efficient and effective expense structure. We expect to see continued progress in our North America SMB business in the second half of the year. Likewise, the progress we have made in our North American SMB business reaffirms our conviction that we're on the right track with the changes we have made in Europe although clearly the changes have caused temporary disruptions.
Also of note, we made an important product announcement. On July 15, we announced relay multichannel communication fleet. Relay is a major step forward in providing small and medium businesses with an integrated solution that creates communications for both digital and physical channels. This product announcement is more than it may seem on first blush for a couple of reasons. First, this product announcement is an example of innovation in our legacy business. This announcement is the first of several we are planning. Second, and perhaps even more importantly, this is a great example of taking our digital capabilities and in driving them into our legacy business and ultimately, our $1.5 million plans. Initial responses from our clients from around the world had been very positive and we believe this product will provide a lift to our business in the second half of the year. More and more, our focus is how we make our individual businesses accretive to one another. Much more on this as we get to Analyst Day.
Second, our continued effort to drive operational excellence into our business. As I've always said, operational excellence is only important if you can find the evidence in your balance sheet, your income statement or your work with clients. We are seeing progress in all of these measures. Our SG&A as a percent of revenue, continues to improve in the second quarter, and debt levels were $245 million lower than the year ago. The net of this is our gross and net margins continued to improve towards historically high levels. Also of note, we moved 2 layers of management in structure in our European SMB business. We believe these actions to reduce bureaucracy, improve our speed and accountability, and obviously, will reduce our overall expense structure.
Finally, we continue to make progress on our systems projects. We exited important phase of our systems test, and entered into the next phase of testing with a focus on implementing in Canada later this year. This project will provide substantial benefits to our business, unlock value and provide the right platform to better serve our clients. The net impact of all of these changes is that we are dramatically simplifying our business, in building an effective and efficient platform for growth.
Finally, growing our business through Digital Commerce. The big highlight in the second quarter for this strategic initiative was the acquisition of Borderfree. Mike will give you the specifics but this is one of the most exciting acquisitions I have been involved with. Borderfree has developed great capabilities for e-tellers, and coupled with our best-of-class capabilities for e-marketplaces, the 2 businesses are highly synergistic. In addition to providing a more complete capabilities to the market, there are substantial synergies with the respective costs and expense structures. Going forward, we have best-of-class capabilities, first mover advantage in a multibillion-dollar marketplace growing at double-digit plus rates. Again, we will talk more about this business at Analyst Day.
And once again, our Shipping Software business had a good quarter, growing at double-digit rates, we're using our SMB channel to sell the Software product. Another example of how we use our capabilities in 1 business to make another business better. 1 business being accretive to another business, and using our goal with distribution to take our product quickly around the world.
Also in the second quarter, we made a smaller transaction, screen. This acquisition was within our communications engagement Software business. We acquired a small company that does personalized video billing. The acquisition increases the attractive of our core business provides a very important capability to businesses that are creating bills. The short-term result have been very encouraging. We have built a strong pipeline around the world, and this is a great example of finding capabilities that's accretive to our core business.
Our software business had mixed results in the quarter. We did have a difficult appears and at a few large transactions last year in the second quarter. In the second quarter of this year, we did not have the benefits of particularly large deals and our Software business in Europe performed below our expectations. I expect these dynamics to improve in the fourth quarter.
Finally, one last comment on our marketing services business. At one level, it would have been easier to retain these business. It was a good business fit. We made substantial improvements to our business in the last 2 years, and was clearly helping our top and bottom-line. That said, as stewards of our shareholders capital, selling this business was the right thing to do.
Today, we're also updating our guidance to balance the stronger outlook for the second half with results to the first half of the year. A key reason for our first step outcome was the impact currency had on our ecommerce business. We expected disruptions to be temporary and we are very encouraged by the deals we have signed since April and the pipeline for the second half of the year. Bottom line, we expect the currency issues to stabilize in this business to be back on the growth path going forward.
Therefore, we're adjusting our full year revenue guidance to minus-1 to plus-1. Michael will provide greater detail on our second-half outlook in his remarks. The important point is we will always choose the creation of long-term shareholder value over the more expedient path.
So let me summarize. Will characterize the second quarter into an extent, the first half results as mixed. We do believe the second half of the year will be on a much different track, and most importantly, we will continue to take the actions that drive long-term value to our shareholders. We have not and will not take the expedient path to optimize our quarter or even a year. It will certainly be easier to avoid making the necessary investments in our systems, investments in our brands, we'll go disruptions go-to-market protect to protect the quarter or to retain a business that was contributing to our quarter results. Management team the story, for this company is all about.
As we move to the back half of this transformation, the value and the benefits of our work is clearly in sight and my conviction and resolve about our path going forward is stronger than ever.
I will now turn the pudding to Mike."

As Mark noted, we are now at an inflection poin",2986,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning. As we've said when we originally provided guidance, 2015 is a transition year in the company's major transformation to unlock additional value for shareholders and clients. As Mark noted, we are now at an inflection point in the business.
During the quarter, we completed 2 significant transactions, closed a number of open items, continued to streamline operations and we saw our North American mailing revenue further stabilize as a result of our go to market changes. Accordingly, I'll spend a little more time this quarter delayering our results to clarify our operational progress and how we are positioned for an improving outlook beginning in the second half of the year.
During the first half of this year, we remain focused on 3 key objectives: to stabilize mail, grow Digital Commerce and improve operational excellence. In North American mailing, we experienced a slowing rate of decline in revenue, which was the lowest rate of decline in the last 5 quarters. Because of this trend and as the sales force becomes more productive, we have higher confidence of continued improvement in revenue trends for this segment going forward. Globally, the go-to-market transition is complete in most of our major markets. We are now implementing our transition in France. We expect these markets to improve in line with our North American experience. Additionally, we've completed several changes in our geographic footprint to exit low margin countries, the impacts of which will annualize in the second half of this year. We will continue to evaluate the best markets to maintain our direct business presence. As result of these and several other actions, we have taken -- we have significantly reduced our cost structure throughout the business, which is improve the company's overall margins while at the same time, helping us to operate more efficiently. We have yet to recognize the full benefits of some of these initiatives.
While we are seeing SG&A benefits of go-to-market changes across the portfolio, we intend to leverage these new selling capabilities with the new value propositions. Over the past several weeks and months, we have brought to market several new products and services across our businesses that allow us to bring our technologies and platforms the different segments of our client base. As Marc mentioned, we recently launched a SaaS-based SMB relay communications hub, which leverages our Production Mail document security capabilities and also introduced our personal interactive video solutions for high-volume mailer. We'll discuss this and other product plans further at our Analyst Day on September 16.
We've also taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio, focusing on high-growth opportunities in the global digital congress markets. We exited our marketing services business for which we got good value and reinvested the proceeds in Borderfree, which significantly enhances our capabilities and positioning in cross-border ecommerce. In addition to our operational progress, we resolved a couple of open items. We sold our former world headquarters building, freeing up approximately $40 million of capital and reached the settlement and principal to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the Department of Justice.
We have also made substantial progress on our ERP program and our preparing for an initial pilot. We accomplished a lot in the second quarter. Our path forward is clear on how we will improve our operational performance. Additionally, we have a stable capital structure that gives us flexibility in our capital allocation decisions.
So with that, let me break down our second quarter results for you. Once again, currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year had a meaningful impact on a comparison of our reported results for the quarter. During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $36 million or 4%, and our earnings per share by nearly $0.02. Year-to-date, currency reduced revenue by $71 million and earnings per share by $0.03. These impacts are a result of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last year. Beyond the translation effects, currency also continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our ecommerce business. Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions in Europe from last year adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by more than $12 million or about 1%. Adjusting for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year, revenue would have declined about 3%. This headwinds will annualized in the second half of the year.
Let me now take you through the details of our income statement and then I'll review our business segment results. As a reminder, the company's second quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website. Also note, we revised our segment reporting to reflect how we are now operating the company. The Digital Commerce solutions segment group is now comprised of our software solutions and global ecommerce segments. The global ecommerce segment results include our cross-border and shipping businesses. A new segment called Other, includes the results of our recently divested marketing services business. All other segments remain unchanged. This will enhance investors ability to follow the performance of our key Digital Commerce growth initiatives going forward. The reclassified segment reporting on a historical basis, can also be found on our Investor Relations website.
Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter totaled $881 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. Total revenue declined 3% compared to the prior year when adjusted for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year. On a constant-currency basis, and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 4% in SMB solutions and 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 4% in Digital Commerce solutions, driven by growth in global ecommerce. Revenue declined 26% in the Other segment as the result of the sale of marketing services during the quarter. Reported revenue, including the significant impact of currency during the quarter, declined 11% in SMB solutions, 5% in Enterprise Business Solutions and was flat in the Digital Commerce solutions and declined 26% in Other.
SG&A this quarter, includes a onetime stock-based compensation charge of $10 million, directly associated with the Borderfree acquisition. SG&A also includes 1 month's worth of amortization of Borderfree-related intangibles of about $1 million. Adjusting for these items, SG&A declined $34 million from the prior year, and as a percent of revenue improved by about 80 basis points. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest was $39 million, which was a decline of more than $3 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $180 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved to 20.4% or a 70 basis points improvement over prior year, despite the inclusion of currency impacts, while also 1 month of income and amortization of Borderfree-related intangibles.
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $223 million. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.5% compared to 33.4% in the prior year. The lower tax rate this quarter is mostly due to the mix in earnings.
Turning to earnings per share. Despite the lower revenue, we were still able to deliver adjusted EBIT margin improvement and earnings per share in line with our expectations. GAAP earnings per share was $0.75 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.45. Included in adjusted EPS is $0.02 per share of negative impacts from currency. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.44 per share of other income due to the net gain from the sale of words, $0.05 per share of other expense for transaction costs and fees related to the Borderfree and Imatigas transactions and the settlement in principal to resolve a previously disclose the outstanding matter with the Department of Justice. $0.04 per share compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the Borderfree acquisition, and $0.04 per share of the restructuring and asset impairment charges, including the sale of our former world headquarters building. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slide.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $84 million and $96 million on a GAAP-basis. In comparison to the prior year, second quarter free cash flow was lower primarily due to timing of working capital requirements, lower reserve account deposits and less of a decline in finance receivables. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $800 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $319 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.27%, which was flat to the prior year.
During the quarter, we returned $47 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, made $9 million in restructuring payments and received approximately $40 million of cash related to the sale of our former world headquarters building. Also, we have $100 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As share repurchases have become a higher priority in our capital allocation strategy, we expect to begin utilizing this authorization on the third quarter and intend to complete the share repurchases that are currently authorized by the end of the year. Also at the end of the quarter, we continue to have $100 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Turning to our business segment results. In North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $357 million and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined 3% on a constant currency basis and 4% on a reported basis while EBIT increased 2%. The decline in revenue was the lowest rate of decline in 5 quarters, reflecting a continuation of the stabilization and results. Equipment sales declined at a low single digit rate as the disruption from the change in go-to-market subsides and as the sales organization becomes more productive. Recurring revenue streams, trends were in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 44.7% and improved 250 basis points versus the prior year due to continued benefits from the mix of business, organizational streamlining and other ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $111 million and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 15% on a constant currency basis and 28% on a reported basis. Revenue declined 8%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. During the quarter, results continue to be impacted by the implementation of the go to market initiative. With most of our major markets now complete. France is out of consultation and is now implementing its go to market transition.
Revenue comparison was also adversely impacted by the timing of postal rate changes in a number of countries. EBIT margin was 12.8%, which was a decline of 450 basis points versus the prior year, due primarily to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some supply chain costs and the timing of postal rate changes.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $98 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis, and 13% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 6%, excluding currency and the divested revenues in Europe related to this segment. The decline this quarter was due to lower support services revenue and purer equipment sales in Europe and Asia. U.S. equipment sales grew as a result of an increase in the number of inserting equipment installation. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was an improvement of 90 basis points versus the prior year due to favorable geographic mix and higher margin equipment sales as well as ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.
In presort services, revenue for the quarter was $114 million and EBIT was $24 million. Revenue grew 2% on both a constant-currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of first-class mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 20.7%, which was an improvement of 60 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the Software services segment, revenue was $99 million and EBIT was $16 million. Revenue declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. Revenue was impacted by lower licensing and services sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which offset growth and licensing revenue in the Americas. However, as a result of go to market initiatives as well as new product introductions, the business is signing on a larger number of quality midsized deals, which will reduce dependency on onetime large deals and drive new client acquisitions. We are seeing this consistency and efficiencies in the business model playing out in substantially improved profitability in the Software business. This, along with focused cost-reduction initiatives to streamline the operation, resulted in an EBIT margin of 16.3%, which was an improvement of 720 basis points versus the prior year.
For the global ecommerce segment, revenue was $78 million and EBIT was $3 million. Revenue grew 15% on a constant-currency basis and 14% on a reported basis. Revenue include the Borderfree acquisition late in the quarter and expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service. However, outbound packaged shipments from the U.S. continued to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. Shipping solutions revenue continued to strengthen as a result of additional new clients. The shipping business is also benefiting directly from sales improvements in the SMB channel that markets its solutions to small and midsize companies. EBIT margin was 3.9%, which was a decline of 160 basis points from the prior year as a result of ongoing operational costs and integration investments related to the Borderfree acquisition as well as continued investment in the company's cross-border platforms.
Within the Other segment. Revenue was $25 million and EBIT was $6 million. Revenue declined 26% on a constant-currency and reported basis. As a result of the sale of the marketing services business in May, we recognized only 2 months of reported revenue this quarter versus the full quarter of revenue in the prior year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our accomplishment from the second quarter are expected to help drive improved results in the second half of the year. We expect the consolidated revenue growth on a constant-currency basis will improve in the third quarter from the current trends with more significant growth in the fourth quarter, both driven by further stabilization of our mail-related businesses, benefits of new products and services and increased growth in our global ecommerce solutions. The fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from growth in Software Solutions, and the annualization of the impacts of the European market exits in 2014. Based on year-to-date results and our expectations of constant currency growth of 1% to 5% in the second half of the year, we are adjusting our annual revenue guidance to a decline of 1% to growth of 1% when compared to 2014 on a constant-currency basis.
We are increasing annual GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21. This guidance includes the following: $0.44 per share of other income related to the net gain from the sale of Imagitas, $0.05 per share of other expense for the settlement in principle of an outstanding matter with the Department of Justice, and transaction costs and fees related to the Borderfree and Imagitas transaction, and $0.04 per share of restructuring and asset impairment charges, $0.04 per share of compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the Borderfree acquisition, $0.06 per share reduced earnings as a result of the sale of Imagitas, and $0.04 per share of reduced earnings related to the Borderfree, which principally includes amortization of intangibles and integration investments, net of early savings from expected synergies.
We are also updating annual adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance solely to reflect the impacts of the Borderfree acquisition and Imagitas sale. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90. Included in adjusted earnings per share is the assumption that currency will have a $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year.
Free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million. This adjustment of $25 million simply reflects the impact of the Borderfree acquisition and the Imagitas sale. Bottom line, our adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged except for the direct impact of the 2 transactions. While we have included a modest level of synergies this year related to the Borderfree integration, as well as the investments to realize benefits, we are focused in the near term on driving a successful holiday season. That said, we see leverage across these highly complementary ecommerce businesses. We are targeting a run rate synergy benefit of $25 million to $30 million in 18 months through the elimination of public company costs, logistics leverage and the consolidation of infrastructure. We'll provide greater details regarding our ecommerce growth strategy and related growth prospects at our Analyst Day in September.
Again, as Marc and I both noted, we view this quarter as an inflection point. We've taken a number of actions and made decisions that we believe will keep us on track to increase the long-term value of our company. We're confident that our performance, our products and our portfolio actions will deliver on the strategic initiatives we laid out more than 2 years ago.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions."

The amortization, for this -- basically for the 7 months of the year that we would own the business.

The reason we're more -- the reason we are confident in the second half projections really breaks into 2 categories. First of all, from a macro economic perspective, as you look around the world clearly that expectations for higher aging GDP growth inevitably help us. Secondly, we do think some of the effects of currency a lot of that begin stir wrap or stabilize. So you're in presumably a better macroeconomic environment. The part that gives us the most confidence, however, especially within our grasp and then out point to the couple of topics. First of all, as you look at our channel maturation of 4 SMB in North America, as well as Europe,  ex-France, year in another quarter alone, I expect, North America to be more or less kind of in the second half of the year, and Europe SMB, ex-France, again, to be more in line with our long-term expectations in the second half of the year. The pipeline indicates that kind of what we see in the business so far, in the case, that's point 1. Point 2 as it relates to ecommerce, in particular. If you look at the clients that were signed in the second quarter, coupled with what's in the pipeline. You can touch and feel those revenue streams as they come online. So that gives us a high degree of confidence there. And finally, you mentioned the personal video that will help, new product announcements so we got a lot of things that they are in-flight -- currently live that are already out there that will begin to help in the third quarter, and help substantially in the fourth quarter."

Importantly, we didn't predicate those synergies on revenue, topside opportunities, that wasn't because we didn't see them because we wanted to base the synergies on what we could describe with the high degree of confidence. The revenue synergies will come from principally the following: if you think about our respective development and innovation road maps, there was a reasonable amount of overlap and what they were trying to innovate around while you're trying to innovate around. As you go forward, if they will be able to rationalize those prospective development plans, ill be able to innovate even faster in the respective marketplace in those respective marketplaces and retailers so, I think that's, principally, where we see the opportunities.

There was some bright spots in North America SMB, did better. Presort continued to do reasonably well, North America Software business performs reasonably. That being said, I'm balanced, we should have done better, and we are taking actions to improve our execution as we get into the second half of the year. The second point, I think, that's a more important point, is that we really made substantial progress on our long-term strategy in the second quarter. The acquisition of Borderfree, I believe, will be game changing. With a mark up leader, with first mover advantage and a very substantial and fast growing market. Also, worth noting, and we haven't talked a lot about this, but we have a world-class management team in that business right now. That gives me even more confidence, you'll see more about this, but it is something that gives us great optimism. In our SMB business, the new market, approach is settling down. We see clearly within our sights, improvement both in the North American SMB business as well as in International Mailing. Again, that adds up for the long-term, very, very well. Finally, we continue to drive operational excellence and thereby, unlock substantial shareholder value, continue to become more efficient, simplifying our business and rationalizing our portfolio. Significantly, we continue to make real progress with our systems work, and as Mike indicated, the benefits are now clearly in our sights. I said in my prepared remarks, the focus is to create shareholder value and we'll always choose the creation of shareholder value over a more stringent path of protecting the quarter or a year. Plan -- those strategies are necessarily long-term in nature. I've now been at this about 30 months. We describe this as a 3 to 5 year transformation, and you can see as you get to the back half of that transformation the benefits are clearly within our grasp. I, as I said, at the outset, I'm very, very pleased with where we are and our robust transformation, and as I said, the benefits are now at our sights.

Thanks for joining us today. Earlier this year, I told you that 2015 was going to be a pivotal year in our transformation. I also told you that we would move forward with the same disciplined focus required",1633,"Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier this year, I told you that 2015 was going to be a pivotal year in our transformation. I also told you that we would move forward with the same disciplined focus required for the long-term success of the company. The objective of our transformation has been, and continues to be, to create long-term value. 
In the second quarter, we took several actions to transform Pitney Bowes and to create value. We closed on the sale of World Headquarters building and also closed on a sale of our marketing services business. Both of these transactions are clear evidence of our disciplined focus to unlock the value of our business and to be good stewards of our shareholders' capital.
In the case of our marketing services business, it was and is a great business. It fit with our overall portfolio but simply worth more to Red Ventures than it was to us. This is a clear demonstration of the kinds of action we will take in order to create value for our shareholders.
On the other side of the ledger, and I'll come back to this later in my comments, we acquired Borderfree. Borderfree is a perfect fit with our ecommerce business and is highly synergistic. Moreover, it positions Pitney Bowes as a clear leader in a fast-growing, multibillion-dollar market place. The actions which we took which build on the work we did during the previous years have strengthened our hand and improved our competitive position in key markets and made us more focused and more efficient. As a result, we are now at an inflection point in our transformation. The cumulative effects of the steps we have over the past 3 months will begin to fuel sustained long-term growth and profitability.
In terms of the second quarter, Mike will give you specific details, but I will characterize the results as mixed. Our Presort business continued to perform very well. Our North American SMB business continued to improve, and our North American Software business executed well. 
Conversely, our ecommerce business growth rates were negatively affected by the strong dollar, and I would say our overall performance in Europe was below what we had expected. And in general, the strong dollar continues to have a negative impact on our top and our bottom line. In the near term, the progress we made in the first half of the year sets us up for improved performance in the second half. As for the longer term, we will talk more about that at our Analyst Day in September.
Let me now comment on the progress of our long-term strategic initiatives. First, the stabilization of our Mail business. In the second quarter, the decline of our SMB business continued to moderate and is now approaching the levels of performance we're experiencing before we adjusted our go-to-market, albeit with a much more efficient and effective expense structure. We expect to see continued progress in our North American SMB business in the second half of the year. Likewise, the progress we have made in our North American SMB business reaffirms our conviction that we're on the right track with the changes we have made in Europe, although clearly, the changes have caused temporary disruptions.
Also of note, we made an important product announcement. On July 15, we announced  Relay Multi-Channel Communications Suite. Relay is a major step forward in providing small and medium businesses with an integrated solution that creates communications for both digital and physical channels. This product announcement is more than it may seem on first blush for a couple of reasons. 
First, this product announcement is an example of innovation in our legacy business. This announcement is the first of several we are planning. Second, and perhaps even more importantly, it is a great example of taking our digital capabilities and in driving them into our legacy business, and ultimately, our 1.5 million clients. Initial responses from our clients from around the world had been very positive, and we believe this product will provide a lift to our business in the second half of the year. More and more, our focus is how we make our individual businesses accretive to one another. Much more on this as we get to Analyst Day.
Second, our continued effort to drive operational excellence into our business. As I've always said, operational excellence is only important if you can find the evidence in your balance sheet, your income statement or your work with clients. We are seeing progress in all of these measures. Our SG&A as a percent of revenue, continued to improve in the second quarter, and our debt levels were $245 million lower than a year ago. The net of this is our gross and net margins continued to improve towards historically high levels. 
Also of note, we removed 2 layers of management in structure in our European SMB business. We believe these actions will reduce bureaucracy, improve our speed and accountability, and obviously, will reduce our overall expense structure.
Finally, we continue to make progress on our systems projects. We exited an important phase of our systems test and entered into the next phase of testing with a focus on implementing in Canada later this year. This project will provide substantial benefits to our business, unlock value and provide the right platform to better serve our clients. The net impact of all of these changes is that we are dramatically simplifying our business in building an effective and efficient platform for growth.
Finally, growing our business through Digital Commerce. The big highlight from the second quarter for this strategic initiative was the acquisition of Borderfree. Mike will give you the specifics, but this is one of the most exciting acquisitions I have been involved with. 
Borderfree had developed great capabilities for e-tellers, and coupled with our best-of-class capabilities for e-marketplaces, the 2 businesses are highly synergistic. In addition to providing more complete capabilities to the market, there are substantial synergies with the respective costs and expense structures. 
Going forward, we have best-of-class capabilities, first-mover advantage in a multibillion-dollar marketplace growing at double-digit plus rates. Again, we will talk more about this business at Analyst Day.
And once again, our shipping software business had a good quarter, growing at double-digit rates. We're using our SMB channel to sell the software product. This is another example of how we use our capabilities in one business to make another business better, one business being accretive to another business and using our global distribution to take our product quickly around the world. 
Also in the second quarter, we consummated a smaller transaction that probably flew under the radar screen. This acquisition was within our communications engagement software business. We acquired a small company that does personalized video billing. The acquisition increases the attractive of our core business. It provides a very important capability to businesses that are creating bills. The short-term results have been very encouraging. We have built a strong pipeline around the world, and this is a great example of buying a capability that's accretive to our core business.
Our software business had mixed results in the quarter. We did have a difficult compare as we landed a few large transactions last year in the second quarter. In the second quarter of this year, we did not have the benefit of particularly large deals and our software business in Europe performed below our expectations. I expect these dynamics to improve in the fourth quarter.
Finally, one last comment on our marketing services business. At one level, it would have been easier to retain these business. It was a good business fit. We made substantial improvements to our business in the last 2 years and was clearly helping our top and bottom line. That said, as stewards of our shareholders' capital, selling this business was the right thing to do.
Today, we're also updating our guidance to balance the stronger outlook for the second half with results to the first half of the year. A key reason for our first half outcome was the deleterious impact currency had on our ecommerce business. We expect these disruptions to be temporary, and we are very encouraged by the deals we have signed since April and the pipeline for the second half of the year. 
Bottom line, we expect the currency issues to stabilize and this business to be back on the growth path going forward. Therefore, we're adjusting our full year revenue guidance to minus 1 to plus 1. Michael will provide greater detail on our second half outlook in his remarks. The important point is we will always choose the creation of long-term shareholder value over the more expedient path.
So let me summarize. While I would characterize the second quarter and to an extent the first half results as mixed. We do believe the second half of the year will be on a much different track, and most importantly, we will continue to take the actions that drive long-term value to our shareholders. We have not and will not take the expedient path to optimize our quarter or even a year. It would certainly be easier to avoid making unnecessary investments in our systems, investments in our brand, forego disruptions in go-to-market to protect to protect the quarter or to retain a business that was contributing to our quarter results. 
That is not what this management team the story or this company is all about.
As we get to the back half of this transformation, the value and the benefits of our work is clearly in sight, and my conviction and resolve about our path going forward is stronger than ever.
I will now turn the podium to Mike."

As we've said when we originally provided guidance, 2015 is a transition year in the company's major transformation to unlock additional value for shareholders and clients. As Marc noted, we are now at an inflection poin",2968,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As we've said when we originally provided guidance, 2015 is a transition year in the company's major transformation to unlock additional value for shareholders and clients. As Marc noted, we are now at an inflection point in the business.
During the quarter, we completed 2 significant transactions, closed a number of open items, continued to streamline operations, and we saw our North American mailing revenue further stabilize as a result of our go-to-market changes. Accordingly, I'll spend a little more time this quarter delayering our results to clarify our operational progress and how we are positioned for an improving outlook beginning in the second half of the year.
During the first half of this year, we remain focused on 3 key objectives: to stabilize mail, grow Digital Commerce and improve operational excellence. In North American mailing, we experienced a slowing rate of decline in revenue, which was the lowest rate of decline in the last 5 quarters. Because of this trend and as the sales force becomes more productive, we have higher confidence of continued improvement in revenue trends for this segment going forward. Globally, the go-to-market transition is complete in most of our major markets. We are now implementing our transition in France. We expect these markets to improve in line with our North American experience. 
Additionally, we've completed several changes in our geographic footprint to exit low-margin countries, the impacts of which will annualize in the second half of this year. We will continue to evaluate the best markets to maintain a direct business presence. As result of these and several other actions we have taken, we have significantly reduced our cost structure throughout the business, which has improved the company's overall margins while at the same time helping us to operate more efficiently. We have yet to recognize the full benefits of some of these initiatives.
While we are seeing SG&A benefits of go-to-market changes across the portfolio, we intend to leverage these new selling capabilities with the new value propositions. Over the past several weeks and months, we have brought to market several new products and services across our businesses that allow us to bring our technologies and platforms to different segments of our client base. As Marc mentioned, we recently launched a SaaS-based SMB relay communications hub, which leverages our Production Mail document security capabilities and also introduced our personal interactive video solutions for high-volume mailers. We'll discuss these and other product plans further at our Analyst Day on September 16.
We've also taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio, focusing on high-growth opportunities in the global digital commerce markets. We exited our marketing services business, to which we got good value, and reinvested the proceeds in Borderfree, which significantly enhances our capabilities and positioning in cross-border ecommerce. 
In addition to our operational progress, we resolved a couple of open items. We sold our former World Headquarters building, freeing up approximately $40 million of capital and reached the settlement and principal to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the Department of Justice.
We have also made substantial progress on our ERP program and are preparing for an initial pilot. We accomplished a lot in the second quarter. Our path forward is clear on how we will improve our operational performance. Additionally, we have a stable capital structure that gives us flexibility in our capital allocation decisions.
So with that, let me break down our second quarter results for you. Once again, currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year had a meaningful impact on the comparison of our reported results for the quarter. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $36 million or 4%, and our earnings per share by nearly $0.02. Year-to-date, currency reduced revenue by $71 million and earnings per share by $0.03. These impacts are a result of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last year. Beyond the translation effects, currency also continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our ecommerce business. 
Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions in Europe from last year adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by more than $12 million or about 1%. Adjusting for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year, revenue would have declined about 3%. These headwinds will annualize in the second half of the year.
Let me now take you through the details of our income statement and then I'll review our business segment results. As a reminder, the company's second quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website. Also note, we revised our segment reporting to reflect how we are now operating the company. 
The Digital Commerce Solutions segment group is now comprised of our software solutions and global ecommerce segments. The global ecommerce segment results include our cross-border and shipping businesses. A new segment called other, includes the results of our recently divested marketing services business. All other segments remain unchanged. This will enhance investors ability to follow the performance of our key Digital Commerce growth initiatives going forward. The reclassified segment reporting on a historical basis can also be found on our Investor Relations website.
Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter totaled $881 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant-currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. Total revenue declined 3% compared to the prior year when adjusted for currency in the businesses we divested in Europe last year. On a constant-currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 4% in SMB solutions and 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 4% in Digital Commerce Solution, driven by growth in global ecommerce. Revenue declined 26% in the other segment as a result of the sale of marketing services during the quarter. Reported revenue, including the significant impact of currency during the quarter, declined 11% in SMB solutions, 5% in Enterprise Business Solutions and was flat in the Digital Commerce Solutions and declined 26% in other. 
SG&A this quarter includes a onetime stock-based compensation charge of $10 million directly associated with the Borderfree acquisition. SG&A also includes 1 month's worth of amortization of Borderfree-related intangibles of about $1 million. Adjusting for these items, SG&A declined $34 million from the prior year, and as a percent of revenue, improved by about 80 basis points. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest was $39 million, which was a decline of more than $3 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $180 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved to 20.4% or a 70-basis-point improvement over prior year despite the inclusion of currency impacts, loss of 1 month of Imagitas income and amortization of Borderfree-related intangibles.
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $223 million. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.5% compared to 33.4% in the prior year. The lower tax rate this quarter is mostly due to the mix of earnings.
Turning to earnings per share. Despite the lower revenue, we were still able to deliver adjusted EBIT margin improvement and earnings per share in line with our expectations. GAAP earnings per share was $0.75 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.45. Included in adjusted EPS is $0.02 per share of negative impact from currency. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.44 per share of other income due to the net gain from the sale of Imagitas, $0.05 per share of other expense for transaction costs and fees related to the Borderfree and Imagitas transactions and the settlement in principal to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the Department of Justice, $0.04 per share of compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the Borderfree acquisition, and $0.04 per share of restructuring and asset impairment charges, including the sale of our former World Headquarters building. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slide.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $84 million and $96 million on a GAAP-basis. In comparison to the prior year, second quarter free cash flow was lower primarily due to timing of working capital requirements, lower reserve account deposits and less of a decline in finance receivables. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $800 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $319 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.27%, which was flat to the prior year.
During the quarter, we returned $47 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, made $9 million in restructuring payments and received approximately $40 million of cash related to the sale of our former World Headquarters building. 
Also, we have $100 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As share repurchases have become a higher priority in our capital allocation strategy, we expect to begin utilizing this authorization in the third quarter and intend to complete the share repurchases that are currently authorized by the end of the year. Also at the end of the quarter, we continue to have $100 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Turning to our business segment results. In North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $357 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined 3% on a constant-currency basis and 4% on a reported basis while EBIT increased 2%. The decline in revenue was the lowest rate of decline in 5 quarters, reflecting a continuation of the stabilization and results. Equipment sales declined at a low single digit rate as the disruption from the change in go-to-market subsides and as the sales organization becomes more productive. 
Recurring revenue streams trends were in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 44.7% and improved 250 basis points versus the prior year due to continued benefits from the mix of business, organizational streamlining and other ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $111 million and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 15% on a constant-currency basis and 28% on a reported basis. Revenue declined 8%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. During the quarter, results continue to be impacted by the implementation of the go-to-market initiative, with most of our major markets now complete. France is out of consultation and is now implementing its go-to-market transition.
Revenue comparison was also adversely impacted by the timing of postal rate changes in a number of countries. EBIT margin was 12.8%, which was a decline of 450 basis points versus the prior year due primarily to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some supply chain costs and the timing of postal rate changes.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $98 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant-currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 6%, excluding currency and the divested revenues in Europe related to this segment. The decline this quarter was due to lower support services revenue and fewer equipment sales in Europe and Asia. U.S. equipment sales grew as a result of an increase in the number of inserting equipment installations. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was an improvement of 90 basis points versus the prior year due to favorable geographic mix and higher margin equipment sales as well as ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $114 million and EBIT was $24 million. Revenue grew 2% on both a constant-currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of first-class mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 20.7%, which was an improvement of 60 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $99 million and EBIT was $16 million. Revenue declined 4% on a constant-currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. Revenue was impacted by lower licensing and services sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which offset growth in licensing revenue in the Americas. However, as a result of go-to-market initiatives as well as new product introductions, the business is signing on a larger number of quality midsized deals, which will reduce dependency on onetime large deals and drive new client acquisitions. 
We are seeing this consistency and efficiencies in the business model playing out in substantially improved profitability in the software business. This, along with focused cost-reduction initiatives to streamline the operation, resulted in an EBIT margin of 16.3%, which was an improvement of 720 basis points versus the prior year.
For the global ecommerce segment, revenue was $78 million and EBIT was $3 million. Revenue grew 15% on a constant-currency basis and 14% on a reported basis. Revenue includes the Borderfree acquisition late in the quarter and expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service. However, outbound package shipments from the U.S. continued to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. Shipping solutions revenue continued to strengthen as a result of additional new clients. The shipping business is also benefiting directly from sales improvements in the SMB channel that markets its solutions to small and mid-sized companies. EBIT margin was 3.9%, which was a decline of 160 basis points from the prior year as a result of ongoing operational costs and integration investments related to the Borderfree acquisition as well as continued investment in the company's cross-border platforms.
Within the other segment. Revenue was $25 million and EBIT was $6 million. Revenue declined 26% on a constant currency and reported basis. As a result of the sale of the marketing services business in May, we recognized only 2 months of reported revenue this quarter versus the full quarter of revenue in the prior year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our accomplishment from the second quarter are expected to help drive improved results in the second half of the year. We expect the consolidated revenue growth on a constant-currency basis will improve in the third quarter from the current trend, with more significant growth in the fourth quarter, both driven by further stabilization of our mail-related businesses, benefits of new products and services and increased growth in our global ecommerce solutions. The fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from growth in software solutions, and the annualization of the impacts of the European market exits in 2014. Based on year-to-date results and our expectations of constant-currency growth of 1% to 5% in the second half of the year, we are adjusting our annual revenue guidance to a decline of 1% to growth of 1% when compared to 2014 on a constant-currency basis.
We are increasing annual GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21. This guidance includes the following: $0.44 per share of other income related to the net gain from the sale of Imagitas, $0.05 per share of other expense for the settlement in principle of an outstanding matter with the Department of Justice, and transaction costs and fees related to the Borderfree and Imagitas transactions, and $0.04 per share of restructuring and asset impairment charges, $0.04 per share of compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the Borderfree acquisition, $0.06 per share reduced earnings as a result of the sale of Imagitas, and $0.04 per share of reduced earnings related to Borderfree, which principally includes amortization of intangibles and integration investments, net of early savings from expected synergies.
We are also updating annual adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance solely to reflect the impacts of the Borderfree acquisition and Imagitas sale. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90. Included in adjusted earnings per share is the assumption that currency will have a $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year.
Free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million. This adjustment of $25 million simply reflects the impacts of the Borderfree acquisition and the Imagitas sale. Bottom line, our adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged except for the direct impact of the 2 transactions. While we have included a modest level of synergies this year related to the Borderfree integration as well as the investments to realize benefits, we are focused in the near term on driving a successful holiday season. 
That said, we see leverage across these highly complementary ecommerce businesses. And we are targeting a run rate synergy benefit of $25 million to $30 million in 18 months through the elimination of public company costs, logistics leverage and the consolidation of infrastructure. We'll provide greater details regarding our ecommerce growth strategy and related growth prospects at our Analyst Day in September.
Again, as Marc and I both noted, we view this quarter as an inflection point. We've taken a number of actions and made decisions that we believe will keep us on track to increase the long-term value of our company. We're confident that our performance, our products and our portfolio action will deliver on the strategic initiatives we laid out more than 2 years ago.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions."

The second is related to the Borderfree acquisition of $0.04 adjustment. That really reflects principally the amortization of the intangibles that are related to the acquisition. The amortization for this -- basically for the 7 months of the year that we would own the business, there's net about an additional $0.01 related to investments associated with integration of the business, offset by some early synergies associated with the business. So the net change is $0.10 in the adjusted earnings EPS range, and that's specifically related to those 2 items."

The reason we're more -- the reason we are confident in the second half projections really breaks into 2 categories. First of all, from a macro economic perspective, as you look around the world, clearly, the expectations for higher GDP growth, that will inevitably help us. Secondly, we do think some of the effects of currency will either begin to wrap and or stabilize. So you're in presumably a better macroeconomic environment. The part that gives us the most confidence, however, is with -- is what's within our own grasp and then I'll point to a couple of topics. First of all, as you look at our channel maturation of 4 SMB in North America, as well as Europe,  ex-France, you're another quarter along. I expect North America to be more or less kind of back on the horse in the second half of the year. And Europe SMB, ex-France, again, to be more in line with our long-term expectations in the second half of the year. The pipeline indicates the kind of what we see in the business so far in the case. That's point 1. Point 2, as it relates to ecommerce, in particular. If you look at the clients that were signed in the second quarter, coupled with what's in the pipeline. You can touch and feel those revenue streams as they come online. So that gives us a high degree of confidence there. And finally, you mentioned the personal video. That will help. We've got the new product announcements that will help. So we got a lot of things that are in-flight -- currently in flight that are already out there that will begin to help in the third quarter and help substantially in the fourth quarter."

As it relates to North American SMB, if you look at the original guidance that we had talked about in terms of our long-term model, we had set a goalpost of between minus 1 and minus 4 in the second quarter ex-currency, we were at 3 -- minus 3. As Mike indicated, that decline was the best performance that we had in 5 quarters. Parenthetically, it's the second best performance that we've had since I've been here. That said, we do see continued improvement in that business in the second half of the year. Our objective has been and continues to be to operate on the right side of that football field between minus 1 and minus 4. We're not there yet but we're getting closer, and it's in our sights.

Importantly, we didn't predicate those synergies on revenue topside opportunities. That wasn't because we didn't see them, it was just because we wanted to base the synergies on what we could describe with a high degree of confidence. The revenue synergies will come from principally the following. If you think about a respective development and innovation road maps, there was a reasonable amount of overlap on what they were trying to innovate around and what we're trying to innovate around. As you go forward, if you're able to rationalize those respective development plans, so you'll be able to innovate even faster in the respective marketplace -- in the respective markets, the marketplaces and retailers. So I think that's principally where we see the opportunities. We say this is a very exciting space to be able to innovate for our clients and to solve a real-life problem.

So as I work at our portfolio today, I like how everything fits. And clearly, they're on their path of making acceptable returns. I will not preclude those dynamics changing. And it's certainly hard to predict the dynamics of how 1 enterprise sees value versus how you see it. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to look at our development plans for the next 5 years, and we look at make versus buy decisions. We've got a series of I would characterize as mostly smaller types of transactions that we look at. And if we can get those for the right price, we'll do it.

There was some bright spots, in North America SMB did better. Presort continued to do reasonably well. North America software business performed reasonably. That being said, on balance, we should have done better. And we are taking actions to improve our execution as we get into the second half of the year. 
The second point I think that's the more important point is that we really made substantial progress on our long-term strategy in the second quarter. The acquisition of Borderfree, I believe, will be game changing with a market leader, with first-mover advantage and a very substantial and fast-growing market. Also, worth noting, and we haven't talked a lot about this, but we have a world-class management team in that business right now. That gives me even more confidence. You'll see more about this, but it is something that gives us great optimism. 
In our SMB business, the new market, approach is settling down. We see clearly within our sights improvement both in the North American SMB business as well as International Mailing. Again, that adds up for the long-term, very, very well. 
Finally, we continue to drive operational excellence, and thereby, unlock substantial shareholder value and continue to become more efficient, simplifying our business and rationalizing our portfolio. Significantly, we continue to make real progress with our systems work, and as Mike indicated, the benefits are now clearly in our sights. 
I said in my prepared remarks that our focus is to create shareholder value, and we'll always choose the creation of shareholder value over the more expedient path of protecting a quarter or a year. [ Audio Gap] that strategies are necessarily long-term in nature. I've now been at this about 30 months. We described this as a 3- to 5-year transformation, and you can see as you get to the back half of that transformation, the benefits are clearly within our grasp. 
I, as I said at the outset, am very, very pleased with where we are in our overall transformation. And as I said, the benefits are now in our sights. I look forward to giving you a more detailed update at our Analyst Day in September. Until then, we'll see you. Thank you."

Thanks for joining us today. Earlier this year, I told you that 2015 was going to be a pivotal year in our transformation. I also told you that we would move forward with the same disciplined focus required",1633,"Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier this year, I told you that 2015 was going to be a pivotal year in our transformation. I also told you that we would move forward with the same disciplined focus required for the long-term success of the company. The objective of our transformation has been, and continues to be, to create long-term value. 
In the second quarter, we took several actions to transform Pitney Bowes and to create value. We closed on the sale of World Headquarters building and also closed on a sale of our marketing services business. Both of these transactions are clear evidence of our disciplined focus to unlock the value of our business and to be good stewards of our shareholders' capital.
In the case of our marketing services business, it was and is a great business. It fit with our overall portfolio but simply worth more to Red Ventures than it was to us. This is a clear demonstration of the kinds of action we will take in order to create value for our shareholders.
On the other side of the ledger, and I'll come back to this later in my comments, we acquired Borderfree. Borderfree is a perfect fit with our ecommerce business and is highly synergistic. Moreover, it positions Pitney Bowes as a clear leader in a fast-growing, multibillion-dollar market place. The actions which we took which build on the work we did during the previous 2 years have strengthened our hand and improved our competitive position in key markets and made us more focused and more efficient. As a result, we are now at an inflection point in our transformation. The cumulative effects of the steps we have taken over the past 3 months will begin to fuel sustained long-term growth and profitability.
In terms of the second quarter, Mike will give you specific details, but I will characterize the results as mixed. Our Presort business continued to perform very well. Our North American SMB business continued to improve, and our North American Software business executed well. 
Conversely, our ecommerce business growth rates were negatively affected by the strong dollar, and I would say our overall performance in Europe was below what we had expected. And in general, the strong dollar continues to have a negative impact on our top and our bottom line. In the near term, the progress we made in the first half of the year sets us up for improved performance in the second half. As for the longer term, we will talk more about that at our Analyst Day in September.
Let me now comment on the progress of our long-term strategic initiatives. First, the stabilization of our Mail business. In the second quarter, the decline of our SMB business continued to moderate and is now approaching the levels of performance we're experiencing before we adjusted our go-to-market, albeit with a much more efficient and effective expense structure. We expect to see continued progress in our North American SMB business in the second half of the year. Likewise, the progress we have made in our North American SMB business reaffirms our conviction that we're on the right track with the changes we have made in Europe, although clearly, the changes have caused temporary disruptions.
Also of note, we made an important product announcement. On July 15, we announced  Relay Multi-Channel Communications Suite. Relay is a major step forward in providing small and medium businesses with an integrated solution that creates communications for both digital and physical channels. This product announcement is more than it may seem on first blush for a couple of reasons. 
First, this product announcement is an example of innovation in our legacy business. This announcement is the first of several we are planning. Second, and perhaps even more importantly, it is a great example of taking our digital capabilities and in driving them into our legacy business, and ultimately, our 1.5 million clients. Initial responses from our clients from around the world had been very positive, and we believe this product will provide a lift to our business in the second half of the year. More and more, our focus is how we make our individual businesses accretive to one another. Much more on this as we get to Analyst Day.
Second, our continued effort to drive operational excellence into our business. As I've always said, operational excellence is only important if you can find the evidence in your balance sheet, your income statement or your work with clients. We are seeing progress in all of these measures. Our SG&A as a percent of revenue, continued to improve in the second quarter, and our debt levels were $245 million lower than a year ago. The net of this is our gross and net margins continued to improve towards historically high levels. 
Also of note, we removed 2 layers of management in structure in our European SMB business. We believe these actions will reduce bureaucracy, improve our speed and accountability, and obviously, will reduce our overall expense structure.
Finally, we continue to make progress on our systems projects. We exited an important phase of our systems test and entered into the next phase of testing with a focus on implementing in Canada later this year. This project will provide substantial benefits to our business, unlock value and provide the right platform to better serve our clients. The net impact of all of these changes is that we are dramatically simplifying our business and building an effective and efficient platform for growth.
Finally, growing our business through Digital Commerce. The big highlight from the second quarter for this strategic initiative was the acquisition of Borderfree. Mike will give you the specifics, but this is one of the most exciting acquisitions I have been involved with. 
Borderfree had developed great capabilities for e-tailers, and coupled with our best-of-class capabilities for e-marketplaces, the 2 businesses are highly synergistic. In addition to providing more complete capabilities to the market, there are substantial synergies with the respective costs and expense structures. 
Going forward, we have best-of-class capabilities, first-mover advantage in a multibillion-dollar marketplace growing at double-digit plus rates. Again, we will talk more about this business at Analyst Day.
And once again, our shipping software business had a good quarter, growing at double-digit rates. We're using our SMB channel to sell the software product. This is another example of how we use our capabilities in one business to make another business better, one business being accretive to another business and using our global distribution to take our product quickly around the world. 
Also in the second quarter, we consummated a smaller transaction that probably flew under the radar screen. This acquisition was within our communications engagement software business. We acquired a small company that does personalized video billing. The acquisition increases the attractiveness of our core business. It provides a very important capability to businesses that are creating bills. The short-term results have been very encouraging. We have built a strong pipeline around the world, and this is a great example of buying a capability that's accretive to our core business.
Our software business had mixed results in the quarter. We did have a difficult compare as we landed a few large transactions last year in the second quarter. In the second quarter of this year, we did not have the benefit of particularly large deals and our software business in Europe performed below our expectations. I expect these dynamics to improve in the fourth quarter.
Finally, one last comment on our marketing services business. At one level, it would have been easier to retain these business. It was a good business fit. We made substantial improvements to our business in the last 2 years and was clearly helping our top and bottom line. That said, as stewards of our shareholders' capital, selling this business was the right thing to do.
Today, we're also updating our guidance to balance the stronger outlook for the second half with results through the first half of the year. A key reason for our first half outcome was the deleterious impact currency had on our ecommerce business. We expect these disruptions to be temporary, and we are very encouraged by the deals we have signed since April and the pipeline for the second half of the year. 
Bottom line, we expect the currency issues to stabilize and this business to be back on the growth path going forward. Therefore, we're adjusting our full year revenue guidance to minus 1 to plus 1. Michael will provide greater detail on our second half outlook in his remarks. The important point is we will always choose the creation of long-term shareholder value over the more expedient path.
So let me summarize. While I would characterize the second quarter and to an extent the first half results as mixed. We do believe the second half of the year will be on a much different track, and most importantly, we will continue to take the actions that drive long-term value to our shareholders. We have not and will not take the expedient path to optimize our quarter or even a year. It would certainly be easier to avoid making necessary investments in our systems, investments in our brand, forego disruptions in go-to-market to protect the quarter or to retain a business that was contributing to our quarter results. 
That is not what this management team, the story or this company is all about.
As we get to the back half of this transformation, the value and the benefits of our work is clearly in sight, and my conviction and resolve about our path going forward is stronger than ever.
I will now turn the podium to Mike."

As we've said when we originally provided guidance, 2015 is a transition year in the company's major transformation to unlock additional value for shareholders and clients. As Marc noted, we are now at an inflection poin",2968,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As we've said when we originally provided guidance, 2015 is a transition year in the company's major transformation to unlock additional value for shareholders and clients. As Marc noted, we are now at an inflection point in the business.
During the quarter, we completed 2 significant transactions, closed a number of open items, continued to streamline operations, and we saw our North American mailing revenue further stabilize as a result of our go-to-market changes. Accordingly, I'll spend a little more time this quarter delayering our results to clarify our operational progress and how we are positioned for an improving outlook beginning in the second half of the year.
During the first half of this year, we remain focused on 3 key objectives: to stabilize mail, grow Digital Commerce and improve operational excellence. In North American mailing, we experienced a slowing rate of decline in revenue, which was the lowest rate of decline in the last 5 quarters. Because of this trend and as the sales force becomes more productive, we have higher confidence of continued improvement in revenue trends for this segment going forward. Globally, the go-to-market transition is complete in most of our major markets. We are now implementing our transition in France. We expect these markets to improve in line with our North American experience. 
Additionally, we've completed several changes in our geographic footprint to exit low-margin countries, the impacts of which will annualize in the second half of this year. We will continue to evaluate the best markets to maintain a direct business presence. As result of these and several other actions we have taken, we have significantly reduced our cost structure throughout the business, which has improved the company's overall margins while at the same time helping us to operate more efficiently. We have yet to recognize the full benefits of some of these initiatives.
While we are seeing SG&A benefits of go-to-market changes across the portfolio, we intend to leverage these new selling capabilities with the new value propositions. Over the past several weeks and months, we have brought to market several new products and services across our businesses that allow us to bring our technologies and platforms to different segments of our client base. As Marc mentioned, we recently launched a SaaS-based SMB relay communications hub, which leverages our Production Mail document security capabilities and also introduced our personal interactive video solutions for high-volume mailers. We'll discuss these and other product plans further at our Analyst Day on September 16.
We've also taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio, focusing on high-growth opportunities in the global digital commerce markets. We exited our marketing services business, to which we got good value, and reinvested the proceeds in Borderfree, which significantly enhances our capabilities and positioning in cross-border ecommerce. 
In addition to our operational progress, we resolved a couple of open items. We sold our former World Headquarters building, freeing up approximately $40 million of capital and reached the settlement in principle to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the Department of Justice.
We have also made substantial progress on our ERP program and are preparing for an initial pilot. We accomplished a lot in the second quarter. Our path forward is clear on how we will improve our operational performance. Additionally, we have a stable capital structure that gives us flexibility in our capital allocation decisions.
So with that, let me break down our second quarter results for you. Once again, currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year had a meaningful impact on the comparison of our reported results for the quarter. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $36 million or 4%, and our earnings per share by nearly $0.02. Year-to-date, currency reduced revenue by $71 million and earnings per share by $0.03. These impacts are a result of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last year. Beyond the translation effects, currency also continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our ecommerce business. 
Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions in Europe from last year adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by more than $12 million or about 1%. Adjusting for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year, revenue would have declined about 3%. These headwinds will annualize in the second half of the year.
Let me now take you through the details of our income statement and then I'll review our business segment results. As a reminder, the company's second quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website. Also note, we revised our segment reporting to reflect how we are now operating the company. 
The Digital Commerce Solutions segment group is now comprised of our software solutions and global ecommerce segments. The global ecommerce segment results include our cross-border and shipping businesses. A new segment called other, includes the results of our recently divested marketing services business. All other segments remain unchanged. This will enhance investors ability to follow the performance of our key Digital Commerce growth initiatives going forward. The reclassified segment reporting on a historical basis can also be found on our Investor Relations website.
Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter totaled $881 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant-currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. Total revenue declined 3% compared to the prior year when adjusted for currency and the businesses we divested in Europe last year. On a constant-currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 4% in SMB solutions and 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 4% in Digital Commerce Solution, driven by growth in global ecommerce. Revenue declined 26% in the other segment as a result of the sale of marketing services during the quarter. Reported revenue, including the significant impact of currency during the quarter, declined 11% in SMB solutions, 5% in Enterprise Business Solutions and was flat in the Digital Commerce Solutions and declined 26% in other. 
SG&A this quarter includes a onetime stock-based compensation charge of $10 million directly associated with the Borderfree acquisition. SG&A also includes 1 month's worth of amortization of Borderfree-related intangibles of about $1 million. Adjusting for these items, SG&A declined $34 million from the prior year, and as a percent of revenue, improved by about 80 basis points. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest was $39 million, which was a decline of more than $3 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $180 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved to 20.4% or a 70-basis-point improvement over prior year despite the inclusion of currency impacts, loss of 1 month of Imagitas income and amortization of Borderfree-related intangibles.
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $223 million. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.5% compared to 33.4% in the prior year. The lower tax rate this quarter is mostly due to the mix of earnings.
Turning to earnings per share. Despite the lower revenue, we were still able to deliver adjusted EBIT margin improvement and earnings per share in line with our expectations. GAAP earnings per share were $0.75 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.45. Included in adjusted EPS is $0.02 per share of negative impact from currency. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.44 per share of other income due to the net gain from the sale of Imagitas, $0.05 per share of other expense for transaction costs and fees related to the Borderfree and Imagitas transactions and the settlement in principle to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the Department of Justice, $0.04 per share of compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the Borderfree acquisition, and $0.04 per share of restructuring and asset impairment charges, including the sale of our former World Headquarters building. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slide.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $84 million and $96 million on a GAAP-basis. In comparison to the prior year, second quarter free cash flow was lower primarily due to timing of working capital requirements, lower reserve account deposits and less of a decline in finance receivables. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $800 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $319 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.27%, which was flat to the prior year.
During the quarter, we returned $47 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, made $9 million in restructuring payments and received approximately $40 million of cash related to the sale of our former World Headquarters building. 
Also, we have $100 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As share repurchases have become a higher priority in our capital allocation strategy, we expect to begin utilizing this authorization in the third quarter and intend to complete the share repurchases that are currently authorized by the end of the year. Also at the end of the quarter, we continue to have $100 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Turning to our business segment results. In North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $357 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined 3% on a constant-currency basis and 4% on a reported basis while EBIT increased 2%. The decline in revenue was the lowest rate of decline in 5 quarters, reflecting a continuation of the stabilization in results. Equipment sales declined at a low single digit rate as the disruption from the change in go-to-market subsides and as the sales organization becomes more productive. 
Recurring revenue streams trends were in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 44.7% and improved 250 basis points versus the prior year due to continued benefits from the mix of business, organizational streamlining and other ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $111 million and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 15% on a constant-currency basis and 28% on a reported basis. Revenue declined 8%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. During the quarter, results continue to be impacted by the implementation of the go-to-market initiative, with most of our major markets now complete. France is out of consultation and is now implementing its go-to-market transition.
Revenue comparison was also adversely impacted by the timing of postal rate changes in a number of countries. EBIT margin was 12.8%, which was a decline of 450 basis points versus the prior year due primarily to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some supply chain costs and the timing of postal rate changes.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $98 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant-currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 6%, excluding currency and the divested revenues in Europe related to this segment. The decline this quarter was due to lower support services revenue and fewer equipment sales in Europe and Asia. U.S. equipment sales grew as a result of an increase in the number of inserting equipment installations. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was an improvement of 90 basis points versus the prior year due to favorable geographic mix and higher margin equipment sales as well as ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $114 million and EBIT was $24 million. Revenue grew 2% on both a constant-currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of first-class mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 20.7%, which was an improvement of 60 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $99 million and EBIT was $16 million. Revenue declined 4% on a constant-currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. Revenue was impacted by lower licensing and services sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which offset growth in licensing revenue in the Americas. However, as a result of go-to-market initiatives as well as new product introductions, the business is signing on a larger number of quality midsized deals, which will reduce dependency on onetime large deals and drive new client acquisitions. 
We are seeing this consistency and efficiencies in the business model playing out in substantially improved profitability in the software business. This, along with focused cost-reduction initiatives to streamline the operation, resulted in an EBIT margin of 16.3%, which was an improvement of 720 basis points versus the prior year.
For the global ecommerce segment, revenue was $78 million and EBIT was $3 million. Revenue grew 15% on a constant-currency basis and 14% on a reported basis. Revenue includes the Borderfree acquisition late in the quarter and expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service. However, outbound package shipments from the U.S. continued to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. Shipping solutions revenue continued to strengthen as a result of additional new clients. The shipping business is also benefiting directly from sales improvements in the SMB channel that markets its solutions to small and mid-sized companies. EBIT margin was 3.9%, which was a decline of 160 basis points from the prior year as a result of ongoing operational costs and integration investments related to the Borderfree acquisition as well as continued investment in the company's cross-border platforms.
Within the other segment. Revenue was $25 million and EBIT was $6 million. Revenue declined 26% on a constant currency and reported basis. As a result of the sale of the marketing services business in May, we recognized only 2 months of reported revenue this quarter versus the full quarter of revenue in the prior year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our accomplishment from the second quarter are expected to help drive improved results in the second half of the year. We expect the consolidated revenue growth on a constant-currency basis will improve in the third quarter from the current trend, with more significant growth in the fourth quarter, both driven by further stabilization of our mail-related businesses, benefits of new products and services and increased growth in our global ecommerce solutions. The fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from growth in software solutions, and the annualization of the impacts of the European market exits in 2014. Based on year-to-date results and our expectations of constant-currency growth of 1% to 5% in the second half of the year, we are adjusting our annual revenue guidance to a decline of 1% to growth of 1% when compared to 2014 on a constant-currency basis.
We are increasing annual GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21. This guidance includes the following: $0.44 per share of other income related to the net gain from the sale of Imagitas, $0.05 per share of other expense for the settlement in principle of an outstanding matter with the Department of Justice, and transaction costs and fees related to the Borderfree and Imagitas transactions, and $0.04 per share of restructuring and asset impairment charges, $0.04 per share of compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the Borderfree acquisition, $0.06 per share reduced earnings as a result of the sale of Imagitas, and $0.04 per share of reduced earnings related to Borderfree, which principally includes amortization of intangibles and integration investments, net of early savings from expected synergies.
We are also updating annual adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance solely to reflect the impacts of the Borderfree acquisition and Imagitas sale. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90. Included in adjusted earnings per share is the assumption that currency will have a $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year.
Free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million. This adjustment of $25 million simply reflects the impacts of the Borderfree acquisition and the Imagitas sale. Bottom line, our adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged except for the direct impacts of the 2 transactions. While we have included a modest level of synergies this year related to the Borderfree integration as well as the investments to realize benefits, we are focused in the near term on driving a successful holiday season. 
That said, we see leverage across these highly complementary ecommerce businesses. And we are targeting a run rate synergy benefit of $25 million to $30 million in 18 months through the elimination of public company costs, logistics leverage and the consolidation of infrastructure. We'll provide greater details regarding our ecommerce growth strategy and related growth prospects at our Analyst Day in September.
Again, as Marc and I both noted, we view this quarter as an inflection point. We've taken a number of actions and made decisions that we believe will keep us on track to increase the long-term value of our company. We're confident that our performance, our products and our portfolio actions will deliver on the strategic initiatives we laid out more than 2 years ago.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions."

The amortization for this -- basically for the 7 months of the year that we would own the business, there's net about an additional $0.01 related to investments associated with integration of the business, offset by some early synergies associated with the business. So the net change is $0.10 in the adjusted earnings EPS range, and that's specifically related to those 2 items."

The reason we're more -- the reason we are confident in the second half projections really breaks into 2 categories. First of all, from a macro economic perspective, as you look around the world, clearly, the expectations for higher GDP growth, that will inevitably help us. Secondly, we do think some of the effects of currency will either begin to wrap and or stabilize. So you're in presumably a better macroeconomic environment. The part that gives us the most confidence, however, is with -- is what's within our own grasp and then I'll point to a couple of topics. First of all, as you look at our channel maturation of 4 SMB in North America, as well as Europe,  ex-France, you're another quarter along. I expect North America to be more or less kind of back on the horse in the second half of the year. And Europe SMB, ex-France, again, to be more in line with our long-term expectations in the second half of the year. The pipeline indicates that, kind of what we see in the business so far indicates that. That's point 1. Point 2, as it relates to ecommerce, in particular. If you look at the clients that were signed in the second quarter, coupled with what's in the pipeline. You can touch and feel those revenue streams as they come online. So that gives us a high degree of confidence there. And finally, you mentioned the personal video. That will help. We've got the new product announcements that will help. So we got a lot of things that are in-flight -- currently in flight that are already out there that will begin to help in the third quarter and help substantially in the fourth quarter."

As it relates to North American SMB, if you look at the original guidance that we had talked about in terms of our long-term model, we had set a goalpost of between minus 1 and minus 4 in the second quarter ex-currency, we were at 3 -- minus 3. As Mike indicated, that decline was the best performance that we had in 5 quarters. Parenthetically, it's the second best performance that we've had since I've been here. That said, we do see continued improvement in that business in the second half of the year. Our objective has been and continues to be to operate on the right side of that football field between minus 1 and minus 4. We're not there yet but we're getting closer, and it's in our sights.

Importantly, we didn't predicate those synergies on revenue topside opportunities. That wasn't because we didn't see them, it was just because we wanted to base the synergies on what we could describe with a high degree of confidence. The revenue synergies will come from principally the following. If you think about a respective development and innovation road maps, there was a reasonable amount of overlap on what they were trying to innovate around and what we're trying to innovate around. As you go forward, if you're able to rationalize those respective development plans, so you'll be able to innovate even faster in the respective marketplace -- in the respective markets, the marketplaces and e-tailers. So I think that's principally where we see the opportunities. We say this is a very exciting space to be able to innovate for our clients and to solve a real-life problem.

So as I look at our portfolio today, I like how everything fits. And clearly, they're on their path of making acceptable returns. I will not preclude those dynamics changing.

There was some bright spots, in North America SMB did better. Presort continued to do reasonably well. North America software business performed reasonably. That being said, on balance, we should have done better. And we are taking actions to improve our execution as we get into the second half of the year. 
The second point I think that's the more important point is that we really made substantial progress on our long-term strategy in the second quarter. The acquisition of Borderfree, I believe, will be game changing. We're the market leader, with first-mover advantage in a very substantial and fast-growing market. Also, worth noting, and we haven't talked a lot about this, but we have a world-class management team in that business right now. That gives me even more confidence. You'll see more about this, but it is something that gives us great optimism. 
In our SMB business, the new market, approach is settling down. We see clearly within our sights improvement both in the North American SMB business as well as International Mailing. Again, setting us up for the long-term, very, very well. 
Finally, we continue to drive operational excellence, and thereby, unlock substantial shareholder value and continue to become more efficient, simplifying our business and rationalizing our portfolio. Significantly, we continue to make real progress with our systems work, and as Mike indicated, the benefits are now clearly in our sights. 
I said in my prepared remarks that our focus is to create shareholder value, and we'll always choose the creation of shareholder value over the more expedient path of protecting a quarter or a year. [ Audio Gap] that strategies are necessarily long-term in nature. I've now been at this about 30 months. We described this as a 3- to 5-year transformation, and you can see as you get to the back half of that transformation, the benefits are clearly within our grasp. 
I, as I said at the outset, am very, very pleased with where we are in our overall transformation. And as I said, the benefits are now in our sights. I look forward to giving you a more detailed update at our Analyst Day in September. Until then, we'll see you. Thank you."

Over the last",649,"Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. At our Analyst Day meeting in September, we reaffirmed our strategy we rolled out in 2013. We did this for a very simple reason: The strategy is working. Over the last 30 months, our strategy, and importantly, our execution has increased the market value of Pitney Bowes by nearly $2 billion, while dramatically improving our balance sheet. We remain focused on the same basic 3 pillars of our strategy. It is in that context that I will make my remarks about what we've accomplished in the last 90 days.
In terms of the stabilization of mail, and what we to be the reinvention of mail. We continue to make progress on the third quarter. In North America, which as you know, is the engine of our cash production, the rate of revenue decline continued to moderate to less than 2% on a constant currency basis. This is within the long-term range of that we've pointed to. And more importantly, equipment sales, which are the harbinger of future revenue performance, increased in the third quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend but this was an important turning point for us.
Likewise, our International Mailing business continued to recover from the disruption from the go-to-market change as we foreshadowed in our second quarter recap and reiterated at Analyst Day. We expect this trend to continue. Our enterprise business, presort and Production Mail, operated within the long-term band that we laid out in 2013, and reiterated a couple of weeks ago. Worth noting our Presort business continued to perform well and is delivering a very high level of client satisfaction. Finally, consistent with our notion of reinventing our mail business, we have several important product announcements leveraging our digital technologies into our installed base. We've just scratched the surface of this important opportunity.
In terms of operational excellence, we continue to hit the ball. Gross and EBIT margins both increased and cash flow was solid. We will never be done with our operational excellence initiatives but we are making progress here more to do with solid progress.
Also in early October, we went live with our systems project in Canada. As Mike described at Analyst Day, this is much more than an ERP project. This is a total retool of our business processes, along with the accompanying technology to automate these processes. Results are early, and we have still a lot of work to do, but the results in Canada have been very encouraging. We are already seeing productivity improvements after a couple of weeks and the problems have been less than what I have seen in other similar projects. And I've seen a lot of them. I will reiterate that we are early in our deployment but so far so good. As we said before this project is key to delivering a superior client experience and unlocking substantial shareholder value.
In terms of growth in our Digital Commerce businesses, we grew double digits at constant currency in our integration of Borderfree and realization of the planned synergies are on track. We're also working with new clients of that hold promise of real opportunity in the future. That said, our cross-border business continue to face headwinds, which had a negative effect on our revenue results. Our Software business executed well but that we have a tough compare. In our shipping business we did not execute as well as we would have liked. On balance, however, across the segment our performance was reasonable, although we're definitely working to overcome some external issues around currencies. In conclusion, as always there are some positives and negatives about the quarter. And I consider our quarterly execution an important indicator. That being said, however, our progress against our strategic work list remains on track. I will now turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter.

As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. International Mailing's revenue trend improved from prior quarters and as a result, total SMB revenue on a constant currency basis declined at its lowest rate in 6 quarters, a further indication of the stabilization of our mailing businesses. Presort Services and Global Ecommerce both continued to deliver revenue growth. And each of our business segment groups, SMB, enterprise and Digital Commerce, had revenue performance that was within the long-term market growth rate ranges that I outlined at our Analyst Day.
Also as we discussed at the Analyst Day in our last earnings call, we have launched several new products and services across our businesses that bring our technologies and solutions to broader parts of our client base. Additionally, we've been working to expand our Presort operations recently adding 2 new sites to our network. During the quarter, we also continued to make significant progress against our long-term strategic objectives. To cite a few examples, our ERP project team has worked countless hours to deliver a successful go live launch of our new ERP platform in Canada early in October. Likewise, our Global Ecommerce management team has been working diligently to integrate the Pitney Bowes and Borderfree businesses, while identifying and achieving cost synergies. In our Mailing business in France, we transitioned to a new sales model. And in our Software business, we continue to offer new targeted solutions for enterprise clients, including our newly EngageOne Video software solution. Now let me take you through our results for the quarter and then I'll provide a little more detail around our outlook for the balance of the year. As with the first half of the year, currency again had a meaningful impact on the comparisons of our reported results for the quarter. Additionally as a reminder, revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the sale of and the acquisition of Borderfree last quarter, while both of these businesses had similar revenue profiles on an annual basis, seasonally, has had its best revenue performance in the third quarter and Borderfree has its best revenue performance in the fourth quarter. During the quarter currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or 4% and our earnings per share by $0.02. Year-to-date currency has reduced revenue by $105 million or 4%, and earnings per share by $0.05. Beyond these translation effects, the strong U.S. dollar has continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our ecommerce business. Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions we took in Europe last year unfavorably impacted our revenue comparisons by approximately $4 million this quarter. While this did not have a meaningful impact on our total revenue comparison, it did impact more meaningfully the individual segments, which I will discuss shortly. This is the last quarter to be affected by these year-over-year comparisons. Before I review the results of the quarter in more detail, I want to remind you that the company's third quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Now turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $870 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 3% in SMB solutions and was flat in enterprise business solutions. Revenue grew 10% in Digital Commerce Solutions. As I mentioned at the outset of my discussion, these growth rates are all in line with the long-term market growth rates I presented at Analyst Day and are an improvement from the second quarter. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% in SMB solutions and 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Reported revenue in Digital Commerce Solutions grew 6%. Gross margin this quarter was 58%, an improvement of 150 basis points from prior year, driven in part by growth in high-margin mail finishing equipment in North America SMB, production Mail and server sales globally and the addition of Borderfree revenue in our ecommerce business. SG&A this quarter totaled $309 million, which was a reduction of $33 million from the prior year despite the inclusion of about $4 million of amortization of intangibles expense for Borderfree and higher spend related to our Canada ERP go live preparation. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by 70 basis points, further evidence of the success of our continued focus on operational excellence. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $38 million, which was a decline of more than $4 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $173 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year despite the adverse impact of currency, the loss of high margin Imagitas income and the Borderfree and ERP items I just noted. Adding back total depreciation and amortization for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $215 million.
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.4% compared to 16% in the prior year. As a reminder, prior year tax rate included $16 million in tax benefits from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, the 2014 effective tax rate would have been 28.3%.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS were $0.43. Prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and included $0.08 per share of tax benefits that I just referenced. When you exclude those tax benefits, last year's adjusted EPS were also $0.43.
GAAP EPS were $0.44 and included a $0.01 per share net tax benefit primarily related to the previous divestiture of an investment and some additional acquisition and disposition-related transaction costs. Earnings per share this quarter were adversely impacted by a $0.02 per share reduction related to currency translation. As expected, earnings per share were also impacted by the loss of 3 months of Imagitas earnings, which were estimated to be approximately $0.03 per share and $0.01 per share of expense for the amortization of intangibles related to Borderfree. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slides.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $131 million and cash provided by operating activities was $150 million on a GAAP basis. When compared to the prior year, third quarter free cash flow was higher, primarily due to lower working capital requirement and lower capital expenditures from a reduced level of investment in ERP this quarter.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of total debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $750 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Included in total debt at the end of the quarter was $150 million in commercial paper outstanding. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $286 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.22%, which was a slight reduction of 60 basis points from the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $38 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, repurchased 4.9 million shares for $100 million and made $15 million in restructuring payments.
Also, during the quarter our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100 million of share repurchase.
Turning to our business segment results. For SMB Solutions in North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $353 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined just 1.6% on a constant currency basis and less than 3% on a reported basis, which was the lowest rate of decline in 6 quarters. Revenue benefited from 2% growth in equipment sales as productivity continues to improve. Recurring revenue stream trends also continued to be in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.1% an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business, organizational streamlining and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $105 million and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant currency basis and 21% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 7%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. The rate of decline in revenue is stabilizing in most of the major markets where the go-to-market greaser shift has been completed. We focused on transitioning the sales organization in France during the quarter, which is expected to improve productivity. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was a decline of 190 basis points from prior year due to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some cost and the temporary incremental cost of transitioning the sales organization in France.
Turning to the enterprise business solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $102 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 4% excluding currency and the divested revenue in Europe related to this segment. Inserting equipment sales grew versus prior year. However, there were no production print installations during the quarter, which adversely impacted revenue. Revenue also declined partly due to lower support services revenue this quarter. EBIT margin was 12.2%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to the mix of high-margin inserting equipment sales as well as ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $116 million, and EBIT was $26 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of First Class and Standard mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 22.4%, which was an improvement of 270 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $98 million and EBIT was $15 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier revenue comparisons were impacted by lower licensing revenue in the Americas when compared to the prior year, which included a large licensing deal. Excluding the impact of that deal, software results were positive and in line with expectations as the businesses acquiring new enterprise clients through targeted industry and application-specific solutions. EBIT margin was 15%, a decline of 190 basis points from prior year as a result of lower licensing revenue, which carries a higher margin.
For the global ecommerce segment, revenue was $97 million, and EBIT was a loss of $1 million. Revenue grew 36% on a constant currency basis and 34% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and the continued expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service.
Outbound package shipments from the U.S. continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. EBIT margin was a negative 1%, which was relatively flat to prior year despite incremental expenses, including the amortization of intangibles as well as expense and investments related to the Borderfree acquisition. These incremental expenses offset benefits from initial integration synergies during the quarter. The other segment is comprised of the Imagitas marketing services business, which was sold in May of this year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to focus the discussion on guidance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect the improving trends experienced in the third quarter to continue and further improve in the fourth quarter as a result of the actions we've taken to achieve our long-term strategic initiatives. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance. We are modifying our revenue guidance for the following reasons: First, the relatively strong U.S. dollar continues to impact cross-border ecommerce purchases through our U.S.-based ecommerce business. Second, we are still working through the SMB go-to-market transition in France. We substantially transitioned the sales organization by the end of the third quarter but there are still more to do to achieve the productivity levels we are targeting. And third the uncertain global economic environment is impacting some capital investment decisions, which is impacting our Production Mail and software businesses. Therefore, we now expect annual revenue to be in the range of flat to a decline of 2% when compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis. As I noted we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year as operational excellence initiatives are expected to drive further cost reductions and efficiencies in the business. Adjusted EPS is still expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90 and GAAP EPS is still expected to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21 for the year. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million for the year. That concludes my remarks.

But obviously, as you know, don't come with a lot of profit. And as we focus ourselves on driving revenue with profit, we have walked away from some of those opportunities that would make economic sense for us. So as we've always said going to be a lumpy business. It was not great from a top line perspective in the third quarter and pretty darn good from a profit perspective. We like our hen going forward."

The other thing benefiting supplies is in our Production Mail business, even though we didn't have any placements [indiscernible] in the quarter, as a built and installed base of printers out there, that drive supplies revenue as well. So that was a positive. And as we achieve future placements, that helps build an incremental recurring revenue stream. With respect to rentals, I would say you are seeing the stabilization certainly in the North American Mailing business. On the international side, that's been impacted somewhat by the go-to-market, particularly in France, which is the other key market where we see rental. So to Marc's earlier comments, as we see stabilization in those markets and particularly in France on a go-forward basis, that should help over time with rentals.

The next move for them is to kind of think where we started general [indiscernible] product specialists the next turn of the crank is to grow from product specialist to solution sales. So let me give an example of what that means. So we have our customer information management businesses. That's a line of business that's a product specialty, if you will.

The people that know about money-laundering and know your customer and other types of application areas that become important to the client. So I get predicate of your question looking at the third quarter results. I would say that they've hit the ball fairly consistent with what we think our long-term expectations are the last couple of years. And they had more opportunities for productivity.

In terms of our strategic road map, but I think this is the headline of third quarter, we made little progress over the last 90 days. And I would just recap to because, I think, their economic consequences substantial. The fact that we got Canada out the door from a systems perspective is significant. As we've talked about, that's the next important step to realizing that $125 million of benefits. I would say we've seen productivity improvements beyond what I would have expected where we are in deployment already. And the second really important strategic item that we're able to make progress on in the third quarter, to question, was of the integration of Borderfree. We talked about $25 million to $30 million of synergies over the next 18 months. Collectively those 2 items represent $150 million benefit. So as I said you'll get fluctuations and a little bit of noise quarter-to-quarter, but our focus and our perspective is squarely on the long-term creation of shareholder value.

We did this for a very simple reason: The strategy is working. Over the last 30 months, our strategy and importantly, our execution has increased the market value of Pitney Bowes by nearly $2 billion while dramatically improving our balance sheet. We remain focused on the same basic 3 pillars of our strategy. It is in that context that I will make my remarks about what we have accomplished in the last 90 days.
In terms of the stabilization of mail and what we refine to be the reinvention of mail, we continued to make progress on the third quarter. In North America, which, as you know, is the engine of our cash production, the rate of revenue decline continued to moderate to less than 2% on a constant currency basis. This is within the long-term range that we have pointed to. And more importantly, equipment sales, which are the harbinger of future revenue performance, increased in the third quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but this was an important turning point for us.
Likewise, our International Mailing business continued to recover from the disruption from the go-to-market change as we foreshadowed in our second quarter recap and reiterated at Analyst Day. We expect this trend to continue. Our enterprise business, Presort and Production Mail, operated within the long-term band that we laid out in 2013, and we reiterated it a couple of weeks ago. Worth noting, our Presort business continued to perform well and is delivering a very high level of client satisfaction. 
Finally, consistent with our notion of reinventing our mail business, we have several important product announcements leveraging our digital technologies into our installed base. We've just scratched the surface of this important opportunity.
In terms of operational excellence, we continue to hit the ball. Gross and EBIT margins both increased, and cash flow was solid. We will never be done with our operational excellence initiatives, but we are making good progress here more to do with solid progress.
Also as important, in early October, we went live with our systems project in Canada. As Mike described at Analyst Day, this is much more than an ERP project. This is a total retool of our business processes, along with the accompanying technology to automate these processes. Results are early, and we still have a lot of work to do, but the results in Canada have been very encouraging. We are already seeing productivity improvements after a couple of weeks, and the problems have been less than what I have seen in other similar projects. And I've seen a lot of them. I will reiterate that we are early in our deployment, but so far, so good. As we said before, this project is key to delivering a superior client experience and unlocking substantial shareholder value.
In terms of growth in our Digital Commerce businesses, we grew double digits at constant currency in our integration of Borderfree, and the realization of the planned synergies are on track. We're also working with new clients that hold promise of real opportunity in the future. That said, our cross-border business continued to face headwinds, which had a negative effect on our revenue results. 
Our Software business executed well, but that we had a tough compare. In our shipping business we did not execute as well as I would have liked. On balance, however, across the segment, our performance was reasonable, although we're definitely working to overcome some external issues around currencies. 
In conclusion, as always, there are some positives and negatives about the quarter, and I consider our quarterly execution an important indicator. That being said, however, our progress against our strategic work list remains on track. I will now turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. I",2212,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. 
North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. International Mailing's revenue trend improved from prior quarters. And as a result, total SMB revenue on a constant currency basis declined at its lowest rate in 6 quarters, a further indication of the stabilization of our mailing businesses. Presort Services and Global Ecommerce both continued to deliver revenue growth. And each of our business segment groups, SMB, enterprise and Digital Commerce, had revenue performance that was within the long-term market growth rate ranges that I outlined at our Analyst Day.
Also, as we discussed at Analyst Day in our last earnings call, we have launched several new products and services across our businesses that bring our technologies and solutions to broader parts of our client base. Additionally, we've been working to expand our Presort operation, recently adding 2 new sites to our network. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make significant progress against our long-term strategic objectives. To cite a few examples, our ERP project team has worked countless hours to deliver a successful go-live launch of our new ERP platform in Canada early in October. Likewise, our Global Ecommerce management team has been working diligently to integrate the Pitney Bowes and Borderfree businesses while identifying and achieving cost synergies. In our Mailing business in France, we transitioned to a new sales model. And in our Software business, we continue to offer new targeted solutions for enterprise clients, including our newly EngageOne Video software solution. 
Now let me take you through our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide a little more detail around our outlook for the balance of the year. As with the first half of the year, currency, again, had a meaningful impact on the comparisons of our reported results for the quarter. Additionally, as a reminder, revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the sale of Imagitas and the acquisition of Borderfree last quarter. While both of these businesses had similar revenue profiles on an annual basis, seasonally, Imagitas has its best revenue performance in the third quarter, and Borderfree has its best revenue performance in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or 4% and our earnings per share by $0.02. Year-to-date, currency has reduced revenue by $105 million or 4% and earnings per share by $0.05. Beyond these translation effects, the strong U.S. dollar has continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our e-commerce business. 
Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions we took in Europe last year unfavorably impacted our revenue comparisons by approximately $4 million this quarter. While this did not have a meaningful impact on our total revenue comparison, it did impact more meaningfully the individual segments, which I will discuss shortly. This is the last quarter to be affected by these year-over-year comparisons. 
Before I review the results of the quarter in more detail, I want to remind you that the company's third quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Now turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $870 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 3% in SMB Solutions and was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 10% in Digital Commerce Solutions. As I mentioned at the outset of my discussion, these growth rates are all in line with the long-term market growth rates I presented at Analyst Day and are an improvement from the second quarter. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% in SMB Solutions and 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Reported revenue in Digital Commerce Solutions grew 6%. 
Gross margin this quarter was 58.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points from prior year, driven in part by growth in the high-margin mail finishing equipment in North America SMB, Production Mail and service sales globally and the addition of Borderfree revenue in our e-commerce business. 
SG&A this quarter totaled $309 million, which was a reduction of $33 million from the prior year despite the inclusion of about $4 million of amortization of intangibles expense for Borderfree and higher spend related to our Canada ERP go-live preparation. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by 70 basis points, further evidence of the success of our continued focus on operational excellence. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $38 million, which was a decline of more than $4 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $173 million. And adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year despite the adverse impact of currency, the loss of high-margin Imagitas income and the Borderfree and ERP items I just noted. Adding back total depreciation and amortization for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $215 million.
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.4% compared to 16% in the prior year. As a reminder, prior year's tax rate included $16 million in tax benefits from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, the 2014 effective tax rate would have been 28.3%.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS were $0.43. Prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and included $0.08 per share of tax benefits that I just referenced. When you exclude those tax benefits, last year's adjusted EPS were also $0.43.
GAAP EPS were $0.44 and included a $0.01 per share net tax benefit primarily related to the previous divestiture of an investment and some additional acquisition and disposition-related transaction cost. Earnings per share this quarter were adversely impacted by a $0.02 per share reduction related to currency translation. As expected, earnings per share were also impacted by the loss of 3 months of Imagitas earnings, which were estimated to be approximately $0.03 per share and $0.01 per share of expense for the amortization of intangibles related to Borderfree. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slides.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $131 million, and cash provided by operating activities was $150 million on a GAAP basis. When compared to the prior year, third quarter free cash flow was higher, primarily due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital expenditures from a reduced level of investment in ERP this quarter.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of total debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $750 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Included in total debt at the end of the quarter was $150 million in commercial paper outstanding. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $286 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.22%, which was a slight reduction of 6 basis points from the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $38 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, repurchased 4.9 million shares for $100 million and made $15 million in restructuring payments. Also, during the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100 million of share repurchase.
Turning to our business segment results. For SMB Solutions in North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $353 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined just 1.6% on a constant currency basis and less than 3% on a reported basis, which was the lowest rate of decline in 6 quarters. Revenue benefited from 2% growth in equipment sales as productivity continues to improve. Recurring revenue stream trends also continue to be in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.1%, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business, organizational streamlining and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $105 million, and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant currency basis and 21% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 7%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. The rate of decline in revenue is stabilizing in most of the major markets where the go-to-market resource shift has been completed. We focused on transitioning the sales organization in France during the quarter, which is expected to improve productivity. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was a decline of 190 basis points from prior year due to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some costs and the temporary incremental cost of transitioning the sales organization in France.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $102 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 4%, excluding currency and the divested revenue in Europe related to this segment. Inserting equipment sales grew versus prior year. However, there were no production print installations during the quarter, which adversely impacted revenue. Revenue also declined, partly due to lower support services revenue this quarter. EBIT margin was 12.2%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to the mix of high-margin inserting equipment sales as well as ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $116 million, and EBIT was $26 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of First Class and Standard mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 22.4%, which was an improvement of 270 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $98 million, and EBIT was $15 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, revenue comparisons were impacted by lower licensing revenue in the Americas when compared to the prior year, which included a large licensing deal. Excluding the impact of that deal, software results were positive and in line with expectation as the business is acquiring new enterprise clients through targeted industry and application-specific solutions. EBIT margin was 15%, a decline of 190 basis points from prior year as a result of lower licensing revenue, which carries a higher margin.
For the Global Ecommerce segment, revenue was $97 million, and EBIT was a loss of $1 million. Revenue grew 36% on a constant currency basis and 34% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and the continued expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service.
Outbound package shipments from the U.S. continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. EBIT margin was a negative 1%, which was relatively flat to prior year despite incremental expenses, including the amortization of intangibles as well as expense and investments related to the Borderfree acquisition. These incremental expenses offset benefits from initial integration synergies during the quarter. The other segment is comprised of the Imagitas marketing services business, which was sold in May of this year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to focus the discussion on guidance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect the improving trends experienced in the third quarter to continue and further improve in the fourth quarter as a result of the actions we've taken to achieve our long-term strategic initiatives. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We are modifying our revenue guidance for the following reasons: First, the relatively strong U.S. dollar continues to impact cross-border e-commerce purchases through our U.S.-based e-commerce business. Second, we are still working through the SMB go-to-market transition in France. We substantially transitioned the sales organization by the end of the third quarter, but there's still more to do to achieve the productivity levels we are targeting. And third, the uncertain global economic environment is impacting some capital investment decision, which is impacting our Production Mail and software businesses. Therefore, we now expect annual revenue to be in the range of flat to a decline of 2% when compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis. 
As I noted, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year as operational excellence initiatives are expected to drive further cost reductions and efficiencies in the business. Adjusted EPS is still expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90, and GAAP EPS is still expected to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21 for the year. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

I think, as always, there's a dose of each one of the elements that you described. To start with, the end user market, there's no doubt that the end user market opportunity is under some level of pressures. You see particularly businesses continue to move their production to service bureaus, and that has a short-term dynamic on revenue. That said, I would say that longer term, we think we're uniquely positioned to provide value to those service bureaus. So while it's disruptive in the short term, it is something, I think, in the long term that will then adjust. The second point I would make is that we've been shy on printer sales this week -- this year. Printers are something that affect the top line in a fairly material way, but obviously, as you know, don't come with a lot of profit. And as we focus ourselves on driving revenue with profit, we have walked away from some of those opportunities that would make economic sense for us. So as we've always said, it's going to be a lumpy business. It was not great from a top line perspective in the third quarter and pretty darn good from a profit perspective. And we like our hand going forward."

To Marc's comment on go-to-market, obviously, a component of go-to-market is our sales activities around supplies. And we put a real focus on that and has had good performance there. The other thing benefiting supplies is in our Production Mail business, even though we didn't have any placements of printers in the quarter, as we built an installed base of printers out there, that drives supplies revenue as well. So that was a positive. And as we achieve future placements, that helps build an incremental recurring revenue stream. With respect to rentals, I would say you are seeing the stabilization, certainly, in the North American Mailing business. On the international side, that's been impacted somewhat by the go-to-market, particularly in France, which is the other key market where we see rental. So to Marc's earlier comments, as we see stabilization in those markets, and particularly in France, on a go-forward basis, that should help over time with rentals. And as you know, rentals and the other recurring revenue streams tend not to move as dramatically quarter-to-quarter because of an installed base than, say, the equipment sales line."

And what will take a little bit longer is to integrate the 2 platforms. So that's something, obviously, is a more heavy lift. And given how important the fourth quarter is to our clients, we're not likely to make any changes to the platform until next year. If you look at it from a financial perspective, and we talked about $25 million to $30 million of synergies, we're on track with that. And as I said at Analyst Day and -- before, there's $25 million to $30 million around the cost side. As we get deeper into it, we're starting to see some opportunities on the revenue side as well. So I would say, from a financial perspective, the integration is on track. We like what we've seen so far.

So as you think about the new channels that we've put inside them, inside sales, another year is meaningful in terms of their ability to drive productivity. The second thing I would say is that we have only scratched the surface of what we can do with the web. The web is something that we've spent the last couple of years building our capabilities, relaunched the web. And we've got a lot that we can do there not only in terms of driving more efficiency in our sales organization, but more efficiency in our service organization, more efficiency on our call operations. And we have a, I would say, a very detailed piece of work that Mike is leading on our behalf. In terms of changes to the comp, not really. We continue to fine tune that. But I think our primary levers of productivity are, as I described, the maturation of the inside sales channel and the coming online of the web channel. So I -- there's still a lot we can do here. And we always talk about impact in our ERP project in parallel with our go-to-market changes. There's connections between those 2.

Software businesses are never even quarter-to-quarter, particularly the ones that are starting with the level of scale that we have. The next move for them is to kind of think where we started with. And in general, the product specialists, the next turn of the crank is to go from product specialist to solution sales. So let me give an example of what that means. So we have our customer information management businesses. That's a line of business. It's a product specialty, if you will. As they mature their channel, they'll move from product specialists that know those products inside out to people that know about money-laundering and know your customer and other types of application areas that become important to the client. So I can get the predicate of your question looking at the third quarter results. I would say that they've hit the ball fairly consistent with what we think our long-term expectations are over the last couple of years. And they had more opportunities for productivity. The other thing that, tat will help, and we haven't talked about a lot, is we've not done as well the sharing of services business in software as we had planned.

As we pointed to at Analyst Day, we expected the third quarter to be better than the first half and the fourth quarter to be further improvement from there, and I think that's the way it's going to turn out. 
In terms of our strategic road map, and I think this is the headline of the third quarter, we made little progress over the last 90 days. And I would just recap, too, because I think their economic consequences are substantial. The fact that we got Canada out the door from a systems perspective is significant. As we've talked about, that's the next important step to realizing that $125 million of benefits. I would say we've seen productivity improvements beyond what I would have expected where we are in deployment already. And the second really important strategic item that we were able to make progress on in the third quarter, to Shannon's question, was the integration of Borderfree. We've talked about $25 million to $30 million of synergies over the next 18 months. Collectively, those 2 items represent a $150 million benefit. So as I said, you'll get fluctuations and a little bit noise quarter-to-quarter, but our focus and our perspective is squarely on the long-term creation of shareholder value.

We did this for a very simple reason: The strategy is working. Over the last 30 months, our strategy and importantly, our execution has increased the market value of Pitney Bowes by nearly $2 billion while dramatically improving our balance sheet. We remain focused on the same basic 3 pillars of our strategy. It is in that context that I will make my remarks about what we have accomplished in the last 90 days.
In terms of the stabilization of mail and what we refine to be the reinvention of mail, we continued to make progress on the third quarter. In North America, which, as you know, is the engine of our cash production, the rate of revenue decline continued to moderate to less than 2% on a constant currency basis. This is within the long-term range that we have pointed to. And more importantly, equipment sales, which are the harbinger of future revenue performance, increased in the third quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but this was an important turning point for us.
Likewise, our International Mailing business continued to recover from the disruption from the go-to-market change as we foreshadowed in our second quarter recap and reiterated at Analyst Day. We expect this trend to continue. Our enterprise business, Presort and Production Mail, operated within the long-term band that we laid out in 2013, and we reiterated it a couple of weeks ago. Worth noting, our Presort business continued to perform well and is delivering a very high level of client satisfaction. 
Finally, consistent with our notion of reinventing our mail business, we have several important product announcements leveraging our digital technologies into our installed base. We've just scratched the surface of this important opportunity.
In terms of operational excellence, we continue to hit the ball. Gross and EBIT margins both increased, and cash flow was solid. We will never be done with our operational excellence initiatives, but we are making good progress here more to do with solid progress.
Also as important, in early October, we went live with our systems project in Canada. As Mike described at Analyst Day, this is much more than an ERP project. This is a total retool of our business processes, along with the accompanying technology to automate these processes. Results are early, and we still have a lot of work to do, but the results in Canada have been very encouraging. We are already seeing productivity improvements after a couple of weeks, and the problems have been less than what I have seen in other similar projects. And I've seen a lot of them. I will reiterate that we are early in our deployment, but so far, so good. As we said before, this project is key to delivering a superior client experience and unlocking substantial shareholder value.
In terms of growth in our Digital Commerce businesses, we grew double digits at constant currency in our integration of Borderfree, and the realization of the planned synergies are on track. We're also working with new clients that hold promise of real opportunity in the future. That said, our cross-border business continued to face headwinds, which had a negative effect on our revenue results. 
Our Software business executed well, but that we had a tough compare. In our shipping business we did not execute as well as I would have liked. On balance, however, across the segment, our performance was reasonable, although we're definitely working to overcome some external issues around currencies. 
In conclusion, as always, there are some positives and negatives about the quarter, and I consider our quarterly execution an important indicator. That being said, however, our progress against our strategic work list remains on track. I will now turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. I",2212,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. 
North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. International Mailing's revenue trend improved from prior quarters. And as a result, total SMB revenue on a constant currency basis declined at its lowest rate in 6 quarters, a further indication of the stabilization of our mailing businesses. Presort Services and Global Ecommerce both continued to deliver revenue growth. And each of our business segment groups, SMB, enterprise and Digital Commerce, had revenue performance that was within the long-term market growth rate ranges that I outlined at our Analyst Day.
Also, as we discussed at Analyst Day and our last earnings call, we have launched several new products and services across our businesses that bring our technologies and solutions to broader parts of our client base. Additionally, we've been working to expand our Presort operation, recently adding 2 new sites to our network. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make significant progress against our long-term strategic objectives. To cite a few examples, our ERP project team has worked countless hours to deliver a successful go-live launch of our new ERP platform in Canada early in October. Likewise, our Global Ecommerce management team has been working diligently to integrate the Pitney Bowes and Borderfree businesses while identifying and achieving cost synergies. In our Mailing business in France, we transitioned to a new sales model. And in our Software business, we continue to offer new targeted solutions for enterprise clients, including our newly EngageOne Video software solution. 
Now let me take you through our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide a little more detail around our outlook for the balance of the year. As with the first half of the year, currency, again, had a meaningful impact on the comparisons of our reported results for the quarter. Additionally, as a reminder, revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the sale of Imagitas and the acquisition of Borderfree last quarter. While both of these businesses had similar revenue profiles on an annual basis, seasonally, Imagitas has its best revenue performance in the third quarter, and Borderfree has its best revenue performance in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or 4% and our earnings per share by $0.02. Year-to-date, currency has reduced revenue by $105 million or 4% and earnings per share by $0.05. Beyond these translation effects, the strong U.S. dollar has continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our e-commerce business. 
Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions we took in Europe last year unfavorably impacted our revenue comparisons by approximately $4 million this quarter. While this did not have a meaningful impact on our total revenue comparison, it did impact more meaningfully the individual segments, which I will discuss shortly. This is the last quarter to be affected by these year-over-year comparisons. 
Before I review the results of the quarter in more detail, I want to remind you that the company's third quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Now turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $870 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 3% in SMB Solutions and was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 10% in Digital Commerce Solutions. As I mentioned at the outset of my discussion, these growth rates are all in line with the long-term market growth rates I presented at Analyst Day and are an improvement from the second quarter. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% in SMB Solutions and 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Reported revenue in Digital Commerce Solutions grew 6%. 
Gross margin this quarter was 58.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points from prior year, driven in part by growth in the high-margin mail finishing equipment in North America SMB, Production Mail and service sales globally and the addition of Borderfree revenue in our e-commerce business. 
SG&A this quarter totaled $309 million, which was a reduction of $33 million from the prior year despite the inclusion of about $4 million of amortization of intangibles expense for Borderfree and higher spend related to our Canada ERP go-live preparation. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by 70 basis points, further evidence of the success of our continued focus on operational excellence. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $38 million, which was a decline of more than $4 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $173 million. And adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year despite the adverse impact of currency, the loss of high-margin Imagitas income and the Borderfree and ERP items I just noted. Adding back total depreciation and amortization for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $215 million.
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.4% compared to 16% in the prior year. As a reminder, prior year's tax rate included $16 million in tax benefits from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, the 2014 effective tax rate would have been 28.3%.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS were $0.43. Prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and included $0.08 per share of tax benefits that I just referenced. When you exclude those tax benefits, last year's adjusted EPS were also $0.43.
GAAP EPS were $0.44 and included a $0.01 per share net tax benefit primarily related to the previous divestiture of an investment and some additional acquisition and disposition-related transaction costs. Earnings per share this quarter were adversely impacted by a $0.02 per share reduction related to currency translation. As expected, earnings per share were also impacted by the loss of 3 months of Imagitas earnings, which were estimated to be approximately $0.03 per share and $0.01 per share of expense for the amortization of intangibles related to Borderfree. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slides.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $131 million, and cash provided by operating activities was $150 million on a GAAP basis. When compared to the prior year, third quarter free cash flow was higher, primarily due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital expenditures from a reduced level of investment in ERP this quarter.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of total debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $750 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Included in total debt at the end of the quarter was $150 million in commercial paper outstanding. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $286 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.22%, which was a slight reduction of 6 basis points from the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $38 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, repurchased 4.9 million shares for $100 million and made $15 million in restructuring payments. Also, during the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100 million of share repurchase.
Turning to our business segment results. For SMB Solutions in North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $353 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined just 1.6% on a constant currency basis and less than 3% on a reported basis, which was the lowest rate of decline in 6 quarters. Revenue benefited from 2% growth in equipment sales as productivity continues to improve. Recurring revenue stream trends also continue to be in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.1%, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business, organizational streamlining and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $105 million, and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant currency basis and 21% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 7%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. The rate of decline in revenue is stabilizing in most of the major markets where the go-to-market resource shift has been completed. We focused on transitioning the sales organization in France during the quarter, which is expected to improve productivity. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was a decline of 190 basis points from prior year due to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some costs and the temporary incremental cost of transitioning the sales organization in France.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $102 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 4%, excluding currency and the divested revenue in Europe related to this segment. Inserting equipment sales grew versus prior year. However, there were no production print installations during the quarter, which adversely impacted revenue. Revenue also declined, partly due to lower support services revenue this quarter. EBIT margin was 12.2%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to the mix of high-margin inserting equipment sales as well as ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $116 million, and EBIT was $26 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of First Class and Standard mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 22.4%, which was an improvement of 270 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $98 million, and EBIT was $15 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, revenue comparisons were impacted by lower licensing revenue in the Americas when compared to the prior year, which included a large licensing deal. Excluding the impact of that deal, software results were positive and in line with expectation as the business is acquiring new enterprise clients through targeted industry and application-specific solutions. EBIT margin was 15%, a decline of 190 basis points from prior year as a result of lower licensing revenue, which carries a higher margin.
For the Global Ecommerce segment, revenue was $97 million, and EBIT was a loss of $1 million. Revenue grew 36% on a constant currency basis and 34% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and the continued expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service.
Outbound package shipments from the U.S. continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. EBIT margin was a negative 1%, which was relatively flat to prior year despite incremental expenses, including the amortization of intangibles as well as expense and investments related to the Borderfree acquisition. These incremental expenses offset benefits from initial integration synergies during the quarter. The other segment is comprised of the Imagitas marketing services business, which was sold in May of this year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to focus the discussion on guidance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect the improving trends experienced in the third quarter to continue and further improve in the fourth quarter as a result of the actions we've taken to achieve our long-term strategic initiatives. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We are modifying our revenue guidance for the following reasons: First, the relatively strong U.S. dollar continues to impact cross-border e-commerce purchases through our U.S.-based e-commerce business. Second, we are still working through the SMB go-to-market transition in France. We substantially transitioned the sales organization by the end of the third quarter, but there's still more to do to achieve the productivity levels we are targeting. And third, the uncertain global economic environment is impacting some capital investment decisions, which is impacting our Production Mail and software businesses. Therefore, we now expect annual revenue to be in the range of flat to a decline of 2% when compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis. 
As I noted, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year as operational excellence initiatives are expected to drive further cost reductions and efficiencies in the business. Adjusted EPS is still expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90, and GAAP EPS is still expected to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21 for the year. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

I think, as always, there's a dose of each one of the elements that you described. To start with, the end user market, there's no doubt that the end user market opportunity is under some level of pressures. You see particularly businesses continue to move their production to service bureaus, and that has a short-term dynamic on revenue. That said, I would say that longer term, we think we're uniquely positioned to provide value to those service bureaus. So while it's disruptive in the short term, it is something, I think, in the long term that will then adjust. The second point I would make is that we've been shy on printer sales this week -- this year. Printers are something that affect the top line in a fairly material way, but obviously, as you know, don't come with a lot of profit. And as we focus ourselves on driving revenue with profit, we have walked away from some of those opportunities that wouldn't make economic sense for us. So as we've always said, it's going to be a lumpy business. It was not great from a top line perspective in the third quarter and pretty darn good from a profit perspective. And we like our hand going forward."

To Marc's comment on go-to-market, obviously, a component of go-to-market is our sales activities around supplies. And we put a real focus on that and has had good performance there. The other thing benefiting supplies is in our Production Mail business, even though we didn't have any placements of printers in the quarter, as we built an installed base of printers out there, that drives supplies revenue as well. So that was a positive. And as we achieve future placements, that helps build an incremental recurring revenue stream. With respect to rentals, I would say you are seeing the stabilization, certainly, in the North American Mailing business. On the international side, that's been impacted somewhat by the go-to-market, particularly in France, which is the other key market where we see rental. So to Marc's earlier comments, as we see stabilization in those markets, and particularly in France, on a go-forward basis, that should help over time with rentals. And as you know, rentals and the other recurring revenue streams tend not to move as dramatically quarter-to-quarter because of an installed base than, say, the equipment sales line might,."

I would say, Allen, there is significant opportunity from a margin standpoint. As Marc noted, in the short term, we even have some duplicative cost around the market like France as we transition people out. But certainly, there will be benefits associated with our ERP implementation as well. I would say it's difficult to get the international business to the level of the North American business just by the nature of two things, really: one, in the North American business, we have the rental of postage meters, which creates an additional recurring revenue stream that's not as predominant in Europe. We tend to have it in France, but not in most of the other markets. That's number one. Number two is just some infrastructure redundancy because you have to maintain some level of local country product and sales and service infrastructure. But we do see the opportunity within our ERP implementation and really managing this business more as a global platform than a regional platform to substantially improve the margin profile in that business."

The second thing I would say is that we have only scratched the surface of what we can do with the web. The web is something that we've spent the last couple of years building our capabilities, relaunched the web. And we've got a lot that we can do there not only in terms of driving more efficiency in our sales organization, but more efficiency in our service organization, more efficiency on our call operations. And we have a, I would say, a very detailed piece of work that Mike is leading on our behalf. In terms of changes to the comp, not really. We continue to fine tune that.

And in general, the product specialists, the next turn of the crank is to go from product specialist to solution sales. So let me give an example of what that means. So we have our customer information management businesses. That's a line of business. It's a product specialty, if you will. As they mature their channel, they'll move from product specialists that know those products inside out to people that know about money-laundering and know your customer and other types of application areas that become important to the client. So I can get the predicate of your question looking at the third quarter results. I would say that they've hit the ball fairly consistent with what we think our long-term expectations are over the last couple of years. And they had more opportunities for productivity. The other thing that, tat will help, and we haven't talked about a lot, is we've not done as well the sharing of services business in software as we had planned.

As we pointed to at Analyst Day, we expected the third quarter to be better than the first half and the fourth quarter to be further improvement from there, and I think that's the way it's going to turn out. 
In terms of our strategic road map, and I think this is the headline of the third quarter, we made little progress over the last 90 days. And I would just recap, too, because I think their economic consequences are substantial. The fact that we got Canada out the door from a systems perspective is significant. As we've talked about, that's the next important step to realizing that $125 million of benefits. I would say we've seen productivity improvements beyond what I would have expected where we are in deployment already. And the second really important strategic item that we were able to make progress on in the third quarter, to Shannon's question, was the integration of Borderfree. We've talked about $25 million to $30 million of synergies over the next 18 months. Collectively, those 2 items represent a $150 million benefit. So as I said, you'll get fluctuations and a little bit noise quarter-to-quarter, but our focus and our perspective is squarely on the long-term creation of shareholder value.

We did this for a very simple reason: The strategy is working. Over the last 30 months, our strategy and importantly, our execution has increased the market value of Pitney Bowes by nearly $2 billion while dramatically improving our balance sheet. We remain focused on the same basic 3 pillars of our strategy. It is in that context that I will make my remarks about what we have accomplished in the last 90 days.
In terms of the stabilization of mail and what we refine to be the reinvention of mail, we continued to make progress on the third quarter. In North America, which, as you know, is the engine of our cash production, the rate of revenue decline continued to moderate to less than 2% on a constant currency basis. This is within the long-term range that we have pointed to. And more importantly, equipment sales, which are the harbinger of future revenue performance, increased in the third quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but this was an important turning point for us.
Likewise, our International Mailing business continued to recover from the disruption from the go-to-market change as we foreshadowed in our second quarter recap and reiterated at Analyst Day. We expect this trend to continue. Our enterprise business, Presort and Production Mail, operated within the long-term band that we laid out in 2013, and we reiterated it a couple of weeks ago. Worth noting, our Presort business continued to perform well and is delivering a very high level of client satisfaction. 
Finally, consistent with our notion of reinventing our mail business, we have several important product announcements leveraging our digital technologies into our installed base. We've just scratched the surface of this important opportunity.
In terms of operational excellence, we continue to hit the ball. Gross and EBIT margins both increased, and cash flow was solid. We will never be done with our operational excellence initiatives, but we are making good progress here more to do with solid progress.
Also as important, in early October, we went live with our systems project in Canada. As Mike described at Analyst Day, this is much more than an ERP project. This is a total retool of our business processes, along with the accompanying technology to automate these processes. Results are early, and we still have a lot of work to do, but the results in Canada have been very encouraging. We are already seeing productivity improvements after a couple of weeks, and the problems have been less than what I have seen in other similar projects. And I've seen a lot of them. I will reiterate that we are early in our deployment, but so far, so good. As we said before, this project is key to delivering a superior client experience and unlocking substantial shareholder value.
In terms of growth in our Digital Commerce businesses, we grew double digits at constant currency in our integration of Borderfree, and the realization of the planned synergies are on track. We're also working with new clients that hold promise of real opportunity in the future. That said, our cross-border business continued to face headwinds, which had a negative effect on our revenue results. 
Our Software business executed well, but that we had a tough compare. In our shipping business we did not execute as well as I would have liked. On balance, however, across the segment, our performance was reasonable, although we're definitely working to overcome some external issues around currencies. 
In conclusion, as always, there are some positives and negatives about the quarter, and I consider our quarterly execution an important indicator. That being said, however, our progress against our strategic work list remains on track. I will now turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. I",2212,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. 
North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. International Mailing's revenue trend improved from prior quarters. And as a result, total SMB revenue on a constant currency basis declined at its lowest rate in 6 quarters, a further indication of the stabilization of our mailing businesses. Presort Services and Global Ecommerce both continued to deliver revenue growth. And each of our business segment groups, SMB, enterprise and Digital Commerce, had revenue performance that was within the long-term market growth rate ranges that I outlined at our Analyst Day.
Also, as we discussed at Analyst Day and our last earnings call, we have launched several new products and services across our businesses that bring our technologies and solutions to broader parts of our client base. Additionally, we've been working to expand our Presort operation, recently adding 2 new sites to our network. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make significant progress against our long-term strategic objectives. To cite a few examples, our ERP project team has worked countless hours to deliver a successful go-live launch of our new ERP platform in Canada early in October. Likewise, our Global Ecommerce management team has been working diligently to integrate the Pitney Bowes and Borderfree businesses while identifying and achieving cost synergies. In our Mailing business in France, we transitioned to a new sales model. And in our Software business, we continue to offer new targeted solutions for enterprise clients, including our newly EngageOne Video software solution. 
Now let me take you through our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide a little more detail around our outlook for the balance of the year. As with the first half of the year, currency, again, had a meaningful impact on the comparisons of our reported results for the quarter. Additionally, as a reminder, revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the sale of Imagitas and the acquisition of Borderfree last quarter. While both of these businesses had similar revenue profiles on an annual basis, seasonally, Imagitas has its best revenue performance in the third quarter, and Borderfree has its best revenue performance in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or 4% and our earnings per share by $0.02. Year-to-date, currency has reduced revenue by $105 million or 4% and earnings per share by $0.05. Beyond these translation effects, the strong U.S. dollar has continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our e-commerce business. 
Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions we took in Europe last year unfavorably impacted our revenue comparisons by approximately $4 million this quarter. While this did not have a meaningful impact on our total revenue comparison, it did impact more meaningfully the individual segments, which I will discuss shortly. This is the last quarter to be affected by these year-over-year comparisons. 
Before I review the results of the quarter in more detail, I want to remind you that the company's third quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides, can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Now turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $870 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 3% in SMB Solutions and was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 10% in Digital Commerce Solutions. As I mentioned at the outset of my discussion, these growth rates are all in line with the long-term market growth rates I presented at Analyst Day and are an improvement from the second quarter. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% in SMB Solutions and 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Reported revenue in Digital Commerce Solutions grew 6%. 
Gross margin this quarter was 58.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points from prior year, driven in part by growth in the high-margin mail finishing equipment in North America SMB, Production Mail and service sales globally and the addition of Borderfree revenue in our e-commerce business. 
SG&A this quarter totaled $309 million, which was a reduction of $33 million from the prior year despite the inclusion of about $4 million of amortization of intangibles expense for Borderfree and higher spend related to our Canada ERP go-live preparation. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by 70 basis points, further evidence of the success of our continued focus on operational excellence. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $38 million, which was a decline of more than $4 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $173 million. And adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year despite the adverse impact of currency, the loss of high-margin Imagitas income and the Borderfree and ERP items I just noted. Adding back total depreciation and amortization for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $215 million.
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.4% compared to 16% in the prior year. As a reminder, prior year's tax rate included $16 million in tax benefits from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, the 2014 effective tax rate would have been 28.3%.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS were $0.43. Prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and included $0.08 per share of tax benefits that I just referenced. When you exclude those tax benefits, last year's adjusted EPS were also $0.43.
GAAP EPS were $0.44 and included a $0.01 per share net tax benefit primarily related to the previous divestiture of an investment and some additional acquisition and disposition-related transaction costs. Earnings per share this quarter were adversely impacted by a $0.02 per share reduction related to currency translation. As expected, earnings per share were also impacted by the loss of 3 months of Imagitas earnings, which were estimated to be approximately $0.03 per share and $0.01 per share of expense for the amortization of intangibles related to Borderfree. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slides.
Looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $131 million, and cash provided by operating activities was $150 million on a GAAP basis. When compared to the prior year, third quarter free cash flow was higher, primarily due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital expenditures from a reduced level of investment in ERP this quarter.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of total debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $750 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Included in total debt at the end of the quarter was $150 million in commercial paper outstanding. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $286 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.22%, which was a slight reduction of 6 basis points from the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $38 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, repurchased 4.9 million shares for $100 million and made $15 million in restructuring payments. Also, during the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100 million of share repurchase.
Turning to our business segment results. For SMB Solutions in North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $353 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined just 1.6% on a constant currency basis and less than 3% on a reported basis, which was the lowest rate of decline in 6 quarters. Revenue benefited from 2% growth in equipment sales as productivity continues to improve. Recurring revenue stream trends also continue to be in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.1%, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business, organizational streamlining and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $105 million, and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant currency basis and 21% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 7%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. The rate of decline in revenue is stabilizing in most of the major markets where the go-to-market resource shift has been completed. We focused on transitioning the sales organization in France during the quarter, which is expected to improve productivity. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was a decline of 190 basis points from prior year due to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some costs and the temporary incremental cost of transitioning the sales organization in France.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $102 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 4%, excluding currency and the divested revenue in Europe related to this segment. Inserting equipment sales grew versus prior year. However, there were no production print installations during the quarter, which adversely impacted revenue. Revenue also declined, partly due to lower support services revenue this quarter. EBIT margin was 12.2%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to the mix of high-margin inserting equipment sales as well as ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $116 million, and EBIT was $26 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of First Class and Standard mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 22.4%, which was an improvement of 270 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $98 million, and EBIT was $15 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, revenue comparisons were impacted by lower licensing revenue in the Americas when compared to the prior year, which included a large licensing deal. Excluding the impact of that deal, software results were positive and in line with expectation as the business is acquiring new enterprise clients through targeted industry and application-specific solutions. EBIT margin was 15%, a decline of 190 basis points from prior year as a result of lower licensing revenue, which carries a higher margin.
For the Global Ecommerce segment, revenue was $97 million, and EBIT was a loss of $1 million. Revenue grew 36% on a constant currency basis and 34% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and the continued expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service.
Outbound package shipments from the U.S. continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. EBIT margin was a negative 1%, which was relatively flat to prior year despite incremental expenses, including the amortization of intangibles as well as expense and investments related to the Borderfree acquisition. These incremental expenses offset benefits from initial integration synergies during the quarter. The other segment is comprised of the Imagitas marketing services business, which was sold in May of this year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to focus the discussion on guidance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect the improving trends experienced in the third quarter to continue and further improve in the fourth quarter as a result of the actions we've taken to achieve our long-term strategic initiatives. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We are modifying our revenue guidance for the following reasons: First, the relatively strong U.S. dollar continues to impact cross-border e-commerce purchases through our U.S.-based e-commerce business. Second, we are still working through the SMB go-to-market transition in France. We substantially transitioned the sales organization by the end of the third quarter, but there's still more to do to achieve the productivity levels we are targeting. And third, the uncertain global economic environment is impacting some capital investment decisions, which is impacting our Production Mail and software businesses. Therefore, we now expect annual revenue to be in the range of flat to a decline of 2% when compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis. 
As I noted, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year as operational excellence initiatives are expected to drive further cost reductions and efficiencies in the business. Adjusted EPS is still expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90, and GAAP EPS is still expected to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21 for the year. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

I think, as always, there's a dose of each one of the elements that you described. To start with, the end user market, there's no doubt that the end user market opportunity is under some level of pressures. You see particularly businesses continue to move their production to service bureaus, and that has a short-term dynamic on revenue. That said, I would say that longer term, we think we're uniquely positioned to provide value to those service bureaus. So while it's disruptive in the short term, it is something, I think, in the long term that will then adjust. The second point I would make is that we've been shy on printer sales this week -- this year. Printers are something that affect the top line in a fairly material way, but obviously, as you know, don't come with a lot of profit. And as we focus ourselves on driving revenue with profit, we have walked away from some of those opportunities that wouldn't make economic sense for us. So as we've always said, it's going to be a lumpy business. It was not great from a top line perspective in the third quarter and pretty darn good from a profit perspective. And we like our hand going forward."

The other thing benefiting supplies is in our Production Mail business, even though we didn't have any placements of printers in the quarter, as we built an installed base of printers out there, that drives supplies revenue as well. So that was a positive. And as we achieve future placements, that helps build an incremental recurring revenue stream. With respect to rentals, I would say you are seeing the stabilization, certainly, in the North American Mailing business. On the international side, that's been impacted somewhat by the go-to-market, particularly in France, which is the other key market where we see rental. So to Marc's earlier comments, as we see stabilization in those markets, and particularly in France, on a go-forward basis, that should help over time with rentals. And as you know, rentals and the other recurring revenue streams tend not to move as dramatically quarter-to-quarter because of an installed base than, say, the equipment sales line might,."

If you look at their performance, they had a really good performance in what I'd say small and medium-size transactions, and that's important because that's a key indicator of how that channel is progressing, how the new go-to-market is progressing. So at the end of the day, revenue is revenue. But if you can get it from a broader array of the channel, then that's why I think the execution [indiscernible] overall numbers are not consistent with the kind of long-term performance that we thought.

As Marc noted, in the short term, we even have some duplicative cost around the market like France as we transition people out. But certainly, there will be benefits associated with our ERP implementation as well. I would say it's difficult to get the international business to the level of the North American business just by the nature of two things, really: one, in the North American business, we have the rental of postage meters, which creates an additional recurring revenue stream that's not as predominant in Europe. We tend to have it in France, but not in most of the other markets. That's number one. Number two is just some infrastructure redundancy because you have to maintain some level of local country product and sales and service infrastructure. But we do see the opportunity within our ERP implementation and really managing this business more as a global platform than a regional platform to substantially improve the margin profile in that business."

So as you think about the new channels that we've put inside and inside sales, another year is meaningful in terms of their ability to drive productivity. The second thing I would say is that we have only scratched the surface of what we can do with the web. The web is something that we've spent the last couple of years building our capabilities, relaunched the web. And we've got a lot that we can do there not only in terms of driving more efficiency in our sales organization, but more efficiency in our service organization, more efficiency on our call operations. And we have a, I would say, a very detailed piece of work that Mike is leading on our behalf. In terms of changes to the comp, not really. We continue to fine tune that. But I think our primary levers of productivity are, as I described, the maturation of the inside sales channel and the coming online of the web channel. So I -- there's still a lot we can do here.

Software businesses are never even quarter-to-quarter, particularly the ones that are starting with the level of scale that we have. The next move for them is to kind of think where we started with. And in general, the product specialists, the next turn of the crank is to go from product specialist to solution sales. So let me give an example of what that means. So we have our customer information management businesses. That's a line of business. It's a product specialty, if you will. As they mature their channel, they'll move from product specialists that know those products inside out to people that know about money-laundering and know your customer and other types of application areas that become important to the client. So I can get the predicate of your question looking at the third quarter results. I would say that they've hit the ball fairly consistent with what we think our long-term expectations are over the last couple of years. And they had more opportunities for productivity.

As we pointed to at Analyst Day, we expected the third quarter to be better than the first half and the fourth quarter to be further improvement from there, and I think that's the way it's going to turn out. 
In terms of our strategic road map, and I think this is the headline of the third quarter, we made little progress over the last 90 days. And I would just recap, too, because I think their economic consequences are substantial. The fact that we got Canada out the door from a systems perspective is significant. As we've talked about, that's the next important step to realizing that $125 million of benefits. I would say we've seen productivity improvements beyond what I would have expected where we are in deployment already. And the second really important strategic item that we were able to make progress on in the third quarter, to Shannon's question, was the integration of Borderfree. We've talked about $25 million to $30 million of synergies over the next 18 months. Collectively, those 2 items represent a $150 million benefit. So as I said, you'll get fluctuations and a little bit noise quarter-to-quarter, but our focus and our perspective is squarely on the long-term creation of shareholder value. 
That will conclude our remarks for today. We'll talk to you in 90 days."

We did this for a very simple reason. The strategy is working. Over the last 30 months, our strategy and importantly, our execution has increased the market value of Pitney Bowes by nearly $2 billion while dramatically improving our balance sheet. We remain focused on the same basic 3 pillars of our strategy. It is in that context that I'll make my remarks about what we have accomplished in the last 90 days.
In terms of the stabilization of mail and what we refine to be the reinvention of mail, we continue to make good progress in the third quarter. In North America, which as you know is the engine of our cash production, the rate of revenue climb continued to moderate to less than 2% on a constant currency basis. This is within the long-term range that we have pointed to. And more importantly, equipment sales, which are the harbinger of future revenue performance, increased in the third quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but this was an important turning point for us.
Likewise, our International Mailing business continued to recover from the disruption from the go-to-market change as we foreshadowed in our second quarter recap and reiterated at Analyst Day. We expect this trend to continue. Our enterprise business, Presort and Production Mail, operated within the long-term band that we laid out in 2013 and reiterated a couple of weeks ago. Worth noting, our Presort business continued to perform well and is delivering a very high level of client satisfaction. 
Finally, consistent with our notion of reinventing our mail business, we have several important product announcements leveraging our digital technologies into our install base. We've just scratched the surface of this important opportunity. In terms of operational excellence, we continue to hit the ball. Gross and EBIT margins both increased, and cash flow was solid. We will never be done with our operational excellence initiatives, but we are making good progress here, more to do but solid progress.
Also of import, in early October, we went live with our systems project in Canada. As Mike described at Analyst Day, this is much more than an ERP project. This is a total retool of our business processes, along with the accompanying technology to automate these processes. Results are early, and we still have a lot of work to do, but the results in Canada have been very encouraging. We are already seeing productivity improvements after a couple weeks, and the problems have been less than what I have seen in other similar projects. And I've seen a lot of them. I will reiterate that we are early in our deployment, but so far, so good. As we said before, this project is key to delivering a superior client experience and unlocking substantial shareholder value.
In terms of growth in our Digital Commerce businesses, we grew double digits at constant currency and our integration of Borderfree and the realization of the planned synergies are on track. We're also working with some new clients that hold promise of real opportunity in the future. That said, our cross-border business continued to face headwinds, which had a negative effect on our revenue results. 
Our Software business executed well, but we had a tough compare. In our shipping business, we did not execute as well as I would have liked. On balance, however, across the segment, our performance was reasonable, although we're definitely working to overcome some external issues around currencies. 
In conclusion, as always, there were some positives and negatives about the quarter, and I consider our quarterly execution an important indicator. That being said, however, our progress against our strategic work list remains on track. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. I",2213,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we saw an improvement in several important business trends during the third quarter and expect these trends to further improve in the fourth quarter. 
North American mailing equipment sales grew 2%. International Mailing's revenue trend improved from prior quarters. And as a result, total SMB revenue on a constant currency basis declined at its lowest rate in 6 quarters, a further indication of the stabilization of our mailing businesses. Presort Services and Global Ecommerce both continued to deliver revenue growth. In each of our business segment groups, SMB, enterprise and Digital Commerce, had revenue performance that was within the long-term market growth rate ranges that I outlined at our Analyst Day.
Also, as we discussed at Analyst Day and our last earnings call, we have launched several new products and services across our businesses that bring our technologies and solutions to broader parts of our client base. Additionally, we've been working to expand our Presort operations, recently adding 2 new sites to our network. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make significant progress against our long-term strategic objectives. To cite a few examples, our ERP project team has worked countless hours to deliver a successful go-live launch of our new ERP platform in Canada early in October. Likewise, our Global Ecommerce management team has been working diligently to integrate the Pitney Bowes and Borderfree businesses while identifying and achieving cost synergies. In our Mailing business in France, we transitioned to a new sales model. And in our Software business, we continued to offer new targeted solutions for enterprise clients, including our new EngageOne Video software solution. 
Now let me take you through our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide a little more detail around our outlook for the balance of the year. As with the first half of the year, currency, again, had a meaningful impact on the comparisons of our reported results for the quarter. Additionally, as a reminder, revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the sale of Imagitas and the acquisition of Borderfree last quarter. While both of these businesses had similar revenue profiles on an annual basis, seasonally, Imagitas had its best revenue performance in the third quarter, and Borderfree has its best revenue performance in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by $34 million or 4% and our earnings per share by $0.02. Year-to-date, currency has reduced revenue by $105 million or 4% and earnings per share by $0.05. Beyond these translation effects, the strong U.S. dollar has continued to impact the volume of U.S. outbound cross-border purchases in our e-commerce business. 
Additionally, the divested revenues related to the strategic actions we took in Europe last year unfavorably impacted our revenue comparisons by approximately $4 million this quarter. While this did not have a meaningful impact on our total revenue comparison, it did impact more meaningfully the individual segments, which I will discuss shortly. This is the last quarter to be affected by these year-over-year comparisons. 
Before I review the results of the quarter in more detail, I want to remind you that the company's third quarter earnings-related documents, which include our press release, financial statements and slides can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Now turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $870 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in Europe, revenue declined 3% in SMB Solutions and was flat in Enterprise Business Solutions. Revenue grew 10% in Digital Commerce Solutions. As I mentioned at the outset of my discussion, these growth rates are all in line with the long-term market growth rates I presented at Analyst Day and are an improvement from the second quarter. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% in SMB Solutions and 3% in Enterprise Business Solutions. Reported revenue in Digital Commerce Solutions grew 6%. 
Gross margin this quarter was 58.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points from prior year, driven in part by growth in high margin mail finishing equipment in North America SMB, Production Mail and service sales globally and the addition of Borderfree revenue in our e-commerce business. 
SG&A this quarter totaled $309 million, which was a reduction of $33 million from the prior year, despite the inclusion of about $4 million of amortization of intangibles expensed for Borderfree and higher spend related to our Canada ERP go-live preparation. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved by 70 basis points, further evidence of the success of our continued focus on operational excellence. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $38 million, which was a decline of more than $4 million when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was $173 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year despite the adverse impact of currency, the loss of high margin Imagitas income and the Borderfree and ERP items I just noted. Adding back total depreciation and amortization for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $215 million.
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 32.4% compared to 16% in the prior year. As a reminder, prior year's tax rate included $16 million in tax benefits from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, the 2014 effective tax rate would have been 28.3%.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS were $0.43. Prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and included $0.08 per share of tax benefits that I just referenced. When you exclude those tax benefits, last year's adjusted EPS were also $0.43.
GAAP EPS were $0.44 and included a $0.01 per share net tax benefit primarily related to the previous divestiture of an investment and some additional acquisition and disposition-related transaction costs. Earnings per share this quarter were adversely impacted by a $0.02 per share reduction related to currency translation. As expected, earnings per share were also impacted by the loss of 3 months of Imagitas earnings, which were estimated to be approximately $0.03 per share and $0.01 per share of expense for the amortization of intangibles related to Borderfree. A reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slides.
Looking at free cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow during the quarter was $131 million, and cash provided by operating activities was $150 million on a GAAP basis. When compared to the prior year, third quarter free cash flow was higher primarily due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital expenditures from a reduced level of investment in ERP this quarter.
At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion of total debt, which was about $245 million lower than the prior year, and we had $750 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Included in total debt at the end of the quarter was $150 million in commercial paper outstanding. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $286 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.22%, which was a slight reduction of 6 basis points from the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $38 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, repurchased 4.9 million shares for $100 million and made $15 million in restructuring payments. Also, during the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100 million of share repurchase.
Turning to our business segment results. For SMB Solutions in North American mailing, revenue for the quarter was $353 million, and EBIT was $159 million. Revenue declined just 1.6% on a constant currency basis and less than 3% on a reported basis, which was the lowest rate of decline in 6 quarters. Revenue benefited from 2% growth in equipment sales as productivity continues to improve. Recurring revenue stream trends also continued to be in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.1%, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business, organizational streamlining and ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $105 million, and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined 9% on a constant currency basis and 21% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 7%, excluding currency and the divested revenues I mentioned earlier. The rate of decline in revenue is stabilizing most of the major markets where the go-to-market resource shift has been completed. We focused on transitioning the sales organization in France during the quarter, which is expected to improve productivity. EBIT margin was 10.3%, which was a decline of 190 basis points from prior year due to lower mail finishing equipment sales, the impact of currency on some costs and the temporary incremental costs of transitioning the sales organization in France.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $102 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue would have declined 4%, excluding currency and the divested revenue in Europe related to this segment. Inserting equipment sales grew versus prior year. However, there were no production print installations during the quarter, which adversely impacted revenue. Revenue also declined partly due to lower support services revenue this quarter. EBIT margin was 12.2%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to the mix of high-margin inserting equipment sales as well as ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $116 million, and EBIT was $26 million. Revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volume of First Class and Standard mail processed versus the prior year. EBIT margin was 22.4%, which was an improvement of 270 basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives.
Turning to the Digital Commerce Solutions group. For the software services segment, revenue was $98 million, and EBIT was $15 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 13% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, revenue comparisons were impacted by lower licensing revenue in the Americas when compared to the prior year, which included a large licensing deal. Excluding the impact of that deal, software results were positive and in line with expectation as the business is acquiring new enterprise clients through targeted industry and application specific solutions. EBIT margin was 15%, a decline of 190 basis points from prior year as a result of lower licensing revenue which carries a higher margin.
For the Global Ecommerce segment, revenue was $97 million, and EBIT was a loss of $1 million. Revenue grew 36% on a constant currency basis and 34% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and the continued expansion of the eBay U.K. outbound cross-border service.
Outbound package shipments from the U.S. continued to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. EBIT margin was a negative 1%, which was relatively flat to prior year despite incremental expenses, including the amortization of intangibles as well as expense and investments related to the Borderfree acquisition. These incremental expenses offset benefits from initial integration synergies during the quarter. The other segment is comprised of the Imagitas marketing services business, which was sold in May of this year.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to focus the discussion on guidance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect the improving trends experienced in the third quarter to continue and further improve in the fourth quarter as a result of the actions we've taken to achieve our long-term strategic initiatives. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We are modifying our revenue guidance for the following reasons: First, the relatively strong U.S. dollar continues to impact cross-border e-commerce purchases through our U.S.-based e-commerce business. Second, we are still working through the SMB go-to-market transition in France. We substantially transitioned the sales organization by the end of the third quarter, but there's still more to do to achieve the productivity levels we are targeting. And third, the uncertain global economic environment is impacting some capital investment decisions, which is impacting our Production Mail and software businesses. Therefore, we now expect annual revenue to be in the range of flat to a decline of 2% when compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis. 
As I noted, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year as operational excellence initiatives are expected to drive further cost reductions and efficiencies in the business. Adjusted EPS is still expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90, and GAAP EPS is still expected to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.21 for the year. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $450 million to $525 million for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

I think, as always, there's a dose of each one of the elements that you describe. If you start with the end-user market, there's no doubt that the end user market opportunity is under some level of pressures. You see particularly businesses continuing to move their production to service bureaus, and that has a short-term dynamic on the revenue. That said, I would say that longer term, we think we're uniquely positioned to provide value to those service bureaus. So while it's disruptive in the short term, it is something, I think, in the long term that will advantage us. The second point I would make is that we've been shy on printer sales this week -- this year. Printers are something that affect the top line in a fairly material way, but obviously, as you know, don't come with a lot of profit. And as we focus ourselves on driving revenue with profit, we have walked away from some of those opportunities that wouldn't make economic sense for us. So as we've always said, it's going to be a lumpy business. It was not great from a top line perspective in the third quarter. Pretty darn good from a profit perspective, and we like our hand going forward."

The supplies -- I don't want to read too much into this, but supplies looked like it improved pretty significantly in the September quarter.

It's the traditional ink products in the Mailing business, and we had very solid performance there. To Marc's comment on go-to-market, obviously a component of go-to-market is our sales activities around supplies. And we've put a real focus on that and have had good performance there. The other thing benefiting supplies is in our Production Mail business, even though we didn't have any placements of printers in the quarter, as we built an install base of printers out there, that drive supplies revenue as well. So that was a positive. And as we achieve future placements, that helps build a incremental recurring revenue stream. With respect to rentals, I would say you are seeing the stabilization, certainly, in the North American Mailing business. On the international side, that's been impacted somewhat by the go-to-market, particularly in France, which is the other key market where we see rental. So to Marc's earlier comments, as we see stabilization in those markets, and particularly in France, on a go-forward basis, that should help over time with rentals. And as you know, rentals and the other recurring revenue streams tend not to move as dramatically quarter-to-quarter because of an installed base than, say, the equipment sales line might."

We tend to have it in France, but not in most of the other markets. That's number one.

So again, I think if you look at that business over the last couple of years, they've done that high single digits -- actually, low double-digit performance, so it's not even quarter-to-quarter.

So again, I think if you look at that business over the last couple of years, they've done that high single digits -- actually, low double-digit performance, so it's not even quarter-to-quarter. Software businesses are never even quarter-to-quarter, particularly the ones that are starting with the level of scale that we have. The next move for them is to kind of think where we started. We went from general to product specialists. The next turn of the crank is to go from product specialist to solution sales. So let me give you an example of what that means. So we have our customer information management businesses. That's a line of business. It's a product specialty, if you will. As they mature their channel, they'll move from product specialists that know those products inside and out to people that know about money laundering and know your customer and other types of application areas that become important to the client. So I can get the predicate of your question looking at the third quarter results. I would say that they've hit the ball fairly consistent with what we think our long-term expectations are over the last couple of years. And they got more opportunities for productivity. The other thing that, that will help, and we haven't talked about it a lot, is we've not done as well this year on our services business in software as we had planned. As you move more into the solutions aspect, it will drag your services business along with it."

As I mentioned, from a quarterly perspective, there were some positive and negatives. That's not to be unexpected. That's generally the way. As we pointed to at Analyst Day, we expected the third quarter to be better than the first half and the fourth quarter to be further improvement from there, and I think that's the way it's going to turn out. 
In terms of our strategic road map, and I think this is the headline of the third quarter, we made little progress over the last 90 days. And I would just recap, too, because I think their economic consequence is so substantial, the fact that we got Canada out the door from a systems perspective is significant. As we've talked about, that's the next important step to realizing that $125 million of benefit. I would say we've seen productivity improvements beyond what I would have expected where we are in deployment already. And the second really important strategic item that we're able to make progress on in the third quarter, to Shannon's question, was the integration of Borderfree. We've talked about $25 million to $30 million of synergies over the next 18 months. Collectively, those 2 items represent $150 million benefit. So as I said, you'll get fluctuations and a little bit noise quarter-to-quarter, but our focus and our perspective is squarely on the long-term creation of shareholder value. 
That will conclude our remarks for today. We'll talk to you in 90 days."
