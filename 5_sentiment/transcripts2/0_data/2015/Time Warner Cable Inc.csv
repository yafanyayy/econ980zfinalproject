Fourth quarter revenue grew to 3.8% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 5.6% were the best of the year. And our focus on residential subscriber growth was evident in our standouts sub numbers across all categories. 
In particular, residential customer relationship net adds of 54,000 were the best in any fourth quarter since we went public. And residential Triple Play net ads of 273,000 were the most in any fourth quarter ever. It was just about a year ago that we laid out our 3-year operating and strategic plan for Time Warner Cable. As a core element of that plan, we set out to revitalize our residential business by refocusing on growing our customer base, investing in reliability and customer service and enhancing our product set. Also key to the plan, we committed to drive continued growth in Business Services by expanding our network, augmenting our salesforce and increasing productivity. Even with our February agreement to merge with Comcast and all of the associated distractions, our key must stay 100% committed to the plan. The results show, and I couldn't be prouder of what we've been able to accomplish this past year. 
Our efforts put us ahead of plan in almost every operational category. For the full year 2014, we added 150,000 residential customer relationships and 373,000 Triple Plays, a radical turnaround from the past several years. Not only are we ahead of plan from our subscriber perspective, but we're also ahead of schedule on many of our customer experience focused initiatives. We completed our TWC Maxx speed increases in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, and our All Digital conversion is done in New York City and L.A., and in process in Austin. These investments, along with investments we've made in new set-top boxes and modems, WiFi Hotspots and better reliability and customer service are already having an impact on customer satisfaction. And critically, customers in TWC Maxx markets with our new modems have churn rates that are materially lower than customers in non-Maxx markets. It's still early days, but those are exactly the proof points we banked on. Needless to say, we're very enthusiastic about launching Maxx in 7 additional markets this year. 
We're also ahead of schedule in key customer service metrics. In Q4, our techs arrived within our industry-leading 1 hour appointment windows, an astounding 97% of the time. And rework is down to historically low levels, meaning we are doing it better -- doing better at resolving customer's issues the first time. We're ahead of plan and invest in our plan and CPE reliability too. Our planned health metrics were great. But more important from our customers perspective, is the trouble calls per customer relationship were 18% lower in December than a year earlier. And we continued to deliver even better products. We'll complete the expansion of VOD capacity to 75,000 hours next quarter. That's more than a fivefold increase in just a couple of years. 
Our TWC TV app keeps getting better with more linear networks and VOD choices available on more devices both inside and outside the home. 
In Q4, we saw usage of TWC TV continue to grow. In December, almost 1 million video subscribers used the app. We added unlimited China and Hong Kong calling to our phone service, which already included unlimited calling throughout North America. And we've expanded public WiFi dramatically, so our customers can enjoy the benefits of broadband in more places. 
December WiFi sections topped $28 million, up more than 30% over the end of Q3. As I mentioned, Business Services growth is critical to our operating plan. Business Services revenue grew nearly 23% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. And Business Services OIBDA margin continues to expand. 
Our Business Services strategy is working and we're right on track to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2018. Our sales team also stepped up in 2014, making the most of the opportunity created by the midterm elections. We generated $113 million of political advertising revenue, essentially matching our record of 2012 performance. And contributing to full year ad revenue growth of more than 10%. 
So we accomplished an awful lot in 2014. While we were slightly shy of our 2014 financial objectives, I'd argue that we overdelivered operationally. As a result of our really outstanding sub performance, we entered 2015 with a healthier, bigger customer base than we had planned and terrific subscriber momentum. And as a result of our investments in our plan, our equipment our products, in our care and tech ops capabilities, we are very well-positioned for the future. 
Of course, we continue to work with Comcast and Charter to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to close our merger as well as the plan for integration of our companies. The deal will be great for our customers and our shareholders. And we look forward to closing soon. In the meantime, we are committed to executing on our plan and building on 2014's operating momentum. 
With that as an overview, let me ask Artie to briefly cover our key takeaways for our fourth quarter results. Artie?"

Before I get going, I'd like to hit a couple of housekeeping items that are probably pretty obvious but worth mentioning anyway. As Rob mentioned, we continue to expect the closing of our merger with Comcast will occur early this year. As a result, we're not going to be providing full year guidance today, nor are we announcing an increase to our regular dividend. Those are both things we typically do on our Q4 call but not appropriate today, given where we stand in the deal process. 
I'm going to start today by rewinding the clock to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. As you will recall, we spent a good bit of time walking through our 3-year operating and financial plan to revitalize TWC. As Rob indicated in his opening remarks, we are running ahead of that plan operationally. Our residential subscriber metrics are better-than-expected, our customer care and tech ops performance is the best in recent memory. Our TWC Maxx rollout is accelerating and Business Services continues to be a strong driver of growth. 
On the financial side, I'm also pleased with our performance. And with the go forward for financial trajectory of the business, albeit, off a modestly lower 2014 base. 
With that, let me turn to the Q4 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we performed very well. On the residential side, we gained 54,000 customer relationships in Q4. In Business Services, we added 13,000 CRs. So on a combined basis we had the best results for a Q4 at least since the time of the Adelphia transaction in 2006. The Q4 residential CR performance was driven by a 7% increase in connects, coupled with a 7% improvement in disconnects. You might recall that back in 2013, we moved to dedicated retention centers. This approach continues to pay dividends as we saw continued improvements in churn reduction. And on the connect front, we saw improvements across all major sales channels. Particularly inbound sales, online and direct sales. 
Our fourth quarter subscriber results topped off a strong year. Full year Residential CR net adds of 150,000 were 440,000 better than last year, and 0.25 million better than in 2012. You will recall that a major driver of our operating financial plan was to add 1 million residential CRs between 2014 and 2016, so that we could get back to a more balanced residential revenue growth from a volume and rate. 
Our 2014 Residential CR performance exceeded our expectations and we entered 2015 with strong momentum. PSU performance in Q4 also was outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 425,000 were 600,000 better than last year's Q4 and 445,000 better than in 2012. All geographic markets performed better than in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2013. The PSU growth was driven by CR increases as well as particularly strong Triple Play net adds, with Triple Play connects more than doubling over last year. At year-end, residential triples increased to 30% of the base. Triples now represent 46% of monthly recurring revenue which is up approximately 300 basis points from a year ago. 
On an individual product basis, residential video net declines of 38,000 were the best Q4 since 2006, 179,000 better than last year and 91,000 better than 2012. We saw an improvement in video performance as we went through the quarter. And in December, we had positive video net adds. 
Broadband volume also was very strong. Residential net adds of 168,000 were the best for a fourth quarter in 7 years, and were in fact higher than the net adds in all of 2013. Phone net adds of 295,000 were the strongest in a fourth quarter ever. As we've completed our migration of our phone product to our internal platform, we are able to much more cost effectively offer phone as a value-added product to our customers. This has helped us drive Triple Play sell-in, and we also continue to benefit from product rollouts in phone such as free calling to Mexico, Hong Kong and China. 
With that, let's move onto our Q4 financial results. Total revenue of $5.8 billion was up 3.8% year-over-year. Residential Services revenue grew $21 million or 0.5% year-over-year driven by a 7.4% increase in broadband revenue. Consistent with our residential 3-year plan, more of the revenue growth came from volume than from rate. 
In Business Services, revenue increased $139 million or 22.6% year-over-year in Q4. The core business here continues to be very, very healthy. In fact, if you exclude the slow-growing video product, revenue growth for the remaining products in the segment data, voice and transport was almost 26%. Operating leverage continues to be a big part of the story here. Sales were up, productivity continue to improve in Q4 and we continue to manage cost aggressively. As a result, Business Services' adjusted OIBDA margin increased by approximately 180 basis points to about 62%. 
Other operations revenue grew 16.1% in Q4. Media sales revenue was really strong, increasing more than 19% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in political advertising revenue which was $61 million in the quarter versus $7 million in last year's Q4. Excluding political, ad revenue was flat year-over-year. And while full year 2014 advertising revenue of $1.1 billion was an all-time record, it did include $113 million of political revenue, making 2015 a difficult comparison. 
Fourth quarter other revenue increased primarily due to affiliate fees from our Residential Services segment as well as other distributors for carriage of the Lakers RSNs. 
We grew total company adjusted OIBDA 5.6% in Q4. This reflects the strongest organic growth we've seen in recent years. While the adjusted OIBDA growth was strong, it was a little bit light from what we have been projecting for our adjusted OIBDA at the end of Q3. Nothing really noteworthy here, other than other there were frankly, a few good guys we have been forecasting on the expense side that didn't materialize and there are a few expense bad guys around in churns, accruals and legal settlements that we had not forecasted that negatively impact us. 
Programming cost for residential sub, including an intercompany charge for market-rate RSN deals increased 12.5% to a little over $39. Keep in mind that the launches of new network such as the SEC network last summer somewhat skewed the year-over-year programming cost comparison. These new launches will obviously impact 2015 programming cost growth as well. 
Tech ops and customer care together increased $42 million or 7.5%. The investments we're making in these areas have been instrumental in building a better customer experience. Higher sales expense in the quarter was more than offset by lower marketing costs particularly in the areas of broadcast and production costs as we have strategically reallocated our marketing investments to sales channels such as inbound sales and direct sales reps. 
Moving down the income statement, fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was very strong at $2.03, up 11.5%. And for the year, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14.4% to $7.56. I would remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, share count production now has a smaller impact on EPS growth. In fact, not much at all in Q4. Free cash flow was 890 -- $891 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, free cash flow of $2.3 billion was down 9.9% from 2013, primarily due to higher capital expenditures. CapEx of $4.1 billion in 2014 increased by almost $900 million from 2013. Reflecting improvements to the plant, our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops and DTAs and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable setups across the footprint. 
We also continue to invest in the future growth of Business Services, we connected nearly 70,000 buildings to our network in 2014, bringing the total number of connected buildings to 930,000. 
So net-net, I am very pleased with our continued momentum. And until we close, we will run as hard as we can to the finish line, and made good on our promise to deliver the company to Comcast in very good shape. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

A couple things I would just point out in ARPU. One, is as we move to a new offer in Q4 that had a free installation, if you combine sort of the free installation impact and as well as lower pay-per-view events, what we would sort of call nonrecurring ARPU. That had those had an impact and actually what we sort of refer to as monthly recurring ARPU, that was actually up slightly. The other item I would just sort of point out when you think about ARPU, you'll recall when that this year, in '14, was the first year we moved to what we call unified rate strategy. Meaning that no matter what sort of bundle you're in, whether you're Double Play, Triple Play, you receive 1 rate increase a year. That's different and causes comparisons to '13 when we were sort of doing more product rate increases meaning if you're a double or triple you could actually get multiple rate increases through out the year. So that obviously, has as queuing impact on ARPU growth. What I would point out to you is, we're basically, getting right into in '15, the rollout of our '15 rate increases so should expect a step up in ARPU from rates and fees that we will be implementing. You get partial quarter impact of that in Q1 in a full quarter impact in Q2."

I think Sling TV is a variation on that theme with only 12, I believe, 12 networks, select networks from I think 3 providers or 4 providers for a relatively low price. I think it's intriguing in the sense that it reflects a willingness of programmers to deviate from the big bundle packages that we've generally offered. In terms of the attractiveness of Sling TV itself, I'm a little bit skeptical in that I think we've got a more compelling light, if you will, bundle that happens to be called our starter video product, Basic cable for about the same price but with many more highly rated networks. So I think we'll watch and were certainly interested in more flexible packages but I'm not sure that that's the right one. In terms of net neutrality, I'd rather answer your question not in terms of what if the Comcast deal doesn't close, because we remain confident that it will, but I'll talk generally about net neutrality. I think, at this point, I don't have any greater knowledge of exactly what's going to come out of the FCC than you probably do. If we read Chairman Willis' recent statements, it appears that they're going down a Title 2 with forbearance path, but the exact contours of that, I think, remains to be seen. And the impact of that anything they come up with will have on our future investment or willingness to invest I think we'll impart depend on the details. I think it's -- it almost goes without saying that to the extent what they proper creates uncertainty around the regulatory regime, in which we will be operating that is likely to chill our enthusiasm for investment. But they have a general statement, it's hard to see more."

And to date, we've use that as of value added to our high-speed data product. But I think that's really just the beginning in the idea of utilizing WiFi as a component of a voice offering is pretty intriguing. So I assume what you're referring to is the announcement that Cablevision made earlier this week and it's pretty intriguing to us. We actually implemented a somewhat similar strategy when we had our MVNO arrangement with Clearwire in that we offered a small bundle of data, it wasn't a voice product but it was a WiFi-first date offering with an MVNO cellular backup. And in theory, as the technology for voice over WiFi continues to improve, it's theoretically kind of interesting to think about a variation on what Cablevision is doing. So were going to watch that as he would uptick is I'm not sure that they struck exactly the right chord in terms of the match between price and the absence of the cellular backup.

The reason I don't think Title II has much of an impact is that, today, the types of rules that are being talked about to ensure an open Internet are wholly consistent with our behaviors and wholly consistent with the rest of the ISP industry's behaviors. So I don't think anything's going to change on that front. And usage-based pricing doesn't seem to be a target of any regulations at this point.

So I noticed there's a decent overlap between the markets that you've announced for Maxx and pending Google Fiber markets. And I'm just wondering how sort of Google moving into fibers or impacting your decision on markets that you roll out. But also, it impacts the sort of sense of urgency you have around rolling out a voice, a WiFi-first voice offering, given that Google seems to be moving in that direction as well. The second question quickly just on SEC goes ahead and redefines broadband off 25 megabits per second, how do you think that impacts the calculus of the DOJ on the DO, if at all? Let me start with your last question. I think that the notion of defining broadband at 25 megabits per second is somewhat arbitrary. I'm not really sure what that is intended to mean. And really, I don't anticipate that, that has any practical implications for life going forward or for the DOJ's analysis of the deal. In terms of Maxx, as we said, when we first articulated our 3-year plan, our aim is to have 75% of our footprint enabled with Maxx attributes by the end of the 3-year plan period. So and my guess is we'll continue to roll it out beyond that. But so the only question is prioritization. And obviously, as we think about where to go first, competitive dynamics are a factor. So that includes Google, although it's not explicitly dictated by where Google decides to go. In fact, I think, we announced the before Google did the announcement this week. So competitive certainly relevant obviously. In terms of urgency around the WiFi first offering, As I said earlier I think WiFi first is an interest -- as a -- WiFi first voice product is interesting, but we don't have any specific launch plans at this time.

Q4 marked a strong finish to a really positive year for Time Warner Cable. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 3.8% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 5.6% were the best of the year, and our focus on residential subscriber growth was evident in our standout sub numbers across all categories. In particular, residential customer relationship net adds of 54,000 were the best in any fourth quarter since we went public, and residential triple play net adds of 273,000 were the most in any fourth quarter ever.
It was just about a year ago that we laid out our 3-year operating and strategic plan for Time Warner Cable. As a core element of that plan, we set out to revitalize our residential business by refocusing on growing our customer base, investing in reliability and customer service and enhancing our product set. Also key to the plan, we committed to drive continued growth in business services by expanding our network, augmenting our sales force and increasing productivity. Even with our February agreement to merge with Comcast and all of the associated distractions, our teams has stayed 100% committed to the plan. The results show, and I couldn't be prouder of what we've been able to accomplish this past year. Our efforts put us ahead of the plan in almost every operational category. For the full year 2014, we added 150,000 residential customer relationships and 373,000 triple plays, a radical turnaround from the past several years.
Not only are we ahead of plan from a subscriber perspective, but we're also ahead of schedule on many of our customer-experience-focused initiatives. We completed our TWC Maxx speed increases in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, and our all digital conversion is done in New York City and L.A. and in process in Austin. These investments, along with investments we've made in new set-top boxes and modems, WiFi Hotspots and better reliability and customer service, are already having an impact on customer satisfaction. And critically, customers in TWC Maxx markets with our new modems have churn rates that are materially lower than customers in non-Maxx markets. It's still early days, but those are exactly the proof points we banked on. Needless to say, we're very enthusiastic about launching Maxx in 7 additional markets this year.
We're also ahead of schedule in key customer service metrics. In Q4, our techs arrived within our industry-leading, 1-hour appointment windows an astounding 97% of the time, and rework is down to historically low levels, meaning we are doing it better -- doing better at resolving customers' issues the first time. We're ahead of plan and investing in our plant and CPE reliability, too. Our planned health metrics look great, but more important, from a customer's perspective, is that trouble calls per customer relationship were 18% lower in December than a year earlier.
And we continued to deliver even better products. We'll complete the expansion of VOD capacity to 75,000 hours next quarter. That's more than a fivefold increase in just a couple of years. Our TWC TV App keeps getting better with more linear networks and VOD choices available on more devices both inside and outside the home. In Q4, we saw usage of TWC TV continue to grow. In December, almost 1 million video subscribers used the app. We added unlimited China and Hong Kong calling to our phone service, which already included unlimited calling throughout North America. And we've expanded public WiFi dramatically so our customers can enjoy the benefits of broadband in more places. December WiFi sections topped $28 million, up more than 30% over the end of Q3.
As I mentioned, business services growth is critical to our operating plan. Business services revenue grew nearly 23% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, and business services OIBDA margin continues to expand. Our business services strategy is working, and we're right on track to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2018. Our ad sales team also stepped up in 2014, making the most of the opportunity created by the midterm elections. We generated $113 million of political advertising revenue, essentially matching our record of 2012 performance and contributing to full year ad revenue growth of more than 10%.
So we accomplished an awful lot in 2014. While we were slightly shy of our 2014 financial objectives, I'd argue that we overdelivered operationally. As a result of our really outstanding sub performance, we entered 2015 with a healthier, bigger customer base than we had planned and terrific subscriber momentum. And as a result of our investment in our plant, our equipment, our products, and our care and tech ops capabilities, we are very well positioned for the future.
Of course, we continue to work with Comcast and Charter to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to close our merger as well as the plan for the integration of our companies. The deal will be great for our customers and our shareholders, and we look forward to closing soon. In the meantime, we are committed to executing on our plan and building on 2014's operating momentum.
With that as an overview, let me ask Artie to briefly cover the key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. Artie?"

Before I get going, I'd like to hit a couple of housekeeping items that are probably pretty obvious but worth mentioning anyway. As Rob mentioned, we continue to expect the closing of our merger with Comcast will occur early this year. As a result, we're not going to be providing full year guidance today nor are we announcing an increase to our regular dividend. Those are both things we typically do on our Q4 call but not appropriate today given where we stand in the deal process.
I'm going to start today by rewinding the clock to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. As you will recall, we spent a good bit of time walking through our 3-year operating and financial plan to revitalize TWC. As Rob indicated in his opening remarks, we are running ahead of that plan operationally. Our residential subscriber metrics are better than expected. Our customer care and tech ops performance is the best in recent memory. Our TWC Maxx rollout is accelerating, and business services continues to be a strong driver of growth. On the financial side, I'm also pleased with our performance and with the go-forward for the financial trajectory of the business albeit of a modestly lower 2014 base.
With that, let me turn to the Q4 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we performed very well. On the residential side, we gained 54,000 customer relationships in Q4. In business services, we added 13,000 CRs. So on a combined basis, we had the best results for a Q4 at least since the time of the Adelphia transaction in 2006. The Q4 residential CR performance was driven by a 7% increase in connects, coupled with a 7% improvement in disconnects. You might recall that back in 2013, we moved to dedicated retention centers. This approach continues to pay dividends as we saw continued improvements in churn reduction. And on the connect front, we saw improvements across all major sales channels, particularly inbound sales, online and direct sales.
Our fourth quarter subscriber results topped off a strong year. Full year residential CR net adds of 150,000 were 440,000 better than last year and 0.25 million better than in 2012. You will recall that a major driver of our operating financial plan was to add 1 million residential CRs between 2014 and 2016 so that we could get back to a more balanced residential revenue growth from volume and rate. Our 2014 residential CR performance exceeded our expectations, and we entered 2015 with strong momentum.
PSU performance in Q4 also was outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 425,000 were 600,000 better than last year's Q4 and 445,000 better than in 2012. All geographic markets performed better than in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2013. The PSU growth was driven by CR increases as well as particularly strong triple play net adds, with triple play connects more than doubling over last year. At year-end, residential triples increased to 30% of the base. Triples now represent 46% of monthly recurring revenue, which is up approximately 300 basis points from a year ago.
On an individual product basis, residential video net declines of 38,000 were the best Q4 since 2006, 179,000 better than last year and 91,000 better than 2012. We saw an improvement in video performance as we went through the quarter, and in December, we had positive video net adds. Broadband volume also was very strong. Residential net adds of 168,000 were the best for a fourth quarter in 7 years and were, in fact, higher than the net adds in all of 2013. Phone net adds of 295,000 were the strongest in a fourth quarter ever. As we have completed our migration of our phone product to our internal platform, we are able to much more cost effectively offer phone as a value-added product to our customers. This has helped us drive triple play sell-in, and we also continue to benefit from product rollouts in phone, such as free calling to Mexico, Hong Kong and China.
With that, let's move on to our Q4 financial results. Total revenue of $5.8 billion was up 3.8% year-over-year. Residential services revenue grew $21 million or 0.5% year-over-year, driven by a 7.4% increase in broadband revenue. Consistent with our residential 3-year plan, more of the revenue growth came from volume than from rate.
In business services, revenue increased $139 million or 22.6% year-over-year in Q4. The core business here continues to be very, very healthy. In fact, if you exclude the slow-growing video product, revenue growth for the remaining products in the segment, data, voice and transport, was almost 26%. Operating leverage continues to be a big part of the story here. Sales rep productivity continued to improve in Q4, and we continued to manage cost aggressively. As a result, business services adjusted OIBDA margin increased by approximately 180 basis points to about 62%.
Other operations revenue grew 16.1% in Q4. Media sales revenue was really strong, increasing more than 19% year-over-year primarily due to growth in political advertising revenue, which was $61 million in the quarter versus $7 million in last year's Q4. Excluding political, ad revenue was flat year-over-year. And while full year 2014 advertising revenue of $1.1 billion was an all-time record, it did include $113 million of political revenue, making 2015 a difficult comparison. Fourth quarter other revenue increased primarily due to affiliate fees from our residential services segment as well as other distributors for carriage of the Lakers RSNs.
We grew total company adjusted OIBDA 5.6% in Q4. This reflects the strongest organic growth we've seen in recent years. While the adjusted OIBDA growth was strong, it was a little bit light from what we had been projecting for adjusted OIBDA at the end of Q3, nothing really noteworthy here other than there were, frankly, a few good guys we had been forecasting on the expense side that didn't materialize and there are a few expense bad guys around insurance accruals and legal settlements that we had not forecasted that negatively impact us.
Programming cost for residential sub, including an intercompany charge for market-rate RSN deals, increased 12.5% to a little over $39. Keep in mind that the launches of new networks, such as the SEC Network last summer, somewhat skewed the year-over-year programming cost comparison. These new launches will, obviously, impact 2015 programming cost growth as well.
Tech ops and customer care together increased $42 million or 7.5%. The investments we're making in these areas have been instrumental in building a better customer experience. Higher sales expense in the quarter was more than offset by lower marketing cost particularly in the areas of broadcast and production cost as we have strategically reallocated our marketing investment to sales channels, such as inbound sales and direct sales reps.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was very strong at $2.03, up 11.5%. And for the year, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14.4% to $7.56. I would remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, share count reduction now has a smaller impact on EPS growth, in fact, not much at all in Q4.
Free cash flow was $891 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, free cash flow of $2.3 billion was down 9.9% from 2013, primarily due to higher capital expenditures.
CapEx of $4.1 billion in 2014 increased by almost $900 million from 2013, reflecting improvements to the plant, our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable set-tops across the footprint.
We also continue to invest in the future growth of business services. We connected nearly 70,000 buildings to our network in 2014, bringing the total number of connected buildings to 930,000.
So net-net, I am very pleased with our continued momentum, and until we close, we will run as hard as we can to the finish line and make good on our promise to deliver the company to Comcast in very good shape.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

One is as we move to a new offer in Q4 that had a free installation, if you combine sort of the free installation impact and -- as well as lower pay-per-view events, what we would sort of call nonrecurring ARPU, that had -- those had an impact. And actually, what we sort of refer to as monthly recurring ARPU, that was actually up slightly. The other item I would just sort of point out when you think about ARPU, you'll recall when -- that this year, in '14, was the first year we moved to what we call unified rate strategy, meaning that no matter what sort of bundle you are in, whether you're double play, triple play, you receive one rate increase a year. That's different and causes comparisons to '13 when we were sort of doing more product rate increases, meaning if you're a double or a triple, you could actually get multiple rate increases through out the year. So that, obviously, has a skewing impact on ARPU growth. What I would point out to you is, we're basically getting right into, in '15, the rollout of our '15 rate increases. So you should expect a step-up in ARPU from rates and fees that we will be implementing. You'll get a partial quarter impact of that in Q1 and a full quarter impact in Q2."

Sure. First, Laura, on Sling TV, we've been advocates of flexible video packages for quite some time. I think Sling TV is a variation on that theme with only 12 -- I believe, 12 networks, select networks from, I think, 3 providers or 4 providers for a relatively low price. I think it's intriguing in the sense that it reflects a willingness of programmers to deviate from the big bundle packages that we've generally offered. In terms of the attractiveness of Sling TV itself, I'm a little bit skeptical in that I think we've got a more compelling light, if you will, bundle that happens to be called our Starter video product, Basic cable, for about the same price but with many more highly rated networks. So I think we'll watch. And we're certainly interested in more flexible packages, but I'm not sure that that's the right one. In terms of net neutrality, I'd rather answer your question not in terms of what if the Comcast deal doesn't close because we remain confident that it will, but I'll talk generally about net neutrality. I think, at this point, I don't have any greater knowledge of exactly what's going to come out of the FCC than you probably do. If we read Chairman Wheeler's recent statements, it appears that they're going down in Title II with forbearance path, but the exact contours of that, I think, remains to be seen. And the impact that anything they come up with will have on our future investment or willingness to invest, I think, will, in part, depend on the details. I think it's -- it almost goes without saying that to the extent what they proffer creates uncertainty around the regulatory regime in which we will be operating, that is likely to chill our enthusiasm for investment. But beyond that general statement, it's hard to say more."

But I think that's really just the beginning, and the idea of utilizing WiFi as a component of a voice offering is pretty intriguing. So I assume what you're referring to is the announcement that Cablevision made earlier this week, and it's pretty intriguing to us. We actually implemented a somewhat similar strategy when we had our MVNO arrangement with Clearwire in that we offered a small bundle of data. It wasn't a voice product, but it was a WiFi-first data offering with an MVNO cellular backup. And in theory, as the technology for voice over WiFi continues to improve, it's theoretically, kind of, interesting to think about a variation on what Cablevision is doing. So we're going to watch that, see what the uptake is. I'm not sure that they struck exactly the right chord in terms of the match between price and the absence of a cellular backup, but I think it's pretty cool."

So I don't think anything is going to change on that front, and usage-based pricing doesn't seem to be a target of any regulations at this point.

So I noticed there's a decent overlap between the new markets that you've announced for Maxx and pending Google Fiber markets, and I'm just wondering how, sort of, Google moving into fiber is sort of impacting your decision on markets that you roll out but also how it impacts the -- sort of the sense of urgency you have around rolling out a voice -- a WiFi-first voice offering given that Google seems to be moving in that direction as well.

I'm not really sure what that is intended to mean, and really, I don't anticipate that, that has any practical implications for life going forward or for the DOJ's analysis of the deal. In terms of Maxx, as we said, when we first articulated our 3-year plan, our aim is to have 75% of our footprint enabled with Maxx attributes by the end of the 3-year plan period. So -- and my guess is we'll continue to roll it out beyond that, but -- so the only question is prioritization. And obviously, as we think about where to go first, competitive dynamics are a factor. So that includes Google, although it's not explicitly dictated by where Google decides to go. In fact, I think we announced the Carolinas before Google did their announcement this week. So competitive set is certainly relevant, obviously. In terms of urgency around the WiFi-first offering, as I said earlier, I think WiFi-first is an interest as a voice -- WiFi-first voice product is interesting, but we don't have any specific launch plans at this time. So it's something we'll continue to think about."

Q4 marked a strong finish to a really positive year for Time Warner Cable. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 3.8% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 5.6% were the best of the year, and our focus on residential subscriber",875,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Q4 marked a strong finish to a really positive year for Time Warner Cable. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 3.8% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 5.6% were the best of the year, and our focus on residential subscriber growth was evident in our standout sub numbers across all categories. In particular, residential customer relationship net adds of 54,000 were the best in any fourth quarter since we went public, and residential triple play net adds of 273,000 were the most in any fourth quarter ever.
It was just about a year ago that we laid out our 3-year operating and strategic plan for Time Warner Cable. As a core element of that plan, we set out to revitalize our residential business by refocusing on growing our customer base, investing in reliability and customer service and enhancing our product set. Also key to the plan, we committed to drive continued growth in business services by expanding our network, augmenting our sales force and increasing productivity. Even with our February agreement to merge with Comcast and all of the associated distractions, our team has stayed 100% committed to the plan, the results show, and I couldn't be prouder of what we've been able to accomplish this past year. Our efforts put us ahead of plan in almost every operational category. For the full year 2014, we added 150,000 residential customer relationships and 373,000 triple plays, a radical turnaround from the past several years.
Not only are we ahead of plan from a subscriber perspective, but we're also ahead of schedule on many of our customer-experience-focused initiatives. We completed our TWC Maxx speed increases in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, and our all digital conversion is done in New York City and L.A. and in process in Austin. These investments, along with investments we've made in new set-top boxes and modems, WiFi Hotspots and better reliability and customer service, are already having an impact on customer satisfaction. And critically, customers in TWC Maxx markets with our new modems have churn rates that are materially lower than customers in non-Maxx markets. It's still early days, but those are exactly the proof points we banked on. Needless to say, we're very enthusiastic about launching Maxx in 7 additional markets this year.
We're also ahead of schedule in key customer service metrics. In Q4, our techs arrived within our industry-leading 1-hour appointment windows an astounding 97% of the time, and rework is down to historically low levels, meaning we are doing it better -- doing better at resolving customers' issues the first time. We're ahead of plan in investing in our plant and CPE reliability, too. Our planned health metrics look great, but more important, from our customers' perspective, is that trouble calls per customer relationship were 18% lower in December than a year earlier.
And we continue to deliver even better products. We'll complete the expansion of VOD capacity to 75,000 hours next quarter. That's more than a fivefold increase in just a couple of years. Our TWC TV App keeps getting better, with more linear networks and VOD choices available on more devices both inside and outside the home. In Q4, we saw usage of TWC TV continue to grow. In December, almost 1 million video subscribers used the app. We added unlimited China and Hong Kong calling to our phone service, which already included unlimited calling throughout North America. And we've expanded public WiFi dramatically, so our customers can enjoy the benefits of broadband in more places. December WiFi sessions topped 28 million, up more than 30% over the end of Q3.
As I mentioned, business services growth is critical to our operating plan. Business services revenue grew nearly 23% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, and business services OIBDA margin continues to expand. Our business services strategy is working, and we're right on track to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2018. Our ad sales team also stepped up in 2014, making the most of the opportunity created by the midterm elections. We generated $113 million of political advertising revenue, essentially matching our record of 2012 performance and contributing to full year ad revenue growth of more than 10%.
So we accomplished an awful lot in 2014. While we were slightly shy of our 2014 financial objectives, I'd argue that we overdelivered operationally. As a result of our really outstanding sub performance, we entered 2015 with a healthier, bigger customer base than we had planned and terrific subscriber momentum. And as a result of our investment in our plant, our equipment, our products, and our care and tech ops capabilities, we are very well positioned for the future.
Of course, we continue to work with Comcast and Charter to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to close our merger as well as to plan for the integration of our companies. The deal will be great for our customers and our shareholders, and we look forward to closing soon. In the meantime, we are committed to executing on our plan and building on 2014's operating momentum.
With that as an overview, let me ask Artie to briefly cover the key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. Artie?"

Before I get going, I'd like to hit a couple of housekeeping items that are probably pretty obvious, but worth mentioning anyway. As Rob mentioned, we continue to expect the closing of our merger with Comcast will occur early this year. As a result, we're not going to be providing full year guidance today nor are we announcing an increase to our regular dividend. Those are both things we typically do on our Q4 call, but not appropriate today given where we stand in the deal process.
I'm going to start today by rewinding the clock to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. As you will recall, we spent a good bit of time walking through our 3-year operating and financial plan to revitalize TWC. As Rob indicated in his opening remarks, we are running ahead of that plan operationally. Our residential subscriber metrics are better than expected. Our customer care and tech ops performance is the best in recent memory. Our TWC Maxx rollout is accelerating, and business services continues to be a strong driver of growth. On the financial side, I'm also pleased with our performance and with the go-forward for financial trajectory of the business, albeit off a modestly lower 2014 base.
With that, let me turn to the Q4 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we performed very well. On the residential side, we gained 54,000 customer relationships in Q4. In business services, we added 13,000 CRs. So on a combined basis, we had the best results for a Q4 at least since the time of the Adelphia transaction in 2006. The Q4 residential CR performance was driven by a 7% increase in connects, coupled with a 7% improvement in disconnects. You might recall that back in 2013, we moved to dedicated retention centers. This approach continues to pay dividends as we saw continued improvements in churn reduction. And on the connect front, we saw improvements across all major sales channels, particularly inbound sales, online and direct sales.
Our fourth quarter subscriber results topped off a strong year. Full year residential CR net adds of 150,000 were 440,000 better than last year and 0.25 million better than in 2012. You will recall that a major driver of our operating financial plan was to add 1 million residential CRs between 2014 and 2016 so that we could get back to more balanced residential revenue growth from volume and rate. Our 2014 residential CR performance exceeded our expectations, and we entered 2015 with strong momentum.
PSU performance in Q4 also was outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 425,000 were 600,000 better than last year's Q4 and 445,000 better than in 2012. All geographic markets performed better than in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2013. The PSU growth was driven by CR increases as well as particularly strong triple play net adds, with triple play connects more than doubling over the last year. At year-end, residential triples increased to 30% of the base. Triples now represent 46% of monthly recurring revenue, which is up approximately 300 basis points from a year ago.
On an individual product basis, residential video net declines of 38,000 were the best Q4 since 2006, 179,000 better than last year and 91,000 better than 2012. We saw an improvement in video performance as we went through the quarter, and in December, we had positive video net adds. Broadband volume also was very strong. Residential net adds of 168,000 were the best for a fourth quarter in 7 years and were, in fact, higher than the net adds in all of 2013. Phone net adds of 295,000 were the strongest in a fourth quarter ever. As we have completed our migration of our phone product to our internal platform, we are able to much more cost effectively offer phone as a value-added product to our customers. This has helped us drive triple play sell-in, and we also continue to benefit from product rollouts in phone, such as free calling to Mexico, Hong Kong and China.
With that, let's move on to our Q4 financial results. Total revenue of $5.8 billion was up 3.8% year-over-year. Residential services revenue grew $21 million or 0.5% year-over-year, driven by a 7.4% increase in broadband revenue. Consistent with our residential 3-year plan, more of the revenue growth came from volume than from rate.
In business services, revenue increased $139 million or 22.6% year-over-year in Q4. The core business here continues to be very, very healthy. In fact, if you exclude the slow-growing video product, revenue growth for the remaining products in the segment, data, voice and transport, was almost 26%. Operating leverage continues to be a big part of the story here. Sales rep productivity continued to improve in Q4, and we continued to manage costs aggressively. As a result, business services adjusted OIBDA margin increased by approximately 180 basis points to about 62%.
Other operations revenue grew 16.1% in Q4. Media sales revenue was really strong, increasing more than 19% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in political advertising revenue, which was $61 million in the quarter versus $7 million in last year's Q4. Excluding political, ad revenue was flat year-over-year. And while full year 2014 advertising revenue of $1.1 billion was an all-time record, it did include $113 million of political revenue, making 2015 a difficult comparison. Fourth quarter other revenue increased primarily due to affiliate fees from our residential services segment as well as other distributors for carriage of the Lakers RSNs.
We grew total company adjusted OIBDA 5.6% in Q4. This reflects the strongest organic growth we've seen in recent years. While the adjusted OIBDA growth was strong, it was a little bit light from what we had been projecting for adjusted OIBDA at the end of Q3. Nothing really noteworthy here other than there were, frankly, a few good guys we had been forecasting on the expense side that didn't materialize and there were a few expense bad guys around insurance accruals and legal settlements that we had not forecasted that negatively impacted us.
Programming costs for residential sub, including an intercompany charge for market-rate RSN deals, increased 12.5% to a little over $39. Keep in mind that the launches of new networks, such as the SEC Network last summer, somewhat skewed the year-over-year programming cost comparison. These new launches will, obviously, impact 2015 programming cost growth as well.
Tech ops and customer care together increased $42 million or 7.5%. The investments we're making in these areas have been instrumental in building a better customer experience. Higher sales expense in the quarter was more than offset by lower marketing costs, particularly in the areas of broadcast and production costs, as we have strategically reallocated our marketing investment to sales channels, such as inbound sales and direct sales reps.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was very strong at $2.03, up 11.5%. And for the year, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14.4% to $7.56. I would remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, share count reduction now has a smaller impact on EPS growth. In fact, not much at all in Q4.
Free cash flow was $891 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, free cash flow of $2.3 billion was down 9.9% from 2013, primarily due to higher capital expenditures.
CapEx of $4.1 billion in 2014 increased by almost $900 million from 2013, reflecting improvements to the plant, our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable set-tops across the footprint.
We also continue to invest in the future growth of business services. We connected nearly 70,000 buildings to our network in 2014, bringing the total number of connected buildings to 930,000.
So net-net, I am very pleased with our continued momentum, and until we close, we will run as hard as we can to the finish line and make good on our promise to deliver the company to Comcast in very good shape.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

And actually, what we sort of refer to as monthly recurring ARPU, that was actually up slightly. The other item I would just sort of point out when you think about ARPU, you'll recall when -- that this year, in '14, was the first year we moved to what we call unified rate strategy, meaning that no matter what sort of bundle you are in, whether you're double play, triple play, you receive one rate increase a year. That's different and causes comparisons to '13, when we were sort of doing more product rate increases, meaning if you were a double or a triple, you could actually get multiple rate increases throughout the year. So that, obviously, has a skewing impact on ARPU growth. What I would point out to you is, we're basically getting right into, in '15, the rollout of our '15 rate increases. So you should expect a step-up in ARPU from rates and fees that we will be implementing. You'll get a partial quarter impact of that in Q1 and a full quarter impact in Q2."

Sure. First, Laura, on Sling TV, we've been advocates of flexible video packages for quite some time. I think Sling TV is a variation on that theme with only 12 -- I believe, 12 networks, select networks from, I think, 3 providers or 4 providers for a relatively low price. I think it's intriguing in the sense that it reflects a willingness of programmers to deviate from the big bundle packages that we've generally offered. In terms of the attractiveness of Sling TV itself, I'm a little bit skeptical, in that I think we've got a more compelling light, if you will, bundle that happens to be called our Starter video product, Basic cable, for about the same price, but with many more highly rated networks. So I think we'll watch. And we're certainly interested in more flexible packages, but I'm not sure that that's the right one. In terms of net neutrality, I'd rather answer your question not in terms of what if the Comcast deal doesn't close because we remain confident that it will, but I'll talk generally about net neutrality. I think, at this point, I don't have any greater knowledge of exactly what's going to come out of the FCC than you probably do. If we read Chairman Wheeler's recent statements, it appears that they're going down a Title II with forbearance path, but the exact contours of that, I think, remains to be seen. And the impact that anything they come up with will have on our future investment or willingness to invest, I think, will, in part, depend on the details. I think it's -- it almost goes without saying that to the extent what they proffer creates uncertainty around the regulatory regime in which we will be operating, that is likely to chill our enthusiasm for investment. But beyond that general statement, it's hard to say more."

But I think that's really just the beginning, and the idea of utilizing WiFi as a component of a voice offering is pretty intriguing. So I assume what you're referring to is the announcement that Cablevision made earlier this week, and it's pretty intriguing to us. We actually implemented a somewhat similar strategy when we had our MVNO arrangement with Clearwire, in that we offered a small bundle of data. It wasn't a voice product, but it was a WiFi-first data offering with an MVNO cellular backup. And in theory, as the technology for voice over WiFi continues to improve, it's theoretically kind of interesting to think about a variation on what Cablevision is doing. So we're going to watch that, see what the uptake is. I'm not sure that they've struck exactly the right chord in terms of the match between price in the absence of a cellular backup, but I think it's pretty cool."

The reason I don't think Title II has much of an impact is that, today, the types of rules that are being talked about to ensure an open Internet are wholly consistent with our behaviors and wholly consistent with the rest of the ISP industry's behaviors. So I don't think anything is going to change on that front, and usage-based pricing doesn't seem to be a target of any regulations at this point. And so I think that will continue to be something that may evolve with the market.

Our plan in 2014 was to expand our addressable or serviceable business services revenue opportunity by about $1.2 billion. And I think the buildings we connected ended up yielding just about that, but that's sort of -- the actual revenue implications of those kinds of builds are lagging. So what you saw in 2014 in terms of revenue growth was really a product of prior investment as well as continued growth in our sales force and productivity within the sales force. So I think 2014's investment will ultimately yield fruit in '15, '16 and then so on. I don't know if you want to add to that, Artie."

And through most of 2014, we had a $79 triple play offer that was out there. But Q4, what we really did was focus on making sure that the package delivered all the elements that were necessary to enjoy the package without this perception of hidden fees. So one of the things we did is we moved the price from $79.99 to $89, and we added the set-top box to it. And then we also, as Artie mentioned, made a free install for triple plays. I think there were a couple other little moves, but that was the core of the change that we made for Q4. And we really feel good about not just the results of it, but also about the entering position with the relationship with the customer and building trust during the course of the whole year. A couple of other things that we have said about the triple play is that we didn't want to have premiums attached to it that expired after 3 months or 6 months. We wanted to keep everything in that 12-month range, and we also didn't want to have rate increases that would affect those customers within the first 12 months. So that's our overall triple play strategy, and it reflects some minor incremental changes, but nothing tremendous."

In terms of Maxx, as we said, when we first articulated our 3-year plan, our aim is to have 75% of our footprint enabled with Maxx attributes by the end of the 3-year plan period. So -- and my guess is we'll continue to roll it out beyond that, but -- so the only question is prioritization. And obviously, as we think about where to go first, competitive dynamics are a factor. So that includes Google, although it's not explicitly dictated by where Google decides to go. In fact, I think we announced the Carolinas before Google did their announcement this week. So competitive set is certainly relevant, obviously. In terms of urgency around the WiFi-first offering, as I said earlier, I think WiFi-first is an interest as a voice -- WiFi-first voice product is interesting, but we don't have any specific launch plans at this time.

While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation of our other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I'd like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business. In short, I beli",1540,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation of our other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I'd like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business. In short, I believe we are as well-positioned for the future as any company in our industry. To be blunt, that was not the case when we entered 2014 and I couldn't be more pleased with the strides we've made. We have a world-class team and incredibly strong operating momentum and I am confident that will translate into significant financial growth going forward. 
Over the last 16 months, while most people outside our company were focused more on the merger than on what we were actually doing with the business, we've been quietly executing on the operating plan we shared with you before the Comcast deal was announced. While we were confident that the transaction would be consummated, back in February of last year I gave our operating team very clear instructions, in the unlikely event this deal doesn't close, be ready. 
And by being ready, I meant getting the residential operations in the strongest position possible by putting the right people in the right jobs, investing in our network and customer premises equipment, enhancing our products, improving customer service and making sure our marketing, sales and retention machine was functioning at a really high level. 
By being ready, I also meant making sure we continue to see the huge opportunity we have in Business Services. By expanding our network, adding into our product portfolio, automating and standardizing our process and improving productivity. As I sit here today, I will tell you that our team surpassed my wildest expectations. Despite all the merger-related distractions, they never took their eyes off the ball. Our steadily improving operating results over the last 5 quarters are a reflection of those efforts. And our Q1 performance is the clearest sign yet that we are as operationally strong as we've been in many years. As I said last week, we are strong and getting stronger and I couldn't be prouder to lead this organization. 
By almost any measure, Q1 was our best subscriber quarter ever. We added the most customer relationships ever, the most triple plays ever, the most PSUs ever and the most voice customers ever. And very notably, for the first time since the first quarter of 2009, we added video subs. And we did that while improving the overall quality of our subscriber base. More customers taking higher tiers of service, paying us more for those services and sticking with us longer. That's a potent combination that we are confident sets us up well for accelerated top line growth in the latter part of this year and even more so next year. 
So what's behind the dramatic improvement? The short answer is, we're simply executing better across every facet of our business. I'm sure Dinni, who's really been leading the charge, will give you his perspectives during Q&A. But let me share my view of some of the things that are making a difference. 
First is customer service. Our network operations, care and tech ops teams are playing at the top of their game. During 2014, we made significant investments to improve the reliability of our network. As we've discussed before, our advanced diagnostic tools now allow us to identify those components of our plan that are likely to result in customer impacting issues. We've been using that information to proactively address network problems before they have an impact on our customers. In and of itself, that's obviously good for customers. But it also means we're getting fewer calls to our call centers. Less activity in the call centers allows us to improve service levels, which is the speed in which we answer our calls. And it gives our reps more time to effectively address those problems that do arise. 
We've also invested in better training and tools for our reps so more problems can be held over the phone. In Q1, that resulted in 15% fewer truck rolls for repairs than a year ago and 27% fewer than in the first quarter of 2013. When we do roll a truck, we're giving customers industry-leading 1-hour service windows. And in Q1, we arrived within those windows an impressive 97% of the time. That's an all-time high. And we're continuing to add weekend and nighttime appointments as well. In short, we're serving customers on their schedules rather than ours. 
Not only we made great strides in customer service, but our products are better too. We're completing the rollout of a fivefold increase in VOD capacity this quarter. We've also continued to enhance our TWC TV screening app. In fact, we recently added TWC TV to the Xbox One platform, customers are responding enthusiastically. We set another all-time usage in March with 55% more visits than a year earlier. At the same time, we've continued to expand our WiFi network. And March usage was more than 3x higher than last years. And we continue to add value to our phone products. As of this month, our phone customers can make unlimited calls to India for no additional charge. We already include unlimited call to Mexico and China so TWC phone customers now have unlimited access to around 40% of the world's population. 
We continue to install new more capable equipment in our customers homes, we accelerate the pace in the first quarter, installing almost 2.4 million new modems, set-top boxes and digital adapters. 
And TWC Maxx continues to perform to transform the customer experience from millions of households in the TWC footprint. With Maxx, customers get greater reliability, All Digital video, standard tier speeds of 50 megabits per second and higher tiers of service, which speeds up to 300 megabits per second. New York City, L.A. and Austin are complete, Dallas, San Antonio and Kansas City are underway, and Charlotte, Raleigh and Hawaii are on the docket for later in the year. We also plan to begin the Maxx process in San Diego this year and finish up in early 2016. It's still early days, but Maxx certainly appears to be making a difference. Customer feedback has been great and churn among Maxx customers with new DOCSIS 3.0 modems is dramatically low. 
And with all these customer experience enhancements as a backdrop, our customer acquisition retention machine is firing on all cylinders. The robust $90 triple play offer that we introduced back in October continued to resonate with customers and drove meaningful year-over-year improvements in connect volume. 
Our sales channels performed very well with online growing most significantly. Churn rate and absolute disconnects were also down year-over-year despite the fact that we increased rates and fees in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, quite an achievement. 
In Business Services, I'm convinced that we have the best team in the industry. We again generated terrific results in Q1 as we executed from our proven playbook. For the 15th quarter in a row, the Business Services revenue grew more than $100 million year-over-year. And with improving margins, Business Services with the contribution is growing even faster than the top line. 
And we continued to invest for the future. At quarter end, we've got 911,000 commercial buildings on-net, which sets us up well for future sales growth. Our Q1 revenue run rate was over $3.1 billion and we're right on track to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2018. 
So in summary, I feel great about the overall health and trajectory of our business. We've made significant investments to drive performance and those investments are paying off. We are a far stronger company than we were just 5 short quarters ago. 
As we look towards the balance of 2015, from an operating perspective, we'll keep doing what we've done so well for the last 16 months including continuing to make the necessary investments to set us up operationally and financially for 2016 and beyond. 
As for capital allocation, the fact that we've deleveraged while we waited for deal approval is not lost on us. It's been a busy week but rest assured, we will be working with our board on our go-forward plans with respect to dividends and buybacks. 
Before I pass it over to Artie, and with the Comcast merger now in our rearview mirror, I want to reiterate a couple of things that I said to you back in January of last year on my first earnings call as Time Warner Cable's CEO. I told you that I believe Time Warner Cable had terrific assets, a world-class team and a well architected operating plan. And that I was confident in our ability to drive growth. I also told you that I was totally committed to maximizing shareholder value. Both of those statements are as true today as they were 15 months ago. I firmly believe that everything we've done over the last year plus validates what I said back then. We look forward to your continued support as we move this great company forward. 
Now, let me turn it over to Artie to cover the key takeaways from our first quarter results. Artie?"
862598,290267254,798541,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I would like to start by echoing Rob's remarks that we are incredibly appreciative of the efforts of our entire organization over the last 16 months.

I would like to start by echoing Rob's remarks that we are incredibly appreciative of the efforts of our entire organization over the last 16 months. Under at best, uncertain and at times difficult circumstances our employees performed really well and I would note both admirably and with grace under pressure. We are stronger and better today because of their efforts. 
Before I get into our results today, to help set some overall context, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing what we said we would do 15 months ago when we laid out our 3-year plan. To summarize, our remarks on the January 2014 call, we said that over the next 3 years: First, we would improve the overall residential experience; second, we would continue to aggressively drive Business Services toward our 2018 revenue target of $5 billion; third, we would pursue operating efficiencies and more than offset cost pressure in programming and make investments in tech ops and care in order to improve the customer experience; and fourth, we would meaningfully increase CapEx with our particular focus on plant reliability and making sure our customers have the best CPE available. 
I think our results today demonstrate that we have made great strides in these 4 areas. Our residential operating performance is the best in years. Business Services continues to deliver excellent results. And despite the fact that we've had very significant growth in recent years, we still have tremendous opportunities for growth given our relatively low market share. Our initiatives surround TWC Maxx, plant reliability and CPE replacement are resulting in happier customers and our operations running much smoother. 
And despite the merger-related distractions, we made good strides in cost areas such as phone cost, optimizing our marketing spend, as well as shared functions where expenses were flat year-over-year. I do think there are some remaining opportunities in cost and it is something we will continue to be diligent about. 
Of course, the proof of the success of our operating initiatives is in the metrics. We said back in January 2014 that the operating measures of success would be improved plant and product reliability metrics, reduced call volumes, increased customer satisfaction, lower customer churn and better connect volumes. For those of you keeping score in our recent operating performance, I would give us very high marks across-the-board. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q1 highlights starting with customer relationships where we performed exceptionally well. On the residential side, we gained 205,000 customer relationships in Q1. And in Business Services, we added 14,000 customer relationships. So on a combined basis, we had our best results ever. 
The Q1 residential CR performance was driven by a 5% increase in connects, coupled by a 2% improvement in disconnects. Much of the connect strength this quarter was driven by online sales. Connect activity was strong in all of our geographic regions, customer relationship net adds were particularly strong in the Pac West of which the Los Angeles Metro area is the largest component. 
PSU performance in Q1 also was outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 665,000 were 323,000 better than last year's Q1 and 688,000 better than in 2013. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 298,000 were the best ever. Triples were 39% of customers relationship connects in Q1, similar to the rate in Q4 but twice the selling rate of a year ago. 
On an individual product basis, residential video net adds of 30,000 represent a milestone as it was the first positive video quarter since the first quarter of 2009. Recall that May and June are seasonally tougher. But I will tell you, that we did a positive video net adds in the month of April. The story in terms of video sub quality is also a good one. The real action was at the high-end which generated more than 100% of this quarter's video net adds. 
Broadband volume also was very strong. Residential net adds of 315,000 were the best for a first quarter in 8 years. Again, the quality of the subscriber base continues to increase as our highest speed tiers experience virtually all of the inflow. Our light tier, on the other hand, generated less than 13% of connects, down from a year ago. 
Phone net adds of 320,000 were the strongest ever. This has helped us drive triple play sell in and we also continued to benefit from new product rollouts in phone such as free call into Mexico, China and now, India. 
With that, let's move on to our Q1 financial results. Let me start by saying that despite the fact that adjusted OIBDA had grown 0.8%, I am pleased with our overall financial performance. I'll provide some context around the bigger picture in a few minutes. But first, I'll walk you through a more granular review of the numbers. 
Let me start with total revenue which was $5.8 billion, up 3.5% year-over-year. We grew Residential Services revenue by $94 million or 2.1%, the highest organic year-over-year Residential revenue growth in over 3 years. We implemented certain fee and rate increases in the quarter that benefited ARPU and new connect ARPU was 2.3%. Revenue performance of the video product was notably better in Q1 with video ARPU increasing 2.3% year-over-year. 
In Residential, we talked for some time about returning to a more balanced mixture of volume and rate. This quarter, we've reached that more sustainable balance. In Q1, roughly 50% of the revenue growth was driven by rate and 50% by volume. This will bounce around a little bit based on the timing of rate increases and normal seasonality but the goal is to strike that balance. 
In Business Services, revenue increased $113 million or 16.9% year-over-year in Q1. This is now a big business and we're getting the scale efficiency as we planned for. In the first quarter, Business Services' contribution margin grew by 19.2%, resulting in overall margin expanding 110 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. 
High-speed data led the same with year-over-year revenue growth of almost 23%. Within that category, dedicated Internet access is experiencing the fastest growth. 
Other operations revenue declined 0.5% in Q1. Media sales revenue was down $17 million from last year. Roughly half of the decline was due to the well-known cyclicality of political advertising. And the rest I think reflects a generally soft TV advertising environment right now, particularly in tune-in where our local ad sales in New York and L.A. were impacted. 
First quarter other revenue increased primarily due to affiliate freeze from our Residential Services segment for SportsNet L.A. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. As noted, we grew total company adjusted OIBDA 0.8% in Q1 as operating expenses grew 5%. 
Let me make 3 points about what's driving this. 
First, there are certain areas where we're making aggressive investments, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $49 million or 8.5%. The entire rationale behind the spending is to serve customers better, enabling us over time to improve ARPU and reduce churn. We are very confident in our ability to continue to drive better financial performance through these investments. 
Second, we've seen expense growth in a couple of categories that, frankly, were higher than we'd like. Company-wide programming and content cost grew $110 million or 8.4% year-over-year in the first quarter and programming cost for residential basic sub grew 12.2%. The programming growth rate was impacted by new network launches like SEC Network and the Dodgers RSN. But even normalizing for those, we would still be north of 10% on a per basic sub basis. In addition, we have significant pension expense, I don't think investors focused much on this because many of our peers don't have the defined benefit plans. But the expense grew $26 million year-over-year in Q1 representing 130 basis points of adjusted OIBDA growth. 
And third, there are some areas where we have been able to exercise tremendous cost discipline. Most notable here are the shared function operating cost associated with broad corporate functions like accounting and finance, IT, legal and HR where we had held expenses flat year-over-year at $727 million. I will tell you that we're vigilant on shared cost. 
Another way of looking at OIBDA growth in Q1, if you exclude the decline in advertising revenue and the increase in pension expense, our adjusted OIBDA growth would have been 3%. Now looking at the bigger picture, we're just about where we expected to be. As we contemplated in our 3-year plan, 2015 is a transitional year, focused more on sub growth now which we expect will drive significant financial growth in 2016. It is the case that our 2015 revenue and adjusted OIBDA expectations are below a very stale consensus. And I recognize that by not giving 2015 guidance on our last earnings call, we didn't help bridge that gap. 
So given some of the headwinds I discussed in pension, Dodgers and ad sales, as well as the operating investments we're making, let me tell you that we expect 2015 to be flattish from an adjusted OIBDA growth standpoint. 
Looking forward, we are confident that 2016 will be very strong from a financial standpoint with adjusted OIBDA of around $9 billion. Think of the business like a flywheel, it takes a lot of energy to get the flywheel going. But once it is going, it's momentum will keep it spinning for a long time. Similarly, in our business, you have too spend to get the subscriber machine running. But once it's running like our flywheel is now, you're in a great position to deliver strong, sustainable financial growth. 
Moving down the income statement. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.65, down $0.13 from a year ago. One of the biggest drivers of lower EPS in Q1 was depreciation expense which again is a clear reflection of the massive investments we're making to improve the operations and future prospects of this company. And I would remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, shares outstanding were actually up 4 million year-over-year. This compares to the prior year 2 years when shares outstanding were coming down at least 14 million shares a year. 
Free cash flow was $407 million in the first quarter, down $222 million year-over-year. Primarily due to the $300 million year-over-year increase in capital investments. Remember also that while bonus depreciation was extended at the end of 2014, it happened so late in the year that we had treated all of our 2014 federal tax payments as if it wouldn't be extended. And since we don't make a payment in Q1, we'll get a Q2 benefit of approximately $120 million due to the overpayment of federal taxes last year. 
CapEx of $1.1 billion in the first quarter was the highest ever in a first quarter, reflecting improvements to the plan, our aggressive investments in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, digital adapters and modems in Maxx markets and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable set-tops across the footprint. 
We also continued to invest in the future growth of Business Services. We connected nearly 12,000 commercial buildings to our network in Q1 and increased our serviceable revenue opportunity to approximately $18 billion. As indicated, we were spending aggressively on CapEx ahead of the anticipated merger closing. Coupling that with our initiatives to the rest of 2015 will result in full year CapEx being a little higher than last year. 
Finally, we are also working through our go-forward capital allocation plans with the board, as Rob noted. We obviously delevered over the last 14 months and are currently levered at approximately 2.9x with the usual adjustments. We realized that smart capital allocation including buybacks and dividend increases has been a big part of the Time Warner Cable story and we expect it to be in the future along with the opportunity for significant go-forward value creation from ongoing improvements in operations. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

So look, I think we feel very good about the quality of the subs. Customers are coming in at higher tiers of service. In video, we added 30,000 video customers. In fact, we added close to 150,000 to our Preferred tier of service. Similarly, HSD customers are coming in at higher tiers of service, higher-speed tiers. And interestingly enough, we are less reliant for growth than we had been in the past on our light tiers of HSD service. So I think all this bodes well for ARPU improvements down the road and I'm not troubled at all by what seems like lower ARPU growth than we've had in the past."

While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation about other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I'd like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business. In short, I belie",1546,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation about other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I'd like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business. In short, I believe we are as well positioned for the future as any company in our industry. To be blunt, that was not the case when we entered 2014, and I couldn't be more pleased with the strides we've made. We have a world-class team and incredibly strong operating momentum, and I am confident that will translate into significant financial growth going forward. 
Over the last 16 months, while most people outside our company were focused more on the merger than on what we were actually doing with the business, we've been quietly executing on the operating plan we shared with you before the Comcast deal was announced. While we were confident that the transaction would be consummated, back in February of last year, I gave our operating team very clear instructions, in the unlikely event this deal doesn't close, be ready. 
And by being ready, I meant getting the residential operations in the strongest position possible by putting the right people in the right jobs, investing in our network and customer premises equipment, enhancing our products, improving customer service and making sure our marketing, sales and retention machine was functioning at a really high level. 
By being ready, I also meant making sure we continue to see the huge opportunity we have in Business Services, by expanding our network, adding to our product portfolio, automating and standardizing our processes and improving productivity. As I sit here today, I will tell you that our team surpassed my wildest expectations. Despite all the merger-related distractions, they never took their eyes off the ball. Our steadily improving operating results over the last 5 quarters are a reflection of those efforts. And our Q1 performance is the clearest sign yet that we are as operationally strong as we've been in many years. As I said last week, we are strong and getting stronger, and I couldn't be prouder to lead this organization. 
By almost any measure, Q1 was our best subscriber quarter ever. We added the most customer relationships ever, the most triple plays ever, the most PSUs ever and the most voice customers ever. And very notably, for the first time since the first quarter of 2009, we added video subs. And we did that while improving the overall quality of our subscriber base. More customers taking higher tiers of service, paying us more for those services and sticking with us longer. That's a potent combination that we are confident sets us up well for accelerated top line growth in the latter part of this year and even more so next year. 
So what's behind the dramatic improvement? The short answer is, we're simply executing better across every facet of our business. I'm sure, Dinni, who's really been leading the charge, will give you his perspectives during Q&A, but let me share my view of some of the things that are making a difference. 
First is customer service. Our network operations, care and tech ops teams are playing at the top of their game. During 2014, we made significant investments to improve the reliability of our network. As we've discussed before, our advanced diagnostic tools now allow us to identify those components of our plant that are likely to result in customer impacting issues. We've been using that information to proactively address network problems before they have an impact on their -- on our customers. In and of itself, that's obviously good for customers, but it also means we're getting fewer repair calls into our call centers. Less activity in the call centers allows us to improve service levels, which is the speed with which we answer our calls. And it gives our reps more time to effectively address those problems that do arise. 
We've also invested in better training and tools for our reps, so more problems can be held over the phone. In Q1, that resulted in 15% fewer truck rolls for repairs than a year ago, and 27% fewer than in the first quarter of 2013. When we do roll a truck, we're giving customers industry-leading 1-hour service windows. And in Q1, we arrived within those windows an impressive 97% of the time. That's an all-time high. And we're continuing to add weekend and nighttime appointments as well. In short, we're serving customers on their schedules rather than ours. 
Not only have we made great strides in customer service, but our products are better too. We're completing the rollout of a fivefold increase in VOD capacity this quarter. We've also continued to enhance our TWC TV streaming app. In fact, we recently added TWC TV to the Xbox One platform. Customers are responding enthusiastically. We set another all-time usage record in March with 55% more visits than a year earlier. At the same time, we've continued to expand our WiFi network, and March usage was more than 3x higher than last years. And we continue to add value to our phone product. As of this month, our phone customers can make unlimited calls to India for no additional charge. We already included unlimited calls to Mexico and China, so TWC phone customers now have unlimited access to around 40% of the world's population. 
We continue to install new, more capable equipment in our customers' homes. We accelerated the pace in the first quarter, installing almost 2.4 million new modems, set-top boxes and digital adapters. 
And TWC Maxx continues to perform -- to transform the customer experience from millions of households in the TWC footprint. With Maxx, customers get greater reliability, all digital video, standard tier speeds of 50 megabits per second and higher tiers of service, which speeds up to 300 megabits per second. New York City, L.A. and Austin are complete; Dallas, San Antonio and Kansas City are underway; and Charlotte, Raleigh and Hawaii are on the docket for later in the year. We also plan to begin the Maxx process in San Diego this year and finish up in early 2016. It's still early days, but Maxx certainly appears to be making a difference. Customer feedback has been great and churn among Maxx customers with new DOCSIS 3.0 modems is dramatically low. 
And with all these customer experience enhancements as a backdrop, our customer acquisition and retention machine is firing on all cylinders. The robust $90 triple play offer that we introduced back in October continued to resonate with customers and drove meaningful year-over-year improvements in connect volume. 
Our sales channels performed very well with online growing most significantly. Churn rate and absolute disconnects were also down year-over-year, despite the fact that we increased rates and fees in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, quite an achievement. 
In Business Services, I'm convinced that we have the best team in the industry. We again generated terrific results in Q1, as we executed from our proven playbook. For the 15th quarter in a row, Business Services revenue grew more than $100 million year-over-year. And with improving margins, Business Services [indiscernible] contribution is growing even faster than the top line; and we continue to invest for the future. At quarter end, we got 911,000 commercial buildings on-net, which sets us up well for future sales growth. Our Q1 revenue run rate was over $3.1 billion and we're right on track to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2018. 
So in summary, I feel great about the overall health and trajectory of our business. We've made significant investments to drive performance and those investments are paying off. We are a far stronger company than we were just 5 short quarters ago. 
As we look towards the balance of 2015, from an operating perspective, we'll keep doing what we've done so well for the last 16 months, including continuing to make the necessary investments to set us up operationally and financially for 2016 and beyond. 
As for capital allocation, the fact that we've deleveraged while we waited for deal approval is not lost on us. It's been a busy week but rest assured, we will be working with our board on our go-forward plans with respect to dividends and buybacks. 
Before I pass it over to Artie, and with the Comcast merger now in our rearview mirror, I want to reiterate a couple of things that I said to you back in January of last year on my first earnings call as Time Warner Cable's CEO. I told you that I believe Time Warner Cable had terrific assets, a world-class team and a well architected operating plan. And that I was confident in our ability to drive growth. I also told you that I was totally committed to maximizing shareholder value. Both of those statements are as true today as they were 15 months ago. I firmly believe that everything we've done over the last year plus validates what I said back then. We look forward to your continued support as we move this great company forward. 
Now, let me turn it over to Artie to cover the key takeaways from our first quarter results. Artie?"
862598,290267254,798891,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by echoing Rob's remarks that we are incredibly appreciative of the efforts of our entire organization over the last 16 months.

I would like to start by echoing Rob's remarks that we are incredibly appreciative of the efforts of our entire organization over the last 16 months. Under at best, uncertain and at times difficult circumstances, our employees performed really well, and I would note both admirably and with grace under pressure. We are stronger and better today because of their efforts. 
Before I get into our results today, to help set some overall context, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing what we said we would do 15 months ago when we laid out our 3-year plan. To summarize our remarks on the January 2014 call, we said that over the next 3 years, first, we would improve the overall residential experience; second, we would continue to aggressively drive Business Services toward our 2018 revenue target of $5 billion; third, we would pursue operating efficiencies in order to offset cost pressure and programming, and make investments in tech ops and care in order to improve the customer experience; and fourth, we would meaningfully increase CapEx with a particular focus on plant reliability and making sure our customers have the best CPE available. 
I think our results today demonstrate that we have made great strides in these 4 areas. Our residential operating performance is the best in years. Business Services continues to deliver excellent results. And despite the fact that we've had very significant growth in recent years, we still have tremendous opportunities for growth given our relatively low market share. Our initiatives surround TWC Maxx, plant reliability and CPE replacement are resulting in happier customers and our operations running much smoother. 
And despite the merger-related distractions, we made good strides in cost areas such as phone costs, optimizing our marketing spend as well as shared functions, where expenses were flat year-over-year. I do think there are some remaining opportunities in costs and it is something we will continue to be diligent about. 
Of course, the proof of the success of our operating initiatives is in the metrics. We said back in January 2014 that the operating measures of success would be improved plant and product reliability metrics, reduced call volumes, increased customer satisfaction, lower customer churn and better connect volumes. For those of you keeping score on our recent operating performance, that would give us very high marks across the board. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q1 highlights starting with customer relationships where we performed exceptionally well. On the Residential side, we gained 205,000 customer relationships in Q1. And in Business Services, we added 14,000 customer relationships. So on a combined basis, we had our best results ever. 
The Q1 residential CR performance was driven by a 5% increase in connects, coupled with a 2% improvement in disconnects. Much of the connect strength this quarter was driven by online sales. Connect activity was strong in all of our geographic regions, customer relationship net adds were particularly strong in the Pac West, of which the Los Angeles metro area is the largest component. 
PSU performance in Q1 also was outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 665,000 were 323,000 better than last year's Q1 and 688,000 better than in 2013. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 298,000 were the best ever. Triples were 39% of customer relationship connects in Q1, similar to the rate in Q4, but twice the selling rate of a year ago. 
On an individual product basis, residential video net adds of 30,000 represent a milestone, as it was the first positive video quarter since the first quarter of 2009. Recall that May and June are seasonally tougher, but I will tell you that we did a positive video net adds in the month of April. The story in terms of video sub quality is also a good one. The real action was at the high-end, which generated more than 100% of this quarter's video net adds. 
Broadband volume also was very strong. Residential net adds of 315,000 were the best for a first quarter in 8 years. Again, the quality of the subscriber base continues to increase as our highest speed tiers experience virtually all of the inflow. Our light tier, on the other hand, generated less than 13% of connects, down from a year ago. 
Phone net adds of 320,000 were the strongest ever. This has helped us drive triple play sell-in, and we also continue to benefit from new product rollouts in phone, such as free call into Mexico, China and now, India. 
With that, let's move on to our Q1 financial results. Let me start by saying that despite the fact that adjusted OIBDA grew only 0.8%, I am pleased with our overall financial performance. I'll provide some context around the bigger picture in a few minutes. But first, I'll walk you through a more granular review of the numbers. 
Let me start with total revenue which was $5.8 billion, up 3.5% year-over-year. We grew Residential Services revenue by $94 million or 2.1%, the highest organic year-over-year residential revenue growth in over 3 years. We implemented certain fee and rate increases in the quarter that benefited ARPU. And new connect ARPU was up 2.3%. Revenue performance of the video product was notably better in Q1 with video ARPU increasing 2.3% year-over-year. 
In Residential, we talked for some time about returning to a more balanced mixture of volume and rate. This quarter, we reached that more sustainable balance. In Q1, roughly 50% of the revenue growth was driven by rate and 50% by volume. This will bounce around a little bit based on the timing of rate increases and normal seasonality, but the goal is to strike that balance. 
In Business Services, revenue increased $113 million or 16.9% year-over-year in Q1. This is now a big business and we're getting the scale efficiency as we plan for. In the first quarter, Business Services' contribution margin grew by 19.2%, resulting in overall margin expanding 110 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. 
High-speed data led the statement with year-over-year revenue growth of almost 23%. Within that category, dedicated Internet access is experiencing the fastest growth. 
Other operations revenue declined 0.5% in Q1. Media sales revenue was down $17 million from last year. Roughly half of the decline was due to the well-known cyclicality of political advertising. And the rest, I think, reflects a generally soft TV advertising environment right now, particularly in tune-in where our local ad sales in New York and L.A. were impacted. 
First quarter other revenue increased primarily due to affiliate freeze from our Residential Services segment for SportsNet LA. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. As noted, we grew total company adjusted OIBDA 0.8% in Q1, as operating expenses grew 5%. 
Let me make 3 points about what is driving this. First, there are certain areas where we're making aggressive investments, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $49 million or 8.5%. The entire rationale behind this spending is to serve customers better, enabling us over time to improve ARPU and reduce churn. We are very confident in our ability to continue to drive better financial performance through these investments. 
Second, we've seen expense growth in a couple of categories that, frankly, were higher than we'd like. Company-wide programming and content costs grew $110 million or 8.4% year-over-year in the first quarter and programming costs per residential basic sub grew 12.2%. The programming growth rate was impacted by new network launches like SEC Network and the Dodgers RSN. But even normalizing for those, we would still be north of 10% on a per basic sub basis. In addition, we have significant pension expense. I don't think investors focus much on this because many of our peers don't have the defined benefit plans, but the expense grew $26 million year-over-year in Q1, representing 130 basis points of adjusted OIBDA growth. 
And third, there are some areas where we have been able to exercise tremendous cost discipline. Most notable here are the shared function operating costs associated with broad corporate functions like accounting and finance, IT, legal and HR, where we had held expenses flat year-over-year at $727 million. I will tell you that we're vigilant on shared costs. 
Another way to look at OIBDA growth in Q1, if you exclude the decline in advertising revenue and the increase in pension expense, our adjusted OIBDA growth would have been 3%. Now looking at the bigger picture, we're just about where we expected to be. As we contemplated in our 3-year plan, 2015 is a transitional year, focused more on sub growth now, which we expect will drive significant financial growth in 2016. It is the case that our 2015 revenue and adjusted OIBDA expectations are below a very stale consensus. And I recognize that by not giving 2015 guidance on our last earnings call, we didn't help bridge that gap. 
So given some of the headwinds I discussed in pension, Dodgers and ad sales as well as the operating investments we're making, let me tell you that we expect 2015 to be flattish from an adjusted OIBDA growth standpoint. 
Looking forward, we are confident that 2016 will be very strong from a financial standpoint with adjusted OIBDA of around $9 billion. Think of the business like a flywheel, it takes a lot of energy to get the flywheel going. But once it is going, it's momentum will keep it spinning for a long time. Similarly, in our business, you have to spend to get the subscriber machine running. But once it's running like our flywheel is now, you're in a great position to deliver strong, sustainable financial growth. 
Moving down the income statement. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.65, down $0.13 from a year ago. One of the biggest drivers of lower EPS in Q1 was depreciation expense, which again is a clear reflection of the massive investments we're making to improve the operations and future prospects of this company. And I would remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, shares outstanding were actually up 4 million year-over-year. This compares to the prior 2 years when shares outstanding were coming down at least 14 million shares a year. 
Free cash flow was $407 million in the first quarter, down $222 million year-over-year, primarily due to the $300 million year-over-year increase in capital investments. Remember also that while bonus depreciation was extended at the end of 2014, it happened so late in the year that we had treated all of our 2014 federal tax payments as if it wouldn't be extended. And since we don't make a payment in Q1, we'll get a Q2 benefit of approximately $120 million due to the overpayment of federal taxes last year. 
CapEx of $1.1 billion in the first quarter was the highest ever in a first quarter, reflecting improvements to the plan, our aggressive investments in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, digital adapters and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable set-tops across the footprint. 
We also continued to invest in the future growth of Business Services. We connected nearly 12,000 commercial buildings to our network in Q1 and increased our serviceable revenue opportunity to approximately $18 billion. As we indicated, we were spending aggressively on CapEx ahead of the anticipated merger closing. Coupling that with our initiatives to the rest of 2015 will result in full year CapEx being a little higher than last year. 
Finally, we are also working through our go-forward capital allocation plans with the board, as Rob noted. We obviously delevered over the last 14 months and are currently levered at approximately 2.9x with the usual adjustments. We realize that smart capital allocation, including buybacks and dividend increases, has been a big part of the Time Warner Cable story, and we expect it to be in the future along with the opportunity for significant go-forward value creation from ongoing improvements in operations. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

I think the reality is, there are a lot of jump balls as we call them, every time a customer moves, every time a customer is looking to change, and we are winning a lot more of those jump balls than we were winning last year or the year before. And I think that's a because we are so focused -- we're so focused on a lot of small things from an execution standpoint. And I think we are slowly winning on those things. So I don't think that there is a great answer there for you. We have a triple play offer, that's not dissimilar from a lot of the others in the industry. We're not particularly really aggressive in our offers or in our promotions, but what we are doing is executing very well on both sales and marketing, but particularly in care and tech ops."

So I frankly don't want to get ahead of those conversations either. One, before I turn it over to Rob and Dinni on the ARPU per CR, one thing I will just sort of point out is, we are, which is a good thing, increasing the denominator on customer relationships. We are adding new customers and they tend to come in at a lower ARPU than the rest of the base. The good news is they're coming in, the new customers, at a higher rate than they had in the past.

The better you do in terms of volume, almost definitionally, given that we live in a world where new customers come in on promotional pricing, that means that ARPU comes down and that's why I always counsel against putting too much stock in ARPU on its own. Really what you want to focus on is where overall revenue is going and that's why we're so pleased with the organic revenue growth in residential, which is the best it's been in over 2 years -- 3 years, excuse me. So look, I think we feel very good about the quality of the subs. Customers are coming in at higher tiers of service. In video, we added 30,000 video customers. In fact, we added close to 150,000 to our preferred tier of service. Similarly, HSD customers are coming in at higher tiers of service, higher-speed tiers. And interestingly enough, we are less reliant for growth than we had been in the past on our light tiers of HSD service. So I think all of this bodes well for ARPU improvements down the road, and I'm not troubled at all by what seems like lower ARPU growth than we've had in the past."

While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation about other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I'd like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business. In short, I belie",1546,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation about other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I'd like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business. In short, I believe we are as well positioned for the future as any company in our industry. To be blunt, that was not the case when we entered 2014, and I couldn't be more pleased with the strides we've made. We have a world-class team and incredibly strong operating momentum, and I am confident that will translate into significant financial growth going forward. 
Over the last 16 months, while most people outside our company were focused more on the merger than on what we were actually doing with the business, we've been quietly executing on the operating plan we shared with you before the Comcast deal was announced. While we were confident that the transaction would be consummated, back in February of last year, I gave our operating team very clear instructions, in the unlikely event this deal doesn't close, be ready. 
And by being ready, I meant getting the residential operations in the strongest position possible by putting the right people in the right jobs, investing in our network and customer premises equipment, enhancing our products, improving customer service and making sure our marketing, sales and retention machine was functioning at a really high level. 
By being ready, I also meant making sure we continue to see the huge opportunity we have in Business Services, by expanding our network, adding to our product portfolio, automating and standardizing our processes and improving productivity. As I sit here today, I will tell you that our team surpassed my wildest expectations. Despite all the merger-related distractions, they never took their eyes off the ball. Our steadily improving operating results over the last 5 quarters are a reflection of those efforts. And our Q1 performance is the clearest sign yet that we are as operationally strong as we've been in many years. As I said last week, we are strong and getting stronger, and I couldn't be prouder to lead this organization. 
By almost any measure, Q1 was our best subscriber quarter ever. We added the most customer relationships ever, the most triple plays ever, the most PSUs ever and the most voice customers ever. And very notably, for the first time since the first quarter of 2009, we added video subs. And we did that while improving the overall quality of our subscriber base. More customers taking higher tiers of service, paying us more for those services and sticking with us longer. That's a potent combination that we are confident sets us up well for accelerated top line growth in the latter part of this year and even more so next year. 
So what's behind the dramatic improvement? The short answer is, we're simply executing better across every facet of our business. I'm sure, Dinni, who's really been leading the charge, will give you his perspectives during Q&A, but let me share my view of some of the things that are making a difference. 
First is customer service. Our network operations, care and tech ops teams are playing at the top of their game. During 2014, we made significant investments to improve the reliability of our network. As we've discussed before, our advanced diagnostic tools now allow us to identify those components of our plant that are likely to result in customer impacting issues. We've been using that information to proactively address network problems before they have an impact on their -- on our customers. In and of itself, that's obviously good for customers, but it also means we're getting fewer repair calls into our call centers. Less activity in the call centers allows us to improve service levels, which is the speed with which we answer our calls. And it gives our reps more time to effectively address those problems that do arise. 
We've also invested in better training and tools for our reps, so more problems can be handled over the phone. In Q1, that resulted in 15% fewer truck rolls for repairs than a year ago, and 27% fewer than in the first quarter of 2013. When we do roll a truck, we're giving customers industry-leading 1-hour service windows. And in Q1, we arrived within those windows an impressive 97% of the time. That's an all-time high. And we're continuing to add weekend and nighttime appointments as well. In short, we're serving customers on their schedules rather than ours. 
Not only have we made great strides in customer service, but our products are better too. We're completing the rollout of a fivefold increase in VOD capacity this quarter. We've also continued to enhance our TWC TV streaming app. In fact, we recently added TWC TV to the Xbox One platform. Customers are responding enthusiastically. We set another all-time usage record in March with 55% more visits than a year earlier. At the same time, we've continued to expand our WiFi network, and March usage was more than 3x higher than last years. And we continue to add value to our phone product. As of this month, our phone customers can make unlimited calls to India for no additional charge. We already included unlimited calls to Mexico and China, so TWC phone customers now have unlimited access to around 40% of the world's population. 
We continue to install new, more capable equipment in our customers' homes. We accelerated the pace in the first quarter, installing almost 2.4 million new modems, set-top boxes and digital adapters. 
And TWC Maxx continues to perform -- to transform the customer experience from millions of households in the TWC footprint. With Maxx, customers get greater reliability, all digital video, standard tier speeds of 50 megabits per second and higher tiers of service, which speeds up to 300 megabits per second. New York City, L.A. and Austin are complete; Dallas, San Antonio and Kansas City are underway; and Charlotte, Raleigh and Hawaii are on the docket for later in the year. We also plan to begin the Maxx process in San Diego this year and finish up in early 2016. It's still early days, but Maxx certainly appears to be making a difference. Customer feedback has been great and churn among Maxx customers with new DOCSIS 3.0 modems is dramatically low. 
And with all these customer experience enhancements as a backdrop, our customer acquisition and retention machine is firing on all cylinders. The robust $90 triple play offer that we introduced back in October continued to resonate with customers and drove meaningful year-over-year improvements in connect volume. 
Our sales channels performed very well with online growing most significantly. Churn rate and absolute disconnects were also down year-over-year, despite the fact that we increased rates and fees in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, quite an achievement. 
In Business Services, I'm convinced that we have the best team in the industry. We again generated terrific results in Q1, as we executed from our proven playbook. For the 15th quarter in a row, Business Services revenue grew more than $100 million year-over-year. And with improving margins, Business Services [indiscernible] contribution is growing even faster than the top line; and we continue to invest for the future. At quarter end, we got 911,000 commercial buildings on-net, which sets us up well for future sales growth. Our Q1 revenue run rate was over $3.1 billion and we're right on track to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2018. 
So in summary, I feel great about the overall health and trajectory of our business. We've made significant investments to drive performance and those investments are paying off. We are a far stronger company than we were just 5 short quarters ago. 
As we look towards the balance of 2015, from an operating perspective, we'll keep doing what we've done so well for the last 16 months, including continuing to make the necessary investments to set us up operationally and financially for 2016 and beyond. 
As for capital allocation, the fact that we've deleveraged while we waited for deal approval is not lost on us. It's been a busy week but rest assured, we will be working with our board on our go-forward plans with respect to dividends and buybacks. 
Before I pass it over to Artie, and with the Comcast merger now in our rearview mirror, I want to reiterate a couple of things that I said to you back in January of last year on my first earnings call as Time Warner Cable's CEO. I told you that I believe Time Warner Cable had terrific assets, a world-class team and a well architected operating plan. And that I was confident in our ability to drive growth. I also told you that I was totally committed to maximizing shareholder value. Both of those statements are as true today as they were 15 months ago. I firmly believe that everything we've done over the last year plus validates what I said back then. We look forward to your continued support as we move this great company forward. 
Now, let me turn it over to Artie to cover the key takeaways from our first quarter results. Artie?"
862598,290267254,799186,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by echoing Rob's remarks that we are incredibly appreciative of the efforts of our entire organization over the last 16 months.

I would like to start by echoing Rob's remarks that we are incredibly appreciative of the efforts of our entire organization over the last 16 months. Under at best, uncertain and at times difficult circumstances, our employees performed really well, and I would note both admirably and with grace under pressure. We are stronger and better today because of their efforts. 
Before I get into our results today, to help set some overall context, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing what we said we would do 15 months ago when we laid out our 3-year plan. To summarize our remarks on the January 2014 call, we said that over the next 3 years, first, we would improve the overall residential experience; second, we would continue to aggressively drive Business Services toward our 2018 revenue target of $5 billion; third, we would pursue operating efficiencies in order to offset cost pressure and programming, and make investments in tech ops and care in order to improve the customer experience; and fourth, we would meaningfully increase CapEx with our particular focus on plant reliability and making sure our customers have the best CPE available. 
I think our results today demonstrate that we have made great strides in these 4 areas. Our residential operating performance is the best in years. Business Services continues to deliver excellent results. And despite the fact that we've had very significant growth in recent years, we still have tremendous opportunities for growth given our relatively low market share. Our initiatives surround TWC Maxx, plant reliability and CPE replacement are resulting in happier customers and our operations running much smoother. 
And despite the merger-related distractions, we made good strides in cost areas such as phone costs, optimizing our marketing spend as well as shared functions, where expenses were flat year-over-year. I do think there are some remaining opportunities in costs and it is something we will continue to be diligent about. 
Of course, the proof of the success of our operating initiatives is in the metrics. We said back in January 2014 that the operating measures of success would be improved plant and product reliability metrics, reduced call volumes, increased customer satisfaction, lower customer churn and better connect volumes. For those of you keeping score on our recent operating performance, I would give us very high marks across the board. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q1 highlights starting with customer relationships where we performed exceptionally well. On the Residential side, we gained 205,000 customer relationships in Q1. And in Business Services, we added 14,000 customer relationships. So on a combined basis, we had our best results ever. 
The Q1 residential CR performance was driven by a 5% increase in connects, coupled with a 2% improvement in disconnects. Much of the connect strength this quarter was driven by online sales. Connect activity was strong in all of our geographic regions, customer relationship net adds were particularly strong in the Pac West, of which the Los Angeles metro area is the largest component. 
PSU performance in Q1 also was outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 665,000 were 323,000 better than last year's Q1 and 688,000 better than in 2013. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 298,000 were the best ever. Triples were 39% of customer relationship connects in Q1, similar to the rate in Q4, but twice the selling rate of a year ago. 
On an individual product basis, residential video net adds of 30,000 represent a milestone, as it was the first positive video quarter since the first quarter of 2009. Recall that May and June are seasonally tougher, but I will tell you that we did have positive video net adds in the month of April. The story in terms of video sub quality is also a good one. The real action was at the high-end, which generated more than 100% of this quarter's video net adds. 
Broadband volume also was very strong. Residential net adds of 315,000 were the best for a first quarter in 8 years. Again, the quality of the subscriber base continues to increase as our highest speed tiers experience virtually all of the inflow. Our light tier, on the other hand, generated less than 13% of connects, down from a year ago. 
Phone net adds of 320,000 were the strongest ever. This has helped us drive triple play sell-in, and we also continue to benefit from new product rollouts in phone, such as free call into Mexico, China and now, India. 
With that, let's move on to our Q1 financial results. Let me start by saying that despite the fact that adjusted OIBDA grew only 0.8%, I am pleased with our overall financial performance. I'll provide some context around the bigger picture in a few minutes. But first, I'll walk you through a more granular review of the numbers. 
Let me start with total revenue which was $5.8 billion, up 3.5% year-over-year. We grew Residential Services revenue by $94 million or 2.1%, the highest organic year-over-year residential revenue growth in over 3 years. We implemented certain fee and rate increases in the quarter that benefited ARPU. And new connect ARPU was up 2.3%. Revenue performance of the video product was notably better in Q1 with video ARPU increasing 2.3% year-over-year. 
In Residential, we talked for some time about returning to a more balanced mixture of volume and rate. This quarter, we reached that more sustainable balance. In Q1, roughly 50% of the revenue growth was driven by rate and 50% by volume. This will bounce around a little bit based on the timing of rate increases and normal seasonality, but the goal is to strike that balance. 
In Business Services, revenue increased $113 million or 16.9% year-over-year in Q1. This is now a big business and we're getting the scale efficiency as we plan for. In the first quarter, Business Services' contribution margin grew by 19.2%, resulting in overall margin expanding 110 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. 
High-speed data led the segment with year-over-year revenue growth of almost 23%. Within that category, dedicated Internet access is experiencing the fastest growth. 
Other operations revenue declined 0.5% in Q1. Media sales revenue was down $17 million from last year. Roughly half of the decline was due to the well-known cyclicality of political advertising. And the rest, I think, reflects a generally soft TV advertising environment right now, particularly in tune-in where our local ad sales in New York and L.A. were impacted. 
First quarter other revenue increased primarily due to affiliate freeze from our Residential Services segment for SportsNet LA. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. As noted, we grew total company adjusted OIBDA 0.8% in Q1, as operating expenses grew 5%. 
Let me make 3 points about what is driving this. First, there are certain areas where we're making aggressive investments, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $49 million or 8.5%. The entire rationale behind this spending is to serve customers better, enabling us over time to improve ARPU and reduce churn. We are very confident in our ability to continue to drive better financial performance through these investments. 
Second, we've seen expense growth in a couple of categories that, frankly, were higher than we'd like. Company-wide programming and content costs grew $110 million or 8.4% year-over-year in the first quarter and programming costs per residential basic sub grew 12.2%. The programming growth rate was impacted by new network launches like SEC Network and the Dodgers RSN. But even normalizing for those, we would still be north of 10% on a per basic sub basis. In addition, we have significant pension expense. I don't think investors focus much on this because many of our peers don't have the defined benefit plans, but the expense grew $26 million year-over-year in Q1, representing 130 basis points of adjusted OIBDA growth. 
And third, there are some areas where we have been able to exercise tremendous cost discipline. Most notable here are the shared function operating costs associated with broad corporate functions like accounting and finance, IT, legal and HR, where we had held expenses flat year-over-year at $727 million. I will tell you that we're vigilant on shared costs. 
Another way to look at OIBDA growth in Q1, if you exclude the decline in advertising revenue and the increase in pension expense, our adjusted OIBDA growth would have been 3%. Now looking at the bigger picture, we're just about where we expected to be. As we contemplated in our 3-year plan, 2015 is a transitional year, focused more on sub growth now, which we expect will drive significant financial growth in 2016. It is the case that our 2015 revenue and adjusted OIBDA expectations are below a very stale consensus. And I recognize that by not giving 2015 guidance on our last earnings call, we didn't help bridge that gap. 
So given some of the headwinds I discussed in pension, Dodgers and ad sales as well as the operating investments we're making, let me tell you that we expect 2015 to be flattish from an adjusted OIBDA growth standpoint. 
Looking forward, we are confident that 2016 will be very strong from a financial standpoint with adjusted OIBDA of around $9 billion. Think of the business like a flywheel, it takes a lot of energy to get the flywheel going. But once it is going, it's momentum will keep it spinning for a long time. Similarly, in our business, you have to spend to get the subscriber machine running. But once it's running like our flywheel is now, you're in a great position to deliver strong, sustainable financial growth. 
Moving down the income statement. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.65, down $0.13 from a year ago. One of the biggest drivers of lower EPS in Q1 was depreciation expense, which again is a clear reflection of the massive investments we're making to improve the operations and future prospects of this company. And I would remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, shares outstanding were actually up 4 million year-over-year. This compares to the prior 2 years when shares outstanding were coming down at least 14 million shares a year. 
Free cash flow was $407 million in the first quarter, down $222 million year-over-year, primarily due to the $300 million year-over-year increase in capital investments. Remember also that while bonus depreciation was extended at the end of 2014, it happened so late in the year that we had treated all of our 2014 federal tax payments as if it wouldn't be extended. And since we don't make a payment in Q1, we'll get a Q2 benefit of approximately $120 million due to the overpayment of federal taxes last year. 
CapEx of $1.1 billion in the first quarter was the highest ever in a first quarter, reflecting improvements to the plan, our aggressive investments in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, digital adapters and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable set-tops across the footprint. 
We also continued to invest in the future growth of Business Services. We connected nearly 12,000 commercial buildings to our network in Q1 and increased our serviceable revenue opportunity to approximately $18 billion. As we indicated, we were spending aggressively on CapEx ahead of the anticipated merger closing. Coupling that with our initiatives to the rest of 2015 will result in full year CapEx being a little higher than last year. 
Finally, we are also working through our go-forward capital allocation plans with the board, as Rob noted. We obviously delevered over the last 14 months and are currently levered at approximately 2.9x with the usual adjustments. We realize that smart capital allocation, including buybacks and dividend increases, has been a big part of the Time Warner Cable story, and we expect it to be in the future along with the opportunity for significant go-forward value creation from ongoing improvements in operations. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

So look, I think we feel very good about the quality of the subs. Customers are coming in at higher tiers of service. In video, we added 30,000 video customers. In fact, we added close to 150,000 to our preferred tier of service. Similarly, HSD customers are coming in at higher tiers of service, higher-speed tiers. And interestingly enough, we are less reliant for growth than we had been in the past on our light tiers of HSD service.

This year when we went out, we went to what we call the unified rate increase, which was one increase to a customer per year regardless of the number of products and that had more of an allocation across the different product lines of that increase.

It was very eventful quarter or, should I say, another in a series of very eventful quarters at Time Warner Cable. In the span of a little more than 1 month, we terminated the Comcast merger and entered into a second and even more attractive agreement with Charter. As this is our first earnings call since the Charter announcement. Let me start there. 
As I've said countless times over the last couple of years, we are and have always been committed to maximizing shareholder value. The Charter deal delivers on that commitment. The combination of Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House will create a leading broadband services and technology company with almost 24 million customers in 41 states. The increased scale of the new company should yield increased investment and greater efficiencies, resulting better product and service and more competition both for consumers and businesses. The deal terms recognize Time Warner Cable's unique value and, I believe, strike the right balance between value certainty and upside opportunity for our shareholders. And we expect that the new company will continue to employ the vast majority of Time Warner Cable's employees. So in short, this is a really good deal all the way around for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. 
We're well into the process of seeking regulatory approvals and planning for integration of our operations. 
Through the drama uncertainty and press coverage, our team impressively maintained its focus on operations, delivering yet another strong quarter. To the Time Warner Cable team, I want to extend my sincere thanks for continuing to exceed my lofty expectations. 
Our second quarter results are the latest in a 6-quarter trend of significant and dramatic operational improvement. We added 66,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive second quarter net additions since 2008 and our best second quarter ever. We added 233,000 triples and more than 0.25 million voice subs, both records for our second quarter, and posted our best video and broadband second quarter in years. 
Recall that when we disclosed our 3-year operating plan 18 months ago, I said that we would add 1 million residential customer relationships over the course of the plan. At the time, we made clear that it was a back-end loaded plan, and I think most of you probably thought it was a pretty ambitious target. While halfway through the plan period, we've added 421,000 residential CRs, which puts us well ahead of schedule. And our subscriber momentum has continued into July, which adds to my confidence that we'll hit or exceed the 1 million customer bogey. 
As for our financial performance in the quarter, top line growth was solid 3.5%, driven by another quarter of exceptionally strong growth in business services as well as organic residential growth, which match Q1 as the best in the last 4 years. As in Q1, we continue to prioritize improving the customer experience, both through investment in the capability and reliability of our network and customer premises equipment and by spending to enhance sales, technical operations and customer care. As a consequence, Q2 adjusted OIBDA, excluding pension expense, was essentially flat. 
The investments we're making are already yielding results. We completed the TWC Maxx deployment in Austin, and we're on track to complete Maxx rollout in Dallas, San Antonio, Raleigh, Charlotte, Kansas City and Hawaii by year-end. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we'll start the Maxx process in San Diego this year and finish it up early next year. And we've now decided to accelerate into this year the start of the Maxx rollout in Wilmington and Greensboro, North Carolina. 
TWC Maxx is all about transforming the Time Warner Cable experience, and it's clearly working. In TWC Maxx cities, customer satisfaction is up and churn is down. In fact, in Q2, in areas with TWC Maxx, we saw a more than 35% reduction in voluntary disconnects for both video and broadband. 
We continue to post improvements in key customer service metrics. In Q2, repair calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 4% and 15%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading 1-hour appointment windows was 98%, an all-time record. And our first visit problem resolution rate also hit a new high. 
Consistent with these statistical achievements, customer satisfaction scores for both tech ops and care are meaningfully higher than a year ago. 
I told you last quarter how critical it was that during the dependency of the Comcast merger, we continue to make investments and run the business as if we were going to run it forever. That approach has certainly paid off, and we have no intention of changing course now that we've agreed to merge with Charter. We're a much healthier company now than we were 24 months ago, and we plan to use the time between signing and closing of the Charter deal to further strengthen our operations. 
In the interest of maintaining continuity and stability, we've put the brakes on some cost-cutting measures that just don't make sense in light of the merger. But otherwise, we're going to stick to our game plan for running the company on a stand-alone basis. If anything, we plan to do more rather than less investing this year to set us up well for next year and beyond. 
As a result of that increased investment and the fact that it doesn't look like we'll get additional distribution of the Dodgers network this season, we now expect full year adjusted OIBDA expansion costs to be down slightly. And by down slightly, I mean something less than 1%. 
We also expect the full year CapEx will be around $4.45 billion, somewhat higher than our previous estimate, as we accelerate the TWC Maxx rollout and continue to upgrade and modernize our network and equipment. This is all part of our overall plan to drive meaningful operating and financial growth in 2016. 
So to sum it up, I'm exceptionally pleased with the deal we were able to strike with Charter, and we're working diligently to provide that deal to closure. At the same time, we're continuing to drive our stand-alone business forward, and our Q2 results are a clear indication that the plan is working. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and Matt Siegel, our acting co-CFOs, who will tagteam to review our Q2 results. So for those of you who don't know them, Bill has been Time Warner Cable's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since 2008, and Matt has served as our Treasurer also since 2008. They are proven leaders with impressive track records and many years of experience in the industry and with the company, and I have great confidence that they'll do a terrific job leading our finance team. 
Per the usual process, after Bill and then Matt comments on the quarter, the three of us, along with Cindy, will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

Let me start with a high-level characterization of the quarter. 
Q2 was marked by stellar subscriber performance and solid financial results, reflecting another really strong quarter in Business Services, healthy top line growth in Residential Services, largely offset by investments to drive future growth and an expected decline in ad sales in an unpolitical year. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the results and believe we're positioning ourselves well for a strong performance in 2016. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q2 highlights, starting with customer relationships where we once again performed exceptionally well. We gained 66,000 residential customer relationships in Q2, making this the best second quarter ever. The Q2 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, coupled with a 3% improvement in disconnects. The 3 key sales channels, inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, all performed significantly better than a year ago. Connect activity was strong in all geographic regions. As in Q1, CR net adds were particularly strong in the PAC West, of which Los Angeles metro area is the largest component, followed by Texas and Midwest. 
Second quarter churn improvements were driven by improvements in both voluntary and nonpaid disconnects. 
PSU performance in Q2 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 379,000 were 385,000 better than last year's Q2 and even better year-over-year performance than in this year's incredibly strong first quarter. The PSU growth was again driven by strong Triple Play net adds. Residential Triple Play net adds of 233,000 were the best for a second quarter ever. Triple Play connects more than doubled year-over-year, and Triple Plays now contribute half of residential's monthly recurring revenue. 
Seasonal headwinds drove a Q2 net decline of 45,000 residential video customers, but notably, that was more than 100,000 better than 1 year ago and the best second quarter performance since 2008. We remain confident that we can achieve positive video net adds for the full year. 
Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 172,000 were also the best for a second quarter since 2008. 
Residential phone net adds of 252,000 were the strongest ever for our second quarter. And while we're thrilled with the growth in our subscriber base, we're also very pleased with the quality the customers are bringing on. ARPU per new connect is pretty stable, and early life churn is down materially, just one indicator that we're generating higher-quality connects. 
Moreover, 38% of new customer connects in Q2 were Triple Plays, which tend to churn less in singles and doubles. 
With that, let's move on to our Q2 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.5% year-over-year. We grew Residential Services revenue by $96 million or 2.1%, matching Q1 for the best organic year-over-year residential revenue growth in the last 4 years. 
Residential ARPU per customer relationship grew 0.4% to $107.41. Remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects and promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base. So it's just math that our success in driving volume in increasing revenue growth is increasing revenue growth but, at the same time, tempering ARPU growth. 
The Mayweather-Pacquiao fight generated around $40 million in revenue, almost 4x the boxing revenue in the year-ago quarter, and drove overall second quarter 2015 pay-per-view revenue higher by $18 million. 
Business services posted another terrific quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 16.2% year-over-year in Q2. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth of $100 million -- of above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 18.1%, contributing more than half of the Business Services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increased came roughly equally from voice, which grew 19.5%, and wholesale transport, which was up 23.7%. 
And second quarter bookings increased 18% sequentially, making Q2 our best bookings quarter ever. In short, Business Services is firing on all cylinders, and we're right on track to reach our $5 billion annual revenue goal for Business Services in 2018. 
Just as significant, we're continuing to run Business Services more efficiently. In the second quarter, Business Services margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year to 59.8%, and Business Services segment adjusted OIBDA grew 17.4%. 
Other operations revenue declined 1.1% in Q2. Media sales revenue was down $9 million from last year, primarily due to the $12 million year-over-year cyclical decline in political advertising. Second quarter other revenue increased primarily due to ours and affiliate fees from our Residential Services segment. These revenues are eliminated in .

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined 1.2% in Q2, and net of a $27 million increase in pension expense was roughly flat with last year's second quarter. 
As we've outlined in recent quarters, we're making aggressive investments in a number of areas, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $52 million or 9%. These functions are instrumentally driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand-in-glove with our network reliability improvements in TWC Maxx deployments. 
Furthermore, we raised sales and marketing expense in the second quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.6%. Roughly 2/3 of the incremental sales and marketing investment was in the Residential segment where we've been raising the staffing levels across all sales channels. For example, we've increased residential direct sales headcount by 33% over the last year. As Bill mentioned, the increased staffing is translating into marked improvement across our sales channels. Similarly, we have continued to hire sales professionals in business services to drive continuing strong revenue growth. Together, these investments are at a core of our efforts to dramatically improved operating performance this year, which we believe will in turn drive significantly stronger financial performance next year. 
The biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA continues to be programming and content costs, which grew $148 million [ph] or 11% year-over-year. The biggest driver was contractual rate increases of roughly $100 million, followed by an increase of around $30 million in Dodgers right fees and pay-per-view cost growth of $16 million. 
In the residential segment, adverse program impressed revenues of was $42.73, up 4 44 [ph] or 11.6% for last year. Excluding the program and cost from the fight, the growth rate was over 9%. 
As we noted last quarter a couple of times over this morning, pension expense increased $27 million in Q2 and $53 million in the first half of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million, roughly $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates. 
We continue to exercise strong cost win our shared functions, which include operating cost associated with broad corporate options like carrying finance, IT, executive management, legal and HR. Expenses increased just 2.6% to $739 million [ph] in the quarter. 
As anticipated, adjusted OIBDA for first half is pretty much flat versus last year. Due to the timing of certain expenses, third quarter adjusted OIBDA, excluding pension expense, could be as much as $100 million lower from last year's third quarter. But as Rob indicated, we expect full year adjusted OIBDA expansion to be down only slightly. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.54, down $0.35 from a year ago. One of the biggest drivers of lower EPS in Q2 was depreciation expense, which again is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to improve the operations and future prospect of the company. Note that Q2 as-reported EPS perfects $120 million gain related to our [indiscernible] with Verizon Wireless, which is excluded from adjusted EPS. 
And I'll remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, average shares outstanding were actually up over 3 million year-over-year. This compares to the prior 2 years when shares outstanding were declining. 
CapEx of $1.3 billion in the second quarter was our highest ever, eclipsing $1.2 billion investing in last year's second quarter. As in recent quarters, perfect strong subscriber growth as well as improvement of plant. Also, our aggressive investments in CPE as we continue to deploy new settops, DTAs and modems in Maxx markets, and our tolerated replacement of order to to across the footprint. 
We also continue to invest in the future growth of business services where we connected 32,000 commercial buildings to our network in the first half of the year. As Rob indicated, you raising our planned 2015 CapEx to $4.45 billion. 
Free cash flow is $440 million [ph] in the second quarter, down $19 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher capital investments. 
At the end of Q2, net debt totaled $22.6 billion, down $439 million from year-end 2014. Significantly, the Charter merger agreement from continued to paying us $3 per share annual dividend between signing and closing. 
We just paid our dividend last week and full expect to continue paying out $0.75 per share each quarter until we close. 
As I mentioned, which has been about programming in conjuction with our announcement of the Comcast deal, and we announcement of the Charter transaction, dividend restart it now. 
So summarize, halfway through our 3-year plan, we're very pleased with our position. Our disciplined execution is paying off significantly strong operating metrics. We anticipate that our more intensive investment this year will drive strong operating financial results in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

So we'll have to see exactly when it gets done. In terms of status, I think most of you saw that the SEC issued a public notice on Monday of this week, stating that it's accepted our application, which is the first step really in the formal part of the process. They also indicated that they would issue another public notice as soon as they worked through and voted upon the protective order that will govern the treatment of confidential information during the process. So we're hopeful that, that's imminent, and that will start the 180-day clock ticking. As for the DOJ, we received our second request last week, and we're in the process of responding to that. And as far as the state and local process, we filed all of our applications for transfers of franchises and so on with the state PUCs that required and the local franchises that required.

I think until we're complete on the rollout of TWC Maxx and until we've retired all of the sort of what I would refer to as last-generation consumer premises equipment, I would expect that CapEx is going to continue at a somewhat elevated rate. But I think, on a longer-time horizon, your point is well taken, which is that as we deliver our video product in IP, it enables customers to use any of their customer-owned IP-enabled devices to consume the video product. And that, in time, will result in fewer customers leasing boxes that we have to spend capital on and more bringing their own device. So I do think that, that, in theory, promises to reduce CPE capital. But I do -- but I think that's a multi-year kind of event. And at this point in time, we're anticipating that we're going to continue to provide the best possible equipment for our customers that we deliver. We do offer customers an opportunity to bring their own modems, and I think it's roughly 12% of our base is bringing their own modems. That means the vast majority of modems is still being purchased by Time Warner Cable. As far as competitiveness in the quarter, I would only say that our connects were up in both FiOS and U-verse markets. And in fact, our connects in U-verse markets were grew -- did better year-over-year than in any other part of the footprint. And on the disconnect side, disconnects were down in both FiOS and U-verse markets, and in fact, we're down most in FiOS markets. So I think the similar characterization of the quarter is that we did well against all competitors, and that gave rise to the really outstanding subscriber results that we reported."

So let's start with user-based pricing, which we've been implementing for some time for explicit tiers of service. That has, from our perspective, never been about managing over-the-top video consumption or discouraging customers from using other people's video product. It's been 100% about matching price and value. So the goal of usage-based pricing was to offer customers who use less bandwidth, who may be just through e-mail an opportunity to pay less and have an Internet offering that better meets their demands for both usage and price. So it's all about customer segmentation and customer choice. With respect to peering, we have both settlement-free peering relationships and paid peering relationships. And to the extent that there is an exchange of money either from us or to us in our peering relationships, those are really designed not to generate an independent revenue stream, to create another business but rather to make sure that there's an alignment of interest between us and the counterparty in how efficiently we utilize available capacity.

And for what we deliver, I continue to believe that it is the best that's out there. The breadth of content is far better than anything that's delivered over-the-top. Quality of the picture is better, and availability of On-Demand choice is better. So I feel like we can compete on that front, and to the extent we don't, shame on us. As far as the impact that more and more direct-to-consumer offerings have on our ability to sell, well, look, as long as the Plainfield is even in cluster comparable, I think we'll be able to compete effectively. To the extent that programmers begin to offer, on a direct basis, their offerings at prices which are either lower than the offering to us on a wholesale basis at or, in some other way come, a more attractive packaging basis, in other words, with more flexibility to package the way they want, well, I think it's going to undercut our ability to sell. And that's going to be a negative for us. But maybe more significantly, to be going to be a negative for the primary distribution channel for all of those video providers.

It was a very eventful quarter, or should I say, another in a series of very eventful quarters at Time Warner Cable. In the span of a little more than 1 month, we terminated the Comcast merger and entered into a second and even more attractive agreement with Charter. As this is our first earnings call since the Charter announcement. Let me start there. As I've said countless times over the last couple of years, we are and have always been committed to maximizing shareholder value. The Charter deal delivers on that commitment. The combination of Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House will create a leading broadband services and technology company, with almost 24 million customers in 41 states. The increased scale of the new company should yield increased investment and greater efficiencies, resulting in better products and service and more competition both for consumers and businesses. The deal terms recognize Time Warner Cable's unique value, and I believe, strike the right balance between value certainty and upside opportunity for our shareholders, and we expect that the new company will continue to employ the vast majority of Time Warner Cable's employees. So in short, this is a really good deal all the way around for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. We're well into the process of seeking regulatory approvals and planning for integration of our operations. Through the drama, uncertainty and press coverage, our team impressively maintained its focus on operations, delivering yet another strong quarter. To the Time Warner Cable team, I want to extend my sincere thanks for continuing to exceed my lofty expectations. 
Our second quarter results are the latest in a 6-quarter trend of significant and dramatic operational improvement. We added 66,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive second quarter net additions since 2008 and our best second quarter ever. We added 233,000 triples and more than 0.25 million voice subs, both records for our second quarter, and posted our best video and broadband second quarter in years.  Recall that when we disclosed our 3-year operating plan 18 months ago, I said that we would add 1 million residential customer relationships over the course of the plan. At the time, we made it clear that it was a back-end loaded plan, and I think most of you probably thought it was a pretty ambitious target. While halfway through the plan period, we've added 421,000 residential CRs, which puts us well ahead of schedule. And our subscriber momentum has continued into July, which adds to my confidence that we'll hit or exceed the 1 million customer bogey. 
As for our financial performance in the quarter, top line growth was solid 3.5%, driven by another quarter of exceptionally strong growth in business services as well as organic residential growth, which match Q1 as the best in the last 4 years. As in Q1, we continued to prioritize improving the customer experience, both through investment in the capability and reliability of our network and customer premises equipment, and by spending to enhance sales, technical operations and customer care. As a consequence, Q2 adjusted OIBDA, excluding pension expense, was essentially flat. The investments we're making are already yielding results. We completed the TWC Maxx deployment in Austin, and we're on track to complete Maxx rollout in Dallas, San Antonio, Raleigh, Charlotte, Kansas City and Hawaii by year-end. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we'll start the Maxx process in San Diego this year, and finish it up early next year, and we've now decided to accelerate into this year the start of the Maxx rollout in Wilmington and Greensboro, North Carolina. 
TWC Maxx is all about transforming the Time Warner Cable experience, and it's clearly working. In TWC Maxx cities, customer satisfaction is up and churn is down. In fact, in Q2, in areas with TWC Maxx, we saw a more than 35% reduction in voluntary disconnects for both video and broadband. We continue to post improvements in key customer service metrics. In Q2, repair calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 4% and 15%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading 1-hour appointment windows was 98%, an all-time record, and our first visit problem resolution rate also hit a new high. Consistent with these statistical achievements, customer satisfaction scores for both tech ops and care are meaningfully higher than a year ago. 
I told you last quarter how critical it was that during the pendency of the Comcast merger, we continued to make investments and run the business as if we were going to run it forever. That approach has certainly paid off, and we have no intention of changing course now that we've agreed to merge with Charter. We're a much healthier company now than we were 24 months ago, and we plan to use the time between signing and closing of the Charter deal to further strengthen our operations. 
In the interest of maintaining continuity and stability, we've put the brakes on some cost-cutting measures that just don't make sense in light of the merger. But otherwise, we're going to stick to our game plan for running the company on a stand-alone basis. If anything, we plan to do more rather than less investing this year to set us up well for next year and beyond. As a result of that increased investment and the fact that it doesn't look like we'll get additional distribution of the Dodgers network this season, we now expect full year adjusted OIBDA expansion costs to be down slightly, and by down slightly, I mean, something less than 1%. We also expect that full year CapEx will be around $4.45 billion, somewhat higher than our previous estimate, as we accelerate the TWC Maxx rollout and continue to upgrade and modernize our network and equipment. This is all part of our overall plan to drive meaningful operating and financial growth in 2016. 
So to sum it up, I'm exceptionally pleased with the deal we were able to strike with Charter, and we're working diligently to bring that deal to closure. At the same time, we're continuing to drive our standalone business forward, and our Q2 results are a clear indication that the plan is working. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and Matt Siegel, our acting co-CFOs, who will tag-team the review of our Q2 results. So for those of you who don't know them, Bill has been Time Warner Cable's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since 2008, and Matt has served as our Treasurer also since 2008. They're proven leaders with impressive track records and many years of experience in the industry and with the company, and I have great confidence that they'll do a terrific job leading our finance team. Per the usual process, after Bill and then Matt comments on the quarter, the three of us, along with Dinni will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

Let me start with a high-level characterization of the quarter.

Let me start with a high-level characterization of the quarter. Q2 was marked by stellar subscriber performance and solid financial results, reflecting another really strong quarter in Business Services, healthy top line growth in Residential Services, largely offset by investments to drive future growth and an expected decline in ad sales in an unpolitical year. Overall, I'm pleased with the results and believe we're positioning ourselves well for a strong performance in 2016. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q2 highlights, starting with customer relationships where we once again performed exceptionally well. We gained 66,000 residential customer relationships in Q2, making this the best second quarter ever. The Q2 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, coupled with a 3% improvement in disconnects. The 3 key sales channels, inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, all performed significantly better than a year ago. Connect activity was strong in all geographic regions. As in Q1, CR net adds were particularly strong in the Pac West, of which the Los Angeles metro area is the largest component, followed by Texas and Midwest. Second quarter churn improvements were driven by improvements in both voluntary and nonpaid disconnects. 
PSU performance in Q2 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 379,000 were 385,000 better than last year's Q2 and even better year-over-year performance than in this year's incredibly strong first quarter. The PSU growth was again driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 233,000 were the best for a second quarter ever. Triple play connects more than doubled year-over-year, and Triple Plays now contribute half of residential's monthly recurring revenue. 
Seasonal headwinds drove a Q2 net decline of 45,000 residential video customers, but notably, that was more than 100,000 better than 1 year ago and the best second quarter performance since 2008. We remain confident that we can achieve positive video net adds for the full year. Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 172,000 were also the best for a second quarter since 2008. Residential phone net adds of 252,000 were the strongest ever for our second quarter. And while we're thrilled with the growth in our subscriber base, we're also very pleased with the quality of the customers we're bringing on. ARPU per new connect is pretty stable, and early life churn is down materially, just one indicator that we're generating higher quality connects. Moreover, 38% of new customer connects in Q2 were triple plays, which tend to churn less in singles and doubles. 
With that, let's move on to our Q2 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.5% year-over-year. We grew residential services revenue by $96 million or 2.1%, matching Q1 for the best organic year-over-year residential revenue growth in the last 4 years. Residential ARPU per customer relationship grew 0.4% to $107.41. Remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects and promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base. So it's just math that our success in driving volume and increasing revenue growth -- is increasing revenue growth but, at the same time, tempering ARPU growth. 
The Mayweather-Pacquiao fight generated around $40 million in revenue, almost 4x the boxing revenue in the year-ago quarter, and drove overall second quarter 2015 pay-per-view revenue higher by $18 million. Business services posted another terrific quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 16.2% year-over-year in Q2. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth of $100 million -- of above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 18.1%, contributing more than half of the business services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 19.5%, and wholesale transport, which was up 23.7%.  And second quarter bookings increased 18% sequentially, making Q2 our best bookings quarter ever. In short, business services is firing on all cylinders, and we're right on track to reach our $5 billion annual revenue goal for business services in 2018. Just as significant, we're continuing to run business services more efficiently. In the second quarter, business services margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year to 59.8%, and business services segment adjusted OIBDA grew 17.4%. Other operations revenue declined 1.1% in Q2. Media sales revenue was down $9 million from last year, primarily due to the $12 million year-over-year cyclical decline in political advertising. Second quarter other revenue increased primarily due to RSN affiliate fees from our residential services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation.

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined 1.2% in Q2, and net of a $27 million increase in pension expense was roughly flat with last year's second quarter. As we've outlined in recent quarters, we're making aggressive investments in a number of areas, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $52 million or 9%. These functions are instrumentally driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand-in-glove with our network reliability improvements and TWC Maxx deployments. Furthermore, we raised sales and marketing expense in the second quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.6%. Roughly 2/3 of the incremental sales and marketing investment was in the Residential segment where we've been raising the staffing levels across all sales channels. For example, we've increased residential direct sales headcount by 33% over the last year. As Bill mentioned, the increased staffing is translating into marked improvements across our sales channels. Similarly, we have continued to hire sales professionals in business services to drive continuing strong revenue growth. Together, these investments are at the core of our efforts to dramatically improve operating performance this year, which we believe will in turn drive significantly stronger financial performance next year.  The biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA continues to be programming and content costs, which grew $148 million or 11% year-over-year. The biggest driver was contractual rate increases of roughly $100 million, followed by an increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees and pay-per-view cost growth of $16 million. In the residential segment, average program and cost per video sub was $42.73, up 4.44 or 11.6% from last year. Excluding the programming cost from the fight, the growth rate was just over 9%. As we noted the last quarter and a couple of times already this morning, pension expense increased $27 million in Q2 and $53 million in the first half of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million, roughly $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates. 
We continue to exercise strong cost discipline in shared functions, which include operating cost associated with broad corporate functions like accounting and finance, IT, executive management, legal and HR. Expenses increased just 2.6% to $739 million in the quarter. As anticipated, adjusted OIBDA for first half is pretty much flat versus last year. Due to the timing of certain expenses, third quarter adjusted OIBDA, excluding pension expense, could be as much as $100 million lower from last year's third quarter. But as Rob indicated, we expect full-year adjusted OIBDA expansion to be down only slightly. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.54, down $0.35 from a year ago. One of the biggest drivers of lower EPS in Q2 was depreciation expense, which again is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to improve the operations and future prospect of the company. Note that Q2 as-reported EPS reflects $120 million gain related to our agency agreement with Verizon Wireless, which is excluded from adjusted EPS. And I'll remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, average shares outstanding were actually up over 3 million year-over-year. This compares to the prior 2 years when shares outstanding were declining. 
CapEx of $1.3 billion in the second quarter was our highest ever, eclipsing the $1.2 billion investment in last year's second quarter. As in recent quarters, this reflects strong subscriber growth, as well as improvements to the plans. Also, our aggressive investments in CPE, as we've continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older less reliable set-tops across the footprint. We also continue to invest in the future growth of business services where we connected 32,000 commercial buildings to our network in the first half of the year. As Rob indicated, we have raised our planned 2015 CapEx to $4.45 billion. Free cash flow is $440 million in the second quarter, down $19 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher capital investments. At the end of Q2, net debt totaled $22.6 billion, down $439 million from year-end 2014. Significantly, the Charter merger agreement permits us to continue paying our $3 per share annual dividend between signing and closing. We just paid our dividend last week and fully expect to continue paying out $0.75 per share each quarter until we close. As I mentioned, we suspended our buyback program in conjunction with our announcement of the Comcast deal, and with the announcement of the Charter transaction, we don't intend to restart it now. 
So to summarize, halfway through our 3-year plan, we're very pleased with our position. Our disciplined execution is paying off a significantly stronger operating metrics. We anticipate that a more intensive investment this year will drive stronger operating financial results in 2016 and beyond.

So we're certainly, in addition to rolling out Maxx, which is having benefits in real time, we're continuing to invest for growth. We're investing residential line extensions, continuing to connect commercial establishments to our network.

They also indicated that they would issue another public notice as soon as they worked through and voted upon the protective order that will govern the treatment of confidential information during the process.

But I think, on a longer-time horizon, your point is well taken, which is that, as we deliver our video product in IP, it enables customers to use any of their customer-owned IP-enabled devices to consume the video product. And that, in time, will result in fewer customers leasing boxes that we have to spend capital on and more bringing their own device. So I do think that, that, in theory, promises to reduce CPE capital, but I do -- but I think that's a multi-year kind of event. And at this point in time, we're anticipating that we're going to continue to provide the best possible equipment for our customers that we deliver. We do offer customers an opportunity to bring their own modems, and I think it's roughly 12% of our base is bringing their own modems, but that means the vast majority of modems is still being purchased by Time Warner Cable. As far as competitiveness in the quarter, I would only say that our connects were up in both FiOS and U-verse markets. And in fact, our connects in U-verse markets were grew -- did better year-over-year than in any other part of the footprint. And on the disconnect side, disconnects were down in both FiOS and U-verse markets, and in fact, we're down most in FiOS markets. So I think the simple characterization of the quarter is that we did well against all competitors, and that gave rise to the really outstanding subscriber results that we reported."

So let's start with usage-based pricing, which we've been implementing for some time for explicit tiers of service. That has, from our perspective, never been about managing over-the-top video consumption or discouraging customers from using other people's video product. It's been 100% about matching price and value. So the goal of usage-based pricing was to offer customers who use less bandwidth, who may be just through e-mail an opportunity to pay less and have an Internet offering that better meets their demands for both usage and price. So it's all about customer segmentation and customer choice. With respect to peering, we have both settlement-free peering relationships and paid peering relationships. And to the extent that there is an exchange of money, either from us or to us in our peering relationships, those are really designed not to generate an independent revenue stream to create another business, but rather to make sure that there's an alignment of interest between us and the counter-party in how efficiently we utilize available capacity. So that's really the way we think about those two areas."

To the extent that customers choose to avail themselves of video over-the-top, it highlights the value of the high-speed data offering that we deliver, we think, better than anybody else. So we think it would be foolish to kind of resist what might otherwise be an attractive behavioral trend. To the extent that we want to make sure that on the video side, we don't lose customers to over-the-top, the way to do that is to compete aggressively and ensure that our video product is the best that's out there, and for what we deliver, I continue to believe that it is the best that's out there. We -- the breadth of content is far better than anything that's delivered over-the-top. Quality of the picture is better, and availability of On-Demand choice is better. So I feel like we can compete on that front, and to the extent we don't, shame on us. As far as the impact that more and more direct-to-consumer offerings have on our ability to sell, well, look, as long as the paying field is even and clustered comparable, I think we'll be able to compete effectively. To the extent that programmers begin to offer, on a direct basis, their offerings at prices, which are either lower than the offer them to us on a wholesale basis at, or in some other way come, on a more attractive packaging basis, in other words, with more flexibility to package the way they want, well, then I think it's going to undercut our ability to sell, and that's going to be a negative for us. But maybe more significantly, it's going to be a negative for the primary distribution channel for all of those video providers. So we'll have to see how it plays out.

So I'm not sure that the recent events yet have filtered into our programming negotiations, so I'd be basing it on theory as opposed to on actual experience. In theory, though, I think it's fair to say that if customers can get programming outside of our video offering, that in a sense diminishes the leverage of the programmers as they negotiate with us, because if we don't have the video product, customers can still get it, and therefore, they don't have to switch from us to some other video provider in order to get that particular programming. So that's the theoretical answer to the question. I think we'll see how it plays out in practice. Give me the second one, sorry?"

It was a very eventful quarter, or should I say, another in a series of very eventful quarters at Time Warner Cable. In the span of a little more than 1 month, we terminated the Comcast merger and entered into a second and even more attractive agreement with Charter. As this is our first earnings call since the Charter announcement, let me start there. As I've said countless times over the last couple of years, we are and have always been committed to maximizing shareholder value. The Charter deal delivers on that commitment. The combination of Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House will create a leading broadband services and technology company, with almost 24 million customers in 41 states. The increased scale of the new company should yield increased investment and greater efficiencies, resulting in better products and service and more competition both for consumers and businesses. The deal terms recognize Time Warner Cable's unique value, and I believe, strike the right balance between value certainty and upside opportunity for our shareholders, and we expect that the new company will continue to employ the vast majority of Time Warner Cable's employees. So in short, this is a really good deal all the way around for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. We're well into the process of seeking regulatory approvals and planning for integration of our operations. Through the drama, uncertainty and press coverage, our team impressively maintained its focus on operations, delivering yet another strong quarter. To the Time Warner Cable team, I want to extend my sincere thanks for continuing to exceed my lofty expectations. 
Our second quarter results are the latest in a 6-quarter trend of significant and dramatic operational improvement. We added 66,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive second quarter net additions since 2008 and our best second quarter ever. We added 233,000 triples and more than 0.25 million voice subs, both records for our second quarter, and posted our best video and broadband second quarter in years.  Recall that when we disclosed our 3-year operating plan 18 months ago, I said that we would add 1 million residential customer relationships over the course of the plan. At the time, we made it clear that it was a back-end loaded plan, and I think most of you probably thought it was a pretty ambitious target. While halfway through the plan period, we've added 421,000 residential CRs, which puts us well ahead of schedule. And our subscriber momentum has continued into July, which adds to my confidence that we'll hit or exceed the 1 million customer bogey. 
As for our financial performance in the quarter, top line growth was solid at 3.5%, driven by another quarter of exceptionally strong growth in business services as well as organic residential growth, which matched Q1 as the best in the last 4 years. As in Q1, we continued to prioritize improving the customer experience, both through investment in the capability and reliability of our network and customer premises equipment, and by spending to enhance sales, technical operations and customer care. As a consequence, Q2 adjusted OIBDA, excluding pension expense, was essentially flat. The investments we're making are already yielding results. We completed the TWC Maxx deployment in Austin, and we're on track to complete Maxx rollout in Dallas, San Antonio, Raleigh, Charlotte, Kansas City and Hawaii by year-end. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we'll start the Maxx process in San Diego this year, and finish it up early next year, and we've now decided to accelerate into this year the start of the Maxx rollout in Wilmington and Greensboro, North Carolina. 
TWC Maxx is all about transforming the Time Warner Cable experience, and it's clearly working. In TWC Maxx cities, customer satisfaction is up and churn is down. In fact, in Q2, in areas with TWC Maxx, we saw a more than 35% reduction in voluntary disconnects for both video and broadband. We continue to post improvements in key customer service metrics. In Q2, repair calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 4% and 15%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading 1-hour appointment windows was 98%, an all-time record, and our first visit problem resolution rate also hit a new high. Consistent with these statistical achievements, customer satisfaction scores for both tech ops and care are meaningfully higher than a year ago. 
I told you last quarter how critical it was that during the pendency of the Comcast merger, we continued to make investments and run the business as if we were going to run it forever. That approach has certainly paid off, and we have no intention of changing course now that we've agreed to merge with Charter. We're a much healthier company now than we were 24 months ago, and we plan to use the time between signing and closing of the Charter deal to further strengthen our operations. 
In the interest of maintaining continuity and stability, we've put the brakes on some cost-cutting measures that just don't make sense in light of the merger. But otherwise, we're going to stick to our game plan for running the company on a stand-alone basis. If anything, we plan to do more rather than less investing this year to set us up well for next year and beyond. As a result of that increased investment and the fact that it doesn't look like we'll get an additional distribution of the Dodgers network this season, we now expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex pension costs to be down slightly, and by down slightly, I mean, something less than 1%. We also expect that full year CapEx will be around $4.45 billion, somewhat higher than our previous estimate, as we accelerate the TWC Maxx rollout and continue to upgrade and modernize our network and equipment. This is all part of our overall plan to drive meaningful operating and financial growth in 2016. 
So to sum it up, I'm exceptionally pleased with the deal we were able to strike with Charter, and we're working diligently to bring that deal to closure. At the same time, we're continuing to drive our standalone business forward, and our Q2 results are a clear indication that the plan is working. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and Matt Siegel, our acting co-CFOs, who will tag-team the review of our Q2 results. So for those of you who don't know them, Bill has been Time Warner Cable's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since 2008, and Matt has served as our Treasurer also since 2008. They're proven leaders with impressive track records and many years of experience in the industry and with the company, and I have great confidence that they'll do a terrific job leading our finance team. Per the usual process, after Bill and then Matt comments on the quarter, the three of us, along with Dinni, will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

Let me start with a high-level characterization of the quarter.

Let me start with a high-level characterization of the quarter. Q2 was marked by stellar subscriber performance and solid financial results, reflecting another really strong quarter in Business Services, healthy top line growth in Residential Services, largely offset by investments to drive future growth and an expected decline in ad sales in a nonpolitical year. Overall, I'm pleased with the results and believe we're positioning ourselves well for a strong performance in 2016. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q2 highlights, starting with customer relationships where we once again performed exceptionally well. We gained 66,000 residential customer relationships in Q2, making this the best second quarter ever. The Q2 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, coupled with a 3% improvement in disconnects. The 3 key sales channels, inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, all performed significantly better than a year ago. Connect activity was strong in all geographic regions. As in Q1, CR net adds were particularly strong in the Pac West, of which Los Angeles metro area is the largest component, followed by Texas and Midwest. Second quarter churn improvements were driven by improvements in both voluntary and nonpaid disconnects. 
PSU performance in Q2 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds of 379,000 were 385,000 better than last year's Q2 and even better year-over-year performance than in this year's incredibly strong first quarter. The PSU growth was again driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 233,000 were the best for a second quarter ever. Triple play connects more than doubled year-over-year, and triple plays now contribute half of residential's monthly recurring revenue. 
Seasonal headwinds drove a Q2 net decline of 45,000 residential video customers, but notably, that was more than 100,000 better than 1 year ago and the best second quarter performance since 2008. We remain confident that we can achieve positive video net adds for the full year. Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 172,000 were also the best for a second quarter since 2008. Residential phone net adds of 252,000 were the strongest ever for our second quarter. And while we're thrilled with the growth in our subscriber base, we're also very pleased with the quality of the customers we're bringing on. ARPU per new connect is pretty stable, and early life churn is down materially, just one indicator that we're generating higher quality connects. Moreover, 38% of new customer connects in Q2 were triple plays, which tend to churn less than singles and doubles. 
With that, let's move on to our Q2 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.5% year-over-year. We grew residential services revenue by $96 million or 2.1%, matching Q1 for the best organic year-over-year residential revenue growth in the last 4 years. Residential ARPU per customer relationship grew 0.4% to $107.41. Remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects and promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base. So it's just math that our success in driving volume and increasing revenue growth -- is increasing revenue growth but, at the same time, tempering ARPU growth. 
The Mayweather-Pacquiao fight generated around $40 million in revenue, almost 4x the boxing revenue in the year-ago quarter, and drove overall second quarter 2015 pay-per-view revenue higher by $18 million. Business services posted another terrific quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 16.2% year-over-year in Q2. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth of $100 million -- of above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 18.1%, contributing more than half of the business services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 19.5%, and wholesale transport, which was up 23.7%.  And second quarter bookings increased 18% sequentially, making Q2 our best bookings quarter ever. In short, business services is firing on all cylinders, and we're right on track to reach our $5 billion annual revenue goal for business services in 2018. Just as significant, we're continuing to run business services more efficiently. In the second quarter, business services margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year to 59.8%, and business services segment adjusted OIBDA grew 17.4%. Other operations revenue declined 1.1% in Q2. Media sales revenue was down $9 million from last year, primarily due to the $12 million year-over-year cyclical decline in political advertising. Second quarter other revenue increased primarily due to RSN affiliate fees from our residential services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. 
Next, Matt will cover expenses, cash flow and the balance sheet. Matt?"

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined 1.2% in Q2, and net of a $27 million increase in pension expense was roughly flat with last year's second quarter. As we've outlined in recent quarters, we're making aggressive investments in a number of areas, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $52 million or 9%. These functions are instrumental in driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand-in-glove with our network reliability improvements and TWC Maxx deployments. Furthermore, we raised sales and marketing expense in the second quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.6%. Roughly 2/3 of the incremental sales and marketing investment was in the Residential segment where we've been raising the staffing levels across all sales channels. For example, we've increased residential direct sales headcount by 33% over the last year. As Bill mentioned, the increased staffing is translating into marked improvements across our sales channels. Similarly, we have continued to hire sales professionals in business services to drive continuing strong revenue growth. Together, these investments are at the core of our efforts to dramatically improve operating performance this year, which we believe will in turn drive significantly stronger financial performance next year.  The biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA continues to be programming and content costs, which grew $148 million or 11% year-over-year. The biggest driver was contractual rate increases of roughly $100 million, followed by an increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees and pay-per-view cost growth of $16 million. In the residential segment, average program and cost per video sub was $42.73, up $4.44 or 11.6% from last year. Excluding the programming cost from the fight, the growth rate was just over 9%. As we noted last quarter and a couple of times already this morning, pension expense increased $27 million in Q2 and $53 million in the first half of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million, a roughly $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates. 
We continue to exercise strong cost discipline in our shared functions, which include operating cost associated with broad corporate functions like accounting and finance, IT, executive management, legal and HR. Expenses increased just 2.6% to $739 million in the quarter. As anticipated, adjusted OIBDA for first half is pretty much flat versus last year. Due to the timing of certain expenses, third quarter adjusted OIBDA, excluding pension expense, could be as much as $100 million lower from last year's third quarter. But as Rob indicated, we expect full-year adjusted OIBDA ex pension to be down only slightly. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.54, down $0.35 from a year ago. One of the biggest drivers of lower EPS in Q2 was depreciation expense, which again is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to improve the operations and future prospects of the company. Note that Q2 as-reported EPS reflects $120 million gain related to our agency agreement with Verizon Wireless, which is excluded from adjusted EPS. And I'd remind you that with the suspension of our share repurchase program when we announced the Comcast transaction, average shares outstanding were actually up over 3 million year-over-year. This compares to the prior 2 years when shares outstanding were declining. 
CapEx of $1.3 billion in the second quarter was our highest ever, eclipsing the $1.2 billion investment in last year's second quarter. As in recent quarters, this reflects strong subscriber growth, as well as improvements to the plans. Also, our aggressive investments in CPE, as we've continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems in Maxx markets, and our accelerated replacement of older, less reliable set-tops across the footprint. We also continue to invest in the future growth of business services where we connected 32,000 commercial buildings to our network in the first half of the year. As Rob indicated, we have raised our planned 2015 CapEx to $4.45 billion. Free cash flow is $440 million in the second quarter, down $19 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher capital investments. At the end of Q2, net debt totaled $22.6 billion, down $439 million from year-end 2014. Significantly, the Charter merger agreement permits us to continue paying our $3 per share annual dividend between signing and closing. We just paid our dividend last week and fully expect to continue paying out $0.75 per share each quarter until we close. As I mentioned, we suspended our buyback program in conjunction with our announcement of the Comcast deal, and with the announcement of the Charter transaction, we don't intend to restart it now. 
So to summarize, halfway through our 3-year plan, we're very pleased with our position. Our disciplined execution is paying off in significantly stronger operating metrics. We anticipate that our more intensive investment this year will drive stronger operating and financial results in 2016 and beyond.

I think until we're complete on the rollout of TWC Maxx and until we've retired all of sort of what I would refer to as last-generation consumer premises equipment, I would expect that CapEx is going to continue at a somewhat elevated rate. But I think, on a longer-time horizon, your point is well taken, which is that, as we deliver our video product in IP, it enables customers to use any of their customer-owned IP-enabled devices to consume the video product. And that, in time, will result in fewer customers leasing boxes that we have to spend capital on and more bringing their own device. So I do think that, that, in theory, promises to reduce CPE capital, but I do -- but I think that's a multi-year kind of event. And at this point in time, we're anticipating that we're going to continue to provide the best possible equipment for our customers that we deliver. We do offer customers an opportunity to bring their own modems, and I think it's roughly 12% of our base is bringing their own modems, but that means the vast majority of modems is still being purchased by Time Warner Cable. As far as competitiveness in the quarter, I would only say that our connects were up in both FiOS and U-verse markets. And in fact, our connects in U-verse markets were -- grew -- did better year-over-year than in any other part of the footprint. And on the disconnect side, disconnects were down in both FiOS and U-verse markets, and in fact, were down most in FiOS markets.

That has, from our perspective, never been about managing over-the-top video consumption or discouraging customers from using other people's video product.

So the goal of usage-based pricing was to offer customers who use less bandwidth, who may be just through e-mail an opportunity to pay less and have an Internet offering that better meets their demands for both usage and price. So it's all about customer segmentation and customer choice. With respect to peering, we have both settlement-free peering relationships and paid peering relationships. And to the extent that there is an exchange of money, either from us or to us in our peering relationships, those are really designed not to generate an independent revenue stream to create another business, but rather to make sure that there's an alignment of interest between us and the counter-party in how efficiently we utilize available capacity.

To the extent that customers choose to avail themselves of video over-the-top, it highlights the value of the high-speed data offering that we deliver, we think, better than anybody else. So we think it would be foolish to kind of resist what might otherwise be an attractive behavioral trend. To the extent that we want to make sure that on the video side, we don't lose customers to over-the-top, the way to do that is to compete aggressively and ensure that our video product is the best that's out there, and for what we deliver, I continue to believe that it is the best that's out there. We -- the breadth of content is far better than anything that's delivered over-the-top. Quality of the picture is better, and availability of On-Demand choice is better. So I feel like we can compete on that front, and to the extent we don't, shame on us. As far as the impact that more and more direct-to-consumer offerings have on our ability to sell, well, look, as long as the paying field is even and costs are comparable, I think we'll be able to compete effectively. To the extent that programmers begin to offer, on a direct basis, their offerings at prices which are either lower than they offer them to us on a wholesale basis at, or in some other way on a more attractive packaging basis, in other words, with more flexibility to package the way they want, well, then I think it's going to undercut our ability to sell, and that's going to be a negative for us. But maybe more significantly, it's going to be a negative for the primary distribution channel for all of those video providers. So we'll have to see how it plays out. I think we all have to proceed with full -- with our eyes wide open as to what the impact might be."

Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue growth accelerated, and we continue to make significant investments in our network, equipment, products and customer service. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish amid a prolonged period of merger-related activity. It's really a testament to our well thought out operating plan and the commitment and the focus of our entire team, all 55,000 employees who work tirelessly everyday to make Time Warner Cable an even better company. 
Bill will cover our subscriber results in more detail, but I do want to call out a few highlights. This was, without a doubt, our best overall third quarter subscriber performance ever. We added 147,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive third quarter net additions since 2008. 
Both connects and disconnects were better than last year's Q3 and the improvement was broad-based. We added customers in each of our geographic regions and fared well against all competitors. Customer relationship gross adds were up and [indiscernible] was down footprint wide and most notably in those areas served by U-verse and FiOS. 
Over the last 7 quarters, we've added roughly 572,000 residential customers against our 3-year goal of adding 1 million CRs. That's a 4% increase in our subbase and well ahead of our original plan. 
Despite all the talk about contraction in the broader multichannel video marketplace, our video performance was really good. We launched just 7,000 residential video subs in the quarter, the best third quarter result since 2006. 
And through the end of last week, we're within just 9,000 residential video subs of our goal of posting positive video subs for the full year.  Regardless of exactly where we land, this is an incredible turnaround from 2 years ago. 
I'm pleased with our financial performance as well. Top line growth was 3.6% with a more balanced contribution from Residential and Business services. 
Residential revenue increased 2.6%, the best organic third quarter growth since 2010. Business services turned in yet another quarter of more than $100 million of year-over-year revenue growth. 
Total company adjusted OIBDA, while down year-over-year, came in a bit better than anticipated. 
Consistent with our prior guidance, we still expect full year adjusted OIBDA extension expense to be down less than 1% year-over-year. 
We continue to be single-mindedly focused on improving the customer experience. In Q3, we, again, delivered improvements in key customer service metrics. Care fulls and repair related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 11% and 16%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading one hour appointment windows was 98%, and we work declined by 11%. 
As you may have noticed, we started to highlight some of these customer service improvements in our advertising. We're the first to acknowledge that we've got a long way to go, but the strides we're making are significant, and incredibly proud of what the team has been able to accomplish. 
We also continued the aggressive rollout of TWC Maxx, including deployments of all-digital video and Internet speeds of up to 300 megabits per second. 
We completed TWC Maxx in Kansas City in August and in Dallas earlier this month. Deployments are progressing well in Raleigh, Charlotte, Wilmington, Greensboro, San Antonio and Hawaii. 
In addition, we'll start the San Diego rollout in the next several weeks. 
In addition to Maxx, we continue to invest in our network and equipment across our entire footprint to enhance reliability and the overall customer experience. 
In the first 9 months of the year, we've deployed 2 million new setups, all of which run our cloud-based guide, 3.1 million high-definition digital adapters and over 3 million event wireless gateways. 
Our investments and reliable and customer service, including TWC Maxx, are starting to bear fruit. Voluntary churn among residential subs is showing very positive trends. 
In non-Maxx markets, we've driven voluntary churn for each of video and broadband, down 15% year-over-year. That's impressive in its own right, but in Maxx markets, voluntary churn is down around twice that. 
We're also seeing improved customer satisfaction across all geographic regions with New York City and Los Angeles, our first 2 Maxx markets, posting the greatest improvements this quarter. 
So to sum it up, we're executing very well and our customers are beginning to recognize the changes. 
In the meantime, the team is working work well with Charter to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our deal and the plan for the integration of our companies. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and then Matt Siegel who will tag team to review of our Q3 results. After they comment on the quarter, the 3 of us, along with Dinni will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

As Rob said, we're performing very well.

Wit",742,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. 
As Rob said, we're performing very well. Our third quarter looked a lot like the quarter that proceeded it did with continuing progress in Residential services and a strong performance in Business Services. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q3 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we, once again, performed exceptionally well. 
We gained 147,000 residential customer relationships in the third quarter, making this the best third quarter ever. The last time we delivered positive CR net adds in the third quarter was back in 2008. 
And in the preceding quarter, the Q3 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, as in preceding quarter, they're driven by 9% increase in connects. 
The 3Q sales channels: Inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, continued to perform significantly better than a year ago. 
Disconnects improved by almost 5% year-over-year, even better than our Q2 performance. Third quarter churn improvement was driven primarily by improvements in voluntary and nonpaid disconnects. 
PSU performance in Q3 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds up 462,000 were more than 0.5 million better than last year's Q3. The PSU growth is driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 218,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2007. 
It's noteworthy that we now have more than 5 million residential triple play customers, that's roughly 1/3 of our customer relationships. 
Third quarter residential video subscriber performance was the best in 9 years. We came within 7,000 subs of breakeven for the quarter, that's 177,000 better than last year and as Rob told you, we're still driving towards positive video net adds for the full year, which will be a major milestone. 
Broadband volume was very strong, residential net adds of 232,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2006. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 700,000 residential broadband customers. 
Residential phone net adds of 237,000 were the strongest for the third quarter in 8 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 800,000 residential phone customers. 
The quality of the residential subscriber base continues to be very solid. ARPU per new connect is up slightly year-over-year and early churn continue to be materially lower than a year earlier, just a couple of indicators that we're generating high-quality connects. 
In similar to Q2, 37% of new customer connects in Q3 were triple place, which tends to churn less in the singles and doubles. 
With that, let's move on to our Q3 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.6% year-on-year. We grew third quarter Residential Services revenue by $120 million or 2.6%, the best organic year-over-year Q3 residential revenue growth since 2010. 
Residential ARPU per customer relationships of $106.42 was roughly flat with last year, with recurring revenue per customer up ahead and nonrecurring revenue down slightly. 
Again, remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects and promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base, so it's just not that our success in driving volume is increasing revenue growth, but at the same time tempering ARPU growth. 
Business services posted another excellent quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 15.5% year-over-year in Q3. This was a 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth above $100 million. 
HSD led the way, up 20.1% and contributing more than half the Business Services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 15.9%, and wholesale transport, which was up 16.2%. 
It's worth noting that Q3 sales generally come in a little lower than Q2 due to the timing of e-rate sales to educational institutions. 
Nonetheless, third quarter bookings of $20 million were just $1 million short of the record set in Q2. 
In summary, Business Services is performing very well, and we're still targeting at least $5 billion in annual revenue in the Business Services area by 2018. Other operations revenue declined 4.8% in Q3. Media sales revenue was down $25 million from last year, primarily due to lower political advertising revenue, which was $5 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million a year earlier. And third quarter other revenue increased primarily to RSN affiliate fees and Residential Services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. 
Next, Matt will cover expenses, cash flow and the balance sheet. Matt?"

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%.

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in 
Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $15 million better than the expectation we set the last quarter. 
Adjusted OIBDA has been temporarily reduced by our proactive strategy initiated in 2014 to increase investment and functions that caused customers, enhance the customer experience and prove our operating liability. 
Through these efforts, we expect we'll be able to connect more customers and we see them longer, which increases their value. 
In their remarks, Rob and Bill highlighted the impressive subscriber results [indiscernible] delivering. I'll cover the financial dimensions of these investments in my comments. 
As in recent quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in the number of areas in Q3, notably picks up and customer care, which together increased $50 million or 8.2%. 
Of course, a significant part of this increase was driven by our success in adding customer relationships. 
If you look at it on a per CR basis, pickups in care grew a little over 5% year-over-year. 
And if you look at it on a per PSU basis, the year-over-year increases is even more modest. 
These functions are instrument in driving better customer experience and investment in these areas go hand-in-hand with our network reliability improvements in TWC Maxx deployments. 
Furthermore, we increased sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter by similar amount, $52 million or 9.4%. 
Unit growth was a big driver here as sales and marketing per CR connect potentially slightly lower than last year's third quarter. 
Program and content cost which increased $135 million, were 10.2% year-over-year continue to be the biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA. 
As in Q2, contractual affiliate fee increases roughly $100 million and contractual increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees were the 2 biggest components of the increase. 
In the Residential segment, average program collect per video sub was $42.43, up $3.47 or 8.9% from last year. 
Pension expense increased $28 million in Q3 and $81 million in the first 9 months of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million or roughly $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates. 
Shared functions costs increased 7.2% to $763 million in the third quarter as a result of higher compensation cost per employee and the lumpiness of certain expense categories, including maintenance and insurance. 
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, adjusted OIBDA ex pension was pretty much flat versus last year. 
We continue to expect full year adjusted OIBDA expansion to be down slightly, being down less than 1 percentage point versus last year. 
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.62, down $0.24 from a year ago. 
Higher depreciation expense, which is clearly a reflection of the large capital investment we're making to accommodate increase subscriber volumes and Internet traffic as well as to improve the operations and future prospects of the company, continued to be a driver of lower EPS. 
Third quarter CapEx of $1.1 billion reflects strong subscriber growth as well as improvements in the plan in aggressive investment CP as we continue to deploy new setups, DTEs and modems. 
We also continue to invest in the future growth of the Business Services where we connected 18,000 commercial buildings in our network in the quarter. 
So the first 9 months of the year, we added 50,000 commercial buildings to our network, representing almost $50 million in serviceable annual opportunity. 
Free cash flow was $441 million in the third quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year, helped by a positive move in working capital. 
At the end of Q3, net debt stood at $22.2 billion, down $801 million from year-end 2014. 
So to summarize, the business is very healthy, and we're making tremendous progress in our transformation. We continue to believe that our subscriber and revenue momentum will transfer into strong financial performance in 2016. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

So when we launched th",627,"Sure, Craig. Let me take it in 2 steps. Let's first talk about the New York beta and then we'll come back to skinny bundles. So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we launched the TWC TV App, which, of course, is our IP TV app, the goal there was to create an offering that was complementary to our traditional video product, to add additional screens on additional IP-enabled devices for customers to consume video. As we move forward and what we're trialing with this beta in New York is we're going to move that TWC TV capability toward a full video offering that, in fact, could be substitutional for the traditional set-top box-based video product. And where we're headed is the ability of customers to access the complete video product without having to rent that e set-top box from us, whether they use the Roku or whether they use ultimately and other IP enabled device. So what we need to accomplish that is first-minute to ensure that our video -- that, that video product complies with Title VI of the Telecom Act in the same way that our traditional video service does, meaning emergency alert service, closed captioning, SAP and all of those things that comply with the law. So we're doing that in the beta. Second thing we've got to do is ensure that we have a complete channel lineup. That TWC TV App already has a very significant channel lineup, but that doesn't include every single paid channel and in some markets there are local channels that aren't yet included, so we need to make sure that, that's in there. And then lastly, we really need to take the quality of the video picture from what I would essentially call an SD picture to an HD picture. So we're going to increase the resolution on those pictures just to deliver a better video experience. And then over time, you'll see us add additional features to the TWC TV App until it is -- from an experienced perspective, indistinguishable from the traditional video product, but with the added benefits of no need to rent the set-top box and a much, much more streamlined provisioning process, no necessity for a truck roll, you can simply type in your username and password, and you have video. So that's what we're trying to accomplish with the beta. Why we chose to offer the full complement of channels, really, is consistent with our strategy on video overall. We want to make sure the customers can have everything they have video the set-top box. That does not mean that we are not ultimately going to get to a place where we offer alternative bundles via that app as well. We're big fans of customer segmentation, we're big fans of giving customers choice, but right now, and we've been very effective at this as you can see in our video numbers this quarter, we've actually tried to simplify our offerings, make them easier to buy for customers and easier to sell for our reps, and that has driven us to kind of simplify our offerings, but does that didn't mean that in the fullness of time, we want push hard on things like basic cable plus a premium or our TV Essentials product, both of which are variations on the theme of skinnier bundles. And the last thing I noticed, again this quarter and this is been true for a couple of quarters now, about 82% of our gross video connects actually took our preferred TV product. So for all the talk about skinny bundles, we're doing pretty well offering a full video product."

First, I think the answer to the second part of your question is both, fewer people attempting to leave and better effectiveness on our retention efforts. In terms of the relationship between the decline in voluntary churn or decline in churn generally and revenue per user, it's kind of a strange dynamic going on. So we talked a lot about the impact of increases in connect volume on ARPU in that the customers were bringing on in greater numbers now generate less revenue per customer that our existing base. So we drive higher revenue, but lower ARPU. On the other side, on the retention side, interestingly, the customers we're losing right now are also lower than the existing base. So ironically, when you lose fewer of them, you actually have a negative impact on ARPU. And these strange dynamics are kind of why I counsel against putting too much emphasis on ARPU and more emphasis on the combination of both rate and volume and what it means for revenue growth."

When we think about returns, we're going to have to figure out a model here that generates a return that is appropriate for the investments we're making, and that may require that we find a way to replicate revenue that currently comes in the form of set-top box rental revenue. But I think this is early days. The reason we're beta-ing, this is to make sure that we understand how to do it technically and in to make sure we understand what the provision experiences for customers and then overall, it's good for them.

We've talked about the fact that new connect revenue per customer is more or less the same year-over-year, and that's reflected of the fact that we've lowered the amount we're receiving for each type of co work, but we're selling a whole lot more triples. And if you're behind that is with think we're delivering a lot more value to our customers. As a result, they're going to be happier customers, and we're going to retain them longer, which in turn, means they have a greater lifetime value to us. So that's the theory of the case there. The revenue lift when we're adding phone is more modest than it has been in the past, probably in the nature of $10 versus 20-some-odd dollars a while ago. You want me to? Okay. I'm going to handle your second question as well, James. I think how we scale in IP video product that replaces our traditional video product is one of the reasons we're trialing. With today's technology, everyone of those IP streams is a unicast, so it's consuming bandwidth just like a VOD stream, so we don't get the benefit of broadcast efficiency. And figuring out how to manage that on our network is part of the reason we're beta-ing this particular offering. That said, we feel fairly confident about the capability of our network to ultimately deliver a video product that is IP delivered, even a unicast IP video product. So that's what we're at."

And I think I might have fallen into this trap as well, but let me made it very clear. Our beta, our IP video offering is not over-the-top. I know it's common to us to equate IP with over-the-top. In fact, this is a video service that we're delivering over our facilities, not over anybody else's. It may -- over time, there may be TV anywhere, component TV Everywhere component to this just like there is 1 to our traditional video offering. But what we're talking about here is a managed video service over our network. So just to get the clarification out of the way. In terms of economics, I think we don't really know, but let me give you some of the puts and takes and I think you've isolated a couple of them. Clearly, the service model may be fundamentally different. The install process will be far less labor-intensive, and that's certainly a good buy in terms of the economics of doing the business. It's certainly a less capital-intensive model in that customers will likely bring their own devices, and that will reduce the CPE capital requirements for us. The same token, at least with today's technology, there may be a greater bandwidth requirement, so that's an offset the other way. And then the care model, I think, really needs to evolve, and we don't yet know how that's going to work, and that's why I'm a little hesitant to declare exactly what the economics are. But I think it's reasonable to assume that this is a model that could turn out to be more interesting, more compelling for us. But more importantly, we think it's going to be a great customer experience and ultimately, that's what's driving our interest in pursuing this thing. In terms of the broadband pricing question, I don't -- I can't give you an outlook on where broadband pricing is going, except to say, we're going to continue to deliver more and more utility of customers and generally speaking, where customers get more value out of your products, they're willing to pay more. But what we actually charge is going to be a function of what the marketplace dictates. It's a very competitive market out there, and we're going to have to continue to price our products in a way that allows us to acquire and retain them. On usage-based pricing concession, as you described it, I'll say, this is -- it's not really appropriate for me to answer the question. Charter as the acquirer made the concession or offered up that they would not use implement usage-based pricing. They don't implement usage-based pricing today, so I think it's a better question for Tom and his team as to what they're thinking was on offering that up."

Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue growth accelerated and we continue to make significant investments in our network, equipment, products and customer service. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish amid a prolonged period of merger-related activity. It's really a testament to our well-thought out operating plan and the commitment and focus of our entire team, all 55,000 employees who work tirelessly everyday to make Time Warner Cable an even better company.
Bill will cover our subscriber results in more detail, but I do want to call out a few highlights. This was, without a doubt, our best overall third quarter subscriber performance ever. We added 147,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive third quarter net additions since 2008.
Both connects and disconnects were better than last year's Q3 and the improvement was broad-based. We added customers in each of our geographic regions and fared well against all competitors. Customer relationship gross adds were up and churn was down footprint-wide and, most notably, in those areas served by U-verse and FiOS.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've added roughly 570,000 residential customers against our 3-year goal of adding 1 million CRs. That's a 4% increase in our subbase and well ahead of our original plan. 
Despite all the talk about a contraction in the broader multichannel video marketplace, our video performance was really good. We lost just 7,000 residential video subs in the quarter, the best third quarter result since 2006. And through the end of last week, we're within just 9,000 residential video subs of our goal of posting positive video subs for the full year.  Regardless of exactly where we land, this is an incredible turnaround from 2 years ago.
I'm pleased with our financial performance as well. Top line growth was 3.6% with a more balanced contribution from Residential and Business Services. Residential revenue increased 2.6%, the best organic third quarter growth since 2010. Businesses -- Business Services turned in yet another quarter of more than $100 million of year-over-year revenue growth.
Total company adjusted OIBDA, while down year-over-year, came in a bit better than we anticipated. Consistent with our prior guidance, we still expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension expense to be down less than 1% year-over-year.
We continue to be single-mindedly focused on improving the customer experience. In Q3, we, again, delivered improvements in key customer service metrics. Care calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 11% and 16%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading one hour appointment windows was 98%, and rework declined by 11%.
As you may have noticed, we've started to highlight some of these customer service improvements in our advertising. We're the first to acknowledge that we've got a long way to go, but the strides we're making are significant, and I'm incredibly proud of what the team has been able to accomplish.
We also continued the aggressive rollout of TWC Maxx, including deployments of all-digital video and Internet speeds of up to 300 megabits per second.
We completed TWC Maxx in Kansas City in August and in Dallas earlier this month. Deployments are progressing well in Raleigh, Charlotte, Wilmington, Greensboro, San Antonio and Hawaii. In addition, we'll start the San Diego rollout in the next several weeks.
In addition to Maxx, we continue to invest in our network and equipment across our entire footprint to enhance reliability and the overall customer experience.
In the first 9 months of the year, we've deployed 2 million new set-tops, all of which run our cloud-based guide, 3.1 million high-definition digital adapters and over 3 million event wireless gateways.
Our investments in reliability and customer service, including TWC Maxx, are starting to bear fruit. Voluntary churn among residential subs is showing very positive trends. In non-Maxx markets, we've driven voluntary churn for each of video and broadband, down 15% year-over-year. That's impressive in its own right. But in Maxx markets, voluntary churn is down around twice that.
We're also seeing improved customer satisfaction across all geographic regions, with New York City and Los Angeles, our first 2 Maxx markets, posting the greatest improvements this quarter.
So to sum it up, we're executing very well and our customers are beginning to recognize the changes. In the meantime, the team is working work well with Charter to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our deal and to plan for the integration of our companies.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and then Matt Siegel who will tag team the review of our Q3 results. After they comment on the quarter, the 3 of us, along with Dinni, will be available for Q&A. Bill?"
862598,312945561,885389,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob said, we're performing very well.

With that",749,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob said, we're performing very well. Our third quarter looked a lot like the quarter that preceded it, with continuing progress in Residential Services and a strong performance in Business Services. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q3 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we, once again, performed exceptionally well.
We gained 147,000 residential customer relationships in the third quarter, making this the best third quarter ever. The last time we delivered positive CR net adds in the third quarter was back in 2008. And in the preceding quarter, the Q3 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, as in the preceding quarter, they were driven by a 9% increase in connects. The 3 key sales channels: Inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, continued to perform significantly better than a year ago. Disconnects improved by almost 5% year-over-year, even better than our Q2 performance. Third quarter churn improvement was driven primarily by improvements in voluntary and nonpaid disconnects.
PSU performance in Q3 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds, up 462,000, were more than 0.5 million better than in last year's Q3. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 218,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2007. It's noteworthy that we now have more than 5 million residential triple play customers. That's roughly 1/3 of our customer relationships.
Third quarter residential video subscriber performance was the best in 9 years. We came within 7,000 subs of breakeven for the quarter. That's 177,000 better than last year. And as Rob told you, we're still driving towards positive video net adds for the full year, which will be a major milestone.
Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 232,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2006. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 700,000 residential broadband customers.
Residential phone net adds of 237,000 were the strongest for a third quarter in 8 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 800,000 residential phone customers.
The quality of the residential subscriber base continues to be very solid. ARPU per new connect is up slightly year-over-year and early life churn continue to be materially lower than a year earlier, just a couple of indicators that we're generating high-quality connects. And similar to Q2, 37% of new customer connects in Q3 were triple plays, which tend to churn less in the singles and doubles.
With that, let's move on to our Q3 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.6% year-over-year. We grew third quarter Residential Services revenue by $120 million or 2.6%, the best organic year-over-year Q3 Residential revenue growth since 2010.
Residential ARPU per customer relationship of $106.42 was roughly flat with last year, with recurring revenue per customer up a tad and nonrecurring revenue down slightly. Again, remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects at promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base, so it's just math that our success in driving volume is increasing revenue growth, but at the same time, tempering ARPU growth.
Business Services posted another excellent quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 15.5% year-over-year in Q3. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 20.1%, and contributing more than half the Business Services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 15.9%, and wholesale transport, which was up 16.2%. It's worth noting that Q3 sales generally come in a little lower than Q2 due to the timing of E-Rate sales to educational institutions. Nonetheless, third quarter bookings of $20 million were just $1 million short of the record set in Q2.
In summary, Business Services is performing very well and we're still targeting at least $5 billion in annual revenue in the Business Services area by 2018.
Other operations revenue declined 4.8% in Q3. Media sales revenue was down $25 million from last year, primarily due to lower political advertising revenue, which was $5 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million a year earlier. And third quarter Other revenue increased primarily due to RSN affiliate fees from Residential Services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. 
Next, Matt will cover expenses, cash flow and the balance sheet. Matt?"

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $15 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.",690,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $15 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA has been temporarily reduced by our proactive strategy initiated in 2014 to increase investment and functions that touched customers, enhance the customer experience and improve our operating reliability. Through these efforts, we expect we'll be able to connect more customers and retain them longer, which increases their value.
In their remarks, Rob and Bill highlighted the impressive subscriber results our investments are already delivering. I'll cover the financial dimensions of these investments in my comments.
As in recent quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in a number of areas in Q3, notably pickups in customer care, which together increased $50 million or 8.2%. Of course, a significant part of this increase was driven by our success in adding customer relationships. If you look at it on a per CR basis, pickups in care grew a little over 5% year-over-year. And if you looked at it on a per PSU basis, the year-over-year increase is even more modest.
These functions are instrumental in driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand in glove with our network reliability improvements and TWC Maxx deployments. 
Furthermore, we increased sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.4%. Unit growth was the big driver here, as sales and marketing per CR connect was actually slightly lower than last year's third quarter.
Programming and content costs, which increased $135 million or 10.2% year-over-year, continue to be the biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA. As in Q2, contractual affiliate fee increases of roughly $100 million and a contractual increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees were the 2 biggest components of the increase.
In the Residential segment, average programming cost per video sub was $42.43, up $3.47 or 8.9% from last year.
Pension expense increased $28 million in Q3 and $81 million in the first 9 months of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million or roughly a $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates.
Shared functions costs increased 7.2% to $763 million in the third quarter as a result of higher compensation cost per employee and the lumpiness of certain expense categories, including maintenance and insurance.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, adjusted OIBDA ex-pension was pretty much flat versus last year. We continue to expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension to be down slightly, being down less than a percentage point versus last year.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.62, down $0.24 from a year ago. Higher depreciation expense, which is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to accommodate increased subscriber volumes and Internet traffic as well as to improve the operations and future prospects of the company, continued to be a driver of lower EPS.
Third quarter CapEx of $1.1 billion reflects strong subscriber growth as well as improvements at the plant and our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems.
We also continue to invest in future growth of Business Services, where we connected 18,000 commercial buildings to our network in the quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, we added 50,000 commercial buildings to our network, representing almost $50 million in serviceable annual opportunity.
Free cash flow was $441 million in the third quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year, helped by a positive move in working capital.
At the end of Q3, net debt stood at $22.2 billion, down $801 million from year-end 2014.
So to summarize, the business is very healthy and we're making tremendous progress on our transformation. We continue to believe that our subscriber and revenue momentum will transfer into strong financial performance in 2016.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

Let's first talk about the New York City beta, and then we'll come back to skinny bundles.So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we laun",624,"Sure, Craig. Let me take it in 2 steps. Let's first talk about the New York City beta, and then we'll come back to skinny bundles.
So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we launched the TWC TV App, which, of course, is the -- is our IPTV app, the goal there was to create an offering that was complementary to our traditional video product, to add additional screens on additional IP-enabled devices for customers to consume video.
As we move forward and what we're trialing with this beta in New York is we're going to move that TWC TV capability toward a full video offering that, in fact, could be substitutional for the traditional set-top box-based video product. And where we're headed is the ability of customers to access the complete video product without having to rent the set-top box from us, whether they use a Roku or they use ultimately another IP-enabled device.
So what we need to accomplish that is, first, we need to ensure that our video -- that, that video product complies with Title VI of the Telecom Act in the same way that our traditional video service does, meaning emergency alert service, closed captioning, SAP and all of those things that comply with the law. So we're doing that in the beta. 
Second thing we've got to do is ensure that we have a complete channel lineup. The TWC TV App already has a very significant channel lineup, but it doesn't include every single PEG channel and, in some markets, there are local channels that aren't yet included, so we need to make sure that, that's in there. 
And then, lastly, we really need to take the quality of the video picture from what I would essentially call an SD picture to an HD picture. So we're going to increase the resolution on those pictures to just deliver a better video experience.
And then, over time, you'll see us add additional features to the TWC TV App until it is, from an experience perspective, indistinguishable from the traditional video product, but with the added benefits of no need to rent the set-top box and a much, much more streamlined provisioning process, no necessity for a truck roll, you can simply type in your username and password, and you have video. So that's what we're trying to accomplish with the beta.
Why we chose to offer the full complement of channels really is consistent with our strategy on video overall. We want to make sure the customers can have everything they have via the set-top box. That does not mean that we're not ultimately going to get to a place where we offer alternative bundles via that app as well. We're big fans of customer segmentation. We're big fans of giving customers choice. But right now, and we've been very effective at this as you can see in our video numbers this quarter, we've actually tried to simplify our offerings, make them easier to buy for customers and easier to sell for our reps, and that has driven us to kind of simplify our offerings. But does not mean, in the fullness of time, we won't push hard on things like basic cable plus a premium or our TV Essentials product, both of which are variations on the theme of skinnier bundles.
And the last thing I've noticed again this quarter, and this has been true for a couple of quarters now, about 82% of our gross video connects actually took our preferred TV product. So for all the talk about skinny bundles, we're doing pretty well offering a full video product."

I think in the past, in one occasion, the value of the going in bundle was so high that when the prices rolled, the differential was just way too high. That's not the case this time. So we feel really good about what's going to happen. And the very earliest customers that we put on in the triple play bundle last year has started to roll, and our experience with those customers has been very positive so far."

Phil, it's Rob. I'll try that. First, I think the answer to the second part of your question is both, fewer people attempting to leave and better effectiveness on our retention efforts.
In terms of the relationship between the decline in voluntary churn or decline in churn generally and revenue per user, it's kind of a strange dynamic going on. So we talked a lot about the impact of increases in connect volume on ARPU in that the customers were bringing on in greater numbers now generate less revenue per customer than our existing base. So we drive higher revenue, but lower ARPU.
On the other side, on the retention side, interestingly, the customers we're losing right now are also lower than the existing base. So ironically, when you lose fewer of them, you actually have a negative impact on ARPU. And these strange dynamics are kind of why I counsel against putting too much emphasis on ARPU and more emphasis on the combination of both rate and volume and what it means for revenue growth."

For our part, we are aggressively pursuing the enterprise space and, in fact, making decent headway on our own.

So we're not necessarily thinking about it as a product that is designed for a particular segment, although admittedly, it may expand the universe of potential customers by bringing in those types of customers that have been averse to having a set-top box in their family room.
When we think about returns, we're going to have to figure out a model here that generates a return that is appropriate for the investments we're making, and that may require that we find a way to replicate revenue that currently comes in the form of set-top box rental revenue.
But I think this is early days. The reason we're beta-ing this is to make sure that we understand how to do it technically and to make sure we understand what the provisioning experiences for customers and then, overall, it's good for them.
If the product is attractive to customers, I'm fairly confident we're going to figure out a way to generate adequate returns."

Clearly, if the marketplace evolves in such a way that, that's an offering that our competitors deliver, then I think we may need to revisit it.

So if there's one thing I've learned over the last couple of years is that I'm not terribly good at predicting when regulators are going to act on our deals. So I'm not going to give you a projected closing date.
What I will say is that we are working very well with Charter and with Bright House to ensure that everything we can do to put the regulators in a position to act on our deal expeditiously, we're doing. So we responded to all of the RFIs put out by the FCC. We've responded to the DOJ second request. We're making very good strides at the states and local franchise levels. In fact, most of the states that we need to approve the deal have approved and most of the local franchises that need to approve the deal have approved. So we're making good headway there.
I think you're well aware of the FCC's comment schedule. Comments were due last week. The responses to those comments are due next week. And then, about 10 days after that, replies to those responses are due. So that kind of will enable the FCC to have a complete record. And my hope is then we'll begin to engage in earnest thereafter.

We've talked about the fact that new connect revenue per customer is more or less the same year-over-year, and that's reflective of the fact that we've lowered the amount we're receiving for each type of cohort, but we're selling a whole lot more triples. And the theory behind that is we think we're delivering a lot more value to our customers. As a result, they're going to be happier customers and we're going to retain them longer, which, in turn, means they have a greater lifetime value to us. So that's the theory of the case there.
The revenue lift when we are adding phone is more modest than it has been in the past, probably in the nature of $10 versus 20-some-odd dollars a while ago. 
You want me to? Okay. I'm going to handle your second question as well, James. I think how we scale an IP video product that replaces our traditional video product is one of the reasons we're trialing. There's in -- with today's technology, everyone of those IP streams is a unicast, so it's consuming bandwidth just like a VOD stream, so we don't get the benefit of broadcast efficiency. And figuring out how to manage that on our network is part of the reason why we're beta-ing this particular offering. That said, we feel fairly confident about the capability of our network to ultimately deliver a video product that is IP delivered, even a unicast IP video product. So that's what we're at."

And I think I might have fallen into this trap as well, but let me make it very clear. Our beta, our IP video offering is not over-the-top. I know it's common to us to equate IP with over-the-top. In fact, this is a video service that we are delivering over our facilities, not over anybody else's. It may -- over time, there may be a TV anywhere component -- TV Everywhere component to this just like there is one to our traditional video offering, but what we're talking about here is a managed video service over our network. So just get -- to get that clarification out of the way.
In terms of economics, I think we don't really know, but let me give you some of the puts and takes, and I think you have isolated a couple of them. Clearly, the service model may be fundamentally different. The install process will be far less labor-intensive, and that's certainly a good buy in terms of the economics of doing the business. It's certainly a less capital-intensive model in that customers will likely bring their own devices, and that will reduce the CPE capital requirements for us. At the same token, at least with today's technology, there may be a greater bandwidth requirement, so that's an offset the other way. And then, the care model I think really needs to evolve. And we don't yet know how that's going to work, and that's why I'm a little hesitant to declare exactly what the economics are. But I think it's reasonable to assume that this is a model that could turn out to be more interesting, more compelling for us. But more importantly, we think it's going to be a great customer experience. And ultimately, that's what's driving our interest in pursuing this thing.
In terms of the broadband pricing question, I don't -- I can't give you an outlook on where broadband pricing is going, except to say we're going to continue to deliver more and more utility to customers and, generally speaking, where customers get more value out of your products, they're willing to pay more. But what we actually charge is going to be a function of what the marketplace dictates. It's a very competitive market out there, and we're going to have to continue to price our products in a way that allows us to acquire and retain them.
On usage-based pricing concession, as you described it, I'll say, this is -- it's not really appropriate for me to answer the question. Charter, as the acquirer, made the concession or offered up that they would not use -- implement usage-based pricing. They don't implement usage-based pricing today. So I think it's a better question for Tom and his team as to what they're thinking was on offering that up."

I'm extremely excited about the operating momentum reflected in our third quarter results. Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue grow",811,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely excited about the operating momentum reflected in our third quarter results. Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue growth accelerated and we continue to make significant investments in our network, equipment, products and customer service. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish amid a prolonged period of merger-related activity. It's really a testament to our well-thought out operating plan and the commitment and focus of our entire team, all 55,000 employees who work tirelessly everyday to make Time Warner Cable an even better company.
Bill will cover our subscriber results in more detail, but I do want to call out a few highlights. This was, without a doubt, our best overall third quarter subscriber performance ever. We added 147,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive third quarter net additions since 2008.
Both connects and disconnects were better than last year's Q3 and the improvement was broad-based. We added customers in each of our geographic regions and fared well against all competitors. Customer relationship gross adds were up and churn was down footprint-wide and, most notably, in those areas served by U-verse and FiOS.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've added roughly 570,000 residential customers against our 3-year goal of adding 1 million CRs. That's a 4% increase in our subbase and well ahead of our original plan. 
Despite all the talk about a contraction in the broader multichannel video marketplace, our video performance was really good. We lost just 7,000 residential video subs in the quarter, the best third quarter result since 2006. And through the end of last week, we're within just 9,000 residential video subs of our goal of posting positive video subs for the full year.  Regardless of exactly where we land, this is an incredible turnaround from 2 years ago.
I'm pleased with our financial performance as well. Top line growth was 3.6% with a more balanced contribution from Residential and Business Services. Residential revenue increased 2.6%, the best organic third quarter growth since 2010. Businesses -- Business Services turned in yet another quarter of more than $100 million of year-over-year revenue growth.
Total company adjusted OIBDA, while down year-over-year, came in a bit better than we anticipated. Consistent with our prior guidance, we still expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension expense to be down less than 1% year-over-year.
We continue to be single-mindedly focused on improving the customer experience. In Q3, we, again, delivered improvements in key customer service metrics. Care calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 11% and 16%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading one hour appointment windows was 98%, and rework declined by 11%.
As you may have noticed, we've started to highlight some of these customer service improvements in our advertising. We're the first to acknowledge that we've got a long way to go, but the strides we're making are significant, and I'm incredibly proud of what the team has been able to accomplish.
We also continued the aggressive rollout of TWC Maxx, including deployments of all-digital video and Internet speeds of up to 300 megabits per second.
We completed TWC Maxx in Kansas City in August and in Dallas earlier this month. Deployments are progressing well in Raleigh, Charlotte, Wilmington, Greensboro, San Antonio and Hawaii. In addition, we'll start the San Diego rollout in the next several weeks.
In addition to Maxx, we continue to invest in our network and equipment across our entire footprint to enhance reliability and the overall customer experience.
In the first 9 months of the year, we've deployed 2 million new set-tops, all of which run our cloud-based guide, 3.1 million high-definition digital adapters and over 3 million event wireless gateways.
Our investments in reliability and customer service, including TWC Maxx, are starting to bear fruit. Voluntary churn among residential subs is showing very positive trends. In non-Maxx markets, we've driven voluntary churn for each of video and broadband, down 15% year-over-year. That's impressive in its own right. But in Maxx markets, voluntary churn is down around twice that.
We're also seeing improved customer satisfaction across all geographic regions, with New York City and Los Angeles, our first 2 Maxx markets, posting the greatest improvements this quarter.
So to sum it up, we're executing very well and our customers are beginning to recognize the changes. In the meantime, the team is working work well with Charter to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our deal and to plan for the integration of our companies.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and then Matt Siegel who will tag team the review of our Q3 results. After they comment on the quarter, the 3 of us, along with Dinni, will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

As Rob said, we're performing very well.

With that",749,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob said, we're performing very well. Our third quarter looked a lot like the quarter that preceded it, with continuing progress in Residential Services and a strong performance in Business Services. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q3 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we, once again, performed exceptionally well.
We gained 147,000 residential customer relationships in the third quarter, making this the best third quarter ever. The last time we delivered positive CR net adds in the third quarter was back in 2008. And in the preceding quarter, the Q3 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, as in the preceding quarter, they were driven by a 9% increase in connects. The 3 key sales channels: Inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, continued to perform significantly better than a year ago. Disconnects improved by almost 5% year-over-year, even better than our Q2 performance. Third quarter churn improvement was driven primarily by improvements in voluntary and nonpaid disconnects.
PSU performance in Q3 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds, up 462,000, were more than 0.5 million better than in last year's Q3. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 218,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2007. It's noteworthy that we now have more than 5 million residential triple play customers. That's roughly 1/3 of our customer relationships.
Third quarter residential video subscriber performance was the best in 9 years. We came within 7,000 subs of breakeven for the quarter. That's 177,000 better than last year. And as Rob told you, we're still driving towards positive video net adds for the full year, which will be a major milestone.
Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 232,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2006. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 700,000 residential broadband customers.
Residential phone net adds of 237,000 were the strongest for a third quarter in 8 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 800,000 residential phone customers.
The quality of the residential subscriber base continues to be very solid. ARPU per new connect is up slightly year-over-year and early life churn continue to be materially lower than a year earlier, just a couple of indicators that we're generating high-quality connects. And similar to Q2, 37% of new customer connects in Q3 were triple plays, which tend to churn less in the singles and doubles.
With that, let's move on to our Q3 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.6% year-over-year. We grew third quarter Residential Services revenue by $120 million or 2.6%, the best organic year-over-year Q3 Residential revenue growth since 2010.
Residential ARPU per customer relationship of $106.42 was roughly flat with last year, with recurring revenue per customer up a tad and nonrecurring revenue down slightly. Again, remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects at promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base, so it's just math that our success in driving volume is increasing revenue growth, but at the same time, tempering ARPU growth.
Business Services posted another excellent quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 15.5% year-over-year in Q3. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 20.1%, and contributing more than half the Business Services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 15.9%, and wholesale transport, which was up 16.2%. It's worth noting that Q3 sales generally come in a little lower than Q2 due to the timing of E-Rate sales to educational institutions. Nonetheless, third quarter bookings of $20 million were just $1 million short of the record set in Q2.
In summary, Business Services is performing very well and we're still targeting at least $5 billion in annual revenue in the Business Services area by 2018.
Other operations revenue declined 4.8% in Q3. Media sales revenue was down $25 million from last year, primarily due to lower political advertising revenue, which was $5 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million a year earlier. And third quarter Other revenue increased primarily due to RSN affiliate fees from Residential Services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation. 
Next, Matt will cover expenses, cash flow and the balance sheet. Matt?"

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $50 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.",691,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $50 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA has been temporarily reduced by our proactive strategy initiated in 2014 to increase investment and functions that touched customers, enhance the customer experience and improve our operating reliability. Through these efforts, we expect we'll be able to connect more customers and retain them longer, which increases their value.
In their remarks, Rob and Bill highlighted the impressive subscriber results our investments are already delivering. I'll cover the financial dimensions of these investments in my comments.
As in recent quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in a number of areas in Q3, notably pickups in customer care, which together increased $50 million or 8.2%. Of course, a significant part of this increase was driven by our success in adding customer relationships. If you look at it on a per CR basis, pickups in care grew a little over 5% year-over-year. And if you looked at it on a per PSU basis, the year-over-year increase is even more modest.
These functions are instrumental in driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand in glove with our network reliability improvements and TWC Maxx deployments. 
Furthermore, we increased sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.4%. Unit growth was the big driver here, as sales and marketing per CR connect was actually slightly lower than last year's third quarter.
Programming and content costs, which increased $135 million or 10.2% year-over-year, continue to be the biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA. As in Q2, contractual affiliate fee increases of roughly $100 million and a contractual increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees were the 2 biggest components of the increase.
In the Residential segment, average programming cost per video sub was $42.43, up $3.47 or 8.9% from last year.
Pension expense increased $28 million in Q3 and $81 million in the first 9 months of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million or roughly a $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates.
Shared functions costs increased 7.2% to $763 million in the third quarter as a result of higher compensation cost per employee and the lumpiness of certain expense categories, including maintenance and insurance.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, adjusted OIBDA ex-pension was pretty much flat versus last year. We continue to expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension to be down slightly, being down less than a percentage point versus last year.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.62, down $0.24 from a year ago. Higher depreciation expense, which is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to accommodate increased subscriber volumes and Internet traffic as well as to improve the operations and future prospects of the company, continued to be a driver of lower EPS.
Third quarter CapEx of $1.1 billion reflects strong subscriber growth as well as improvements at the plant and our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems.
We also continue to invest in future growth of Business Services, where we connected 18,000 commercial buildings to our network in the quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, we added 50,000 commercial buildings to our network, representing almost $750 [ph] million in serviceable annual opportunity.
Free cash flow was $441 million in the third quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year, helped by a positive move in working capital.
At the end of Q3, net debt stood at $22.2 billion, down $801 million from year-end 2014.
So to summarize, the business is very healthy and we're making tremendous progress on our transformation. We continue to believe that our subscriber and revenue momentum will transfer into strong financial performance in 2016.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

Let's first talk about the New York City beta, and then we'll come back to skinny bundles.So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we laun",624,"Sure, Craig. Let me take it in 2 steps. Let's first talk about the New York City beta, and then we'll come back to skinny bundles.
So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we launched the TWC TV App, which, of course, is the -- is our IPTV app, the goal there was to create an offering that was complementary to our traditional video product, to add additional screens on additional IP-enabled devices for customers to consume video.
As we move forward and what we're trialing with this beta in New York is we're going to move that TWC TV capability toward a full video offering that, in fact, could be substitutional for the traditional set-top box-based video product. And where we're headed is the ability of customers to access the complete video product without having to rent the set-top box from us, whether they use a Roku or they use ultimately another IP-enabled device.
So what we need to accomplish that is, first, we need to ensure that our video -- that, that video product complies with Title VI of the Telecom Act in the same way that our traditional video service does, meaning emergency alert service, closed captioning, SAP and all of those things that comply with the law. So we're doing that in the beta. 
Second thing we've got to do is ensure that we have a complete channel lineup. The TWC TV App already has a very significant channel lineup, but it doesn't include every single PEG channel and, in some markets, there are local channels that aren't yet included, so we need to make sure that, that's in there. 
And then, lastly, we really need to take the quality of the video picture from what I would essentially call an SD picture to an HD picture. So we're going to increase the resolution on those pictures to just deliver a better video experience.
And then, over time, you'll see us add additional features to the TWC TV App until it is, from an experience perspective, indistinguishable from the traditional video product, but with the added benefits of no need to rent the set-top box and a much, much more streamlined provisioning process, no necessity for a truck roll, you can simply type in your username and password, and you have video. So that's what we're trying to accomplish with the beta.
Why we chose to offer the full complement of channels really is consistent with our strategy on video overall. We want to make sure the customers can have everything they have via the set-top box. That does not mean that we're not ultimately going to get to a place where we offer alternative bundles via that app as well. We're big fans of customer segmentation. We're big fans of giving customers choice. But right now, and we've been very effective at this as you can see in our video numbers this quarter, we've actually tried to simplify our offerings, make them easier to buy for customers and easier to sell for our reps, and that has driven us to kind of simplify our offerings. But does not mean, in the fullness of time, we won't push hard on things like basic cable plus a premium or our TV Essentials product, both of which are variations on the theme of skinnier bundles.
And the last thing I've noticed again this quarter, and this has been true for a couple of quarters now, about 82% of our gross video connects actually took our preferred TV product. So for all the talk about skinny bundles, we're doing pretty well offering a full video product."

I think in the past, in one occasion, the value of the going in bundle was so high that when the prices rolled, the differential was just way too high. That's not the case this time. So we feel really good about what's going to happen. And the very earliest customers that we put on in the triple play bundle last year has started to roll, and our experience with those customers has been very positive so far."

Phil, it's Rob. I'll try that. First, I think the answer to the second part of your question is both, fewer people attempting to leave and better effectiveness on our retention efforts.
In terms of the relationship between the decline in voluntary churn or decline in churn generally and revenue per user, it's kind of a strange dynamic going on. So we talked a lot about the impact of increases in connect volume on ARPU in that the customers were bringing on in greater numbers now generate less revenue per customer than our existing base. So we drive higher revenue, but lower ARPU.
On the other side, on the retention side, interestingly, the customers we're losing right now are also lower than the existing base. So ironically, when you lose fewer of them, you actually have a negative impact on ARPU. And these strange dynamics are kind of why I counsel against putting too much emphasis on ARPU and more emphasis on the combination of both rate and volume and what it means for revenue growth."

For our part, we are aggressively pursuing the enterprise space and, in fact, making decent headway on our own.

So we're not necessarily thinking about it as a product that is designed for a particular segment, although admittedly, it may expand the universe of potential customers by bringing in those types of customers that have been averse to having a set-top box in their family room.
When we think about returns, we're going to have to figure out a model here that generates a return that is appropriate for the investments we're making, and that may require that we find a way to replicate revenue that currently comes in the form of set-top box rental revenue.
But I think this is early days. The reason we're beta-ing this is to make sure that we understand how to do it technically and to make sure we understand what the provisioning experiences for customers and then, overall, it's good for them.
If the product is attractive to customers, I'm fairly confident we're going to figure out a way to generate adequate returns."

Clearly, if the marketplace evolves in such a way that, that's an offering that our competitors deliver, then I think we may need to revisit it.

What I will say is that we are working very well with Charter and with Bright House to ensure that everything we can do to put the regulators in a position to act on our deal expeditiously, we're doing. So we responded to all of the RFIs put out by the FCC. We've responded to the DOJ second request. We're making very good strides at the states and local franchise levels. In fact, most of the states that we need to approve the deal have approved and most of the local franchises that need to approve the deal have approved. So we're making good headway there.
I think you're well aware of the FCC's comment schedule. Comments were due last week. The responses to those comments are due next week. And then, about 10 days after that, replies to those responses are due. So that kind of will enable the FCC to have a complete record. And my hope is then we'll begin to engage in earnest thereafter.

We've talked about the fact that new connect revenue per customer is more or less the same year-over-year, and that's reflective of the fact that we've lowered the amount we're receiving for each type of cohort, but we're selling a whole lot more triples. And the theory behind that is we think we're delivering a lot more value to our customers. As a result, they're going to be happier customers and we're going to retain them longer, which, in turn, means they have a greater lifetime value to us. So that's the theory of the case there.
The revenue lift when we are adding phone is more modest than it has been in the past, probably in the nature of $10 versus 20-some-odd dollars a while ago. 
You want me to? Okay. I'm going to handle your second question as well, James. I think how we scale an IP video product that replaces our traditional video product is one of the reasons we're trialing. There's in -- with today's technology, everyone of those IP streams is a unicast, so it's consuming bandwidth just like a VOD stream, so we don't get the benefit of broadcast efficiency. And figuring out how to manage that on our network is part of the reason why we're beta-ing this particular offering. That said, we feel fairly confident about the capability of our network to ultimately deliver a video product that is IP delivered, even a unicast IP video product. So that's what we're at."

And I think I might have fallen into this trap as well, but let me make it very clear. Our beta, our IP video offering is not over-the-top. I know it's common to us to equate IP with over-the-top. In fact, this is a video service that we are delivering over our facilities, not over anybody else's. It may -- over time, there may be a TV anywhere component -- TV Everywhere component to this just like there is one to our traditional video offering, but what we're talking about here is a managed video service over our network. So just get -- to get that clarification out of the way.
In terms of economics, I think we don't really know, but let me give you some of the puts and takes, and I think you have isolated a couple of them. Clearly, the service model may be fundamentally different. The install process will be far less labor-intensive, and that's certainly a good guide [ph] in terms of the economics of doing the business. It's certainly a less capital-intensive model in that customers will likely bring their own devices, and that will reduce the CPE capital requirements for us. At the same token, at least with today's technology, there may be a greater bandwidth requirement, so that's an offset the other way. And then, the care model I think really needs to evolve. And we don't yet know how that's going to work, and that's why I'm a little hesitant to declare exactly what the economics are. But I think it's reasonable to assume that this is a model that could turn out to be more interesting, more compelling for us. But more importantly, we think it's going to be a great customer experience. And ultimately, that's what's driving our interest in pursuing this thing.
In terms of the broadband pricing question, I don't -- I can't give you an outlook on where broadband pricing is going, except to say we're going to continue to deliver more and more utility to customers and, generally speaking, where customers get more value out of your products, they're willing to pay more. But what we actually charge is going to be a function of what the marketplace dictates. It's a very competitive market out there, and we're going to have to continue to price our products in a way that allows us to acquire and retain them.
On usage-based pricing concession, as you described it, I'll say, this is -- it's not really appropriate for me to answer the question. Charter, as the acquirer, made the concession or offered up that they would not use -- implement usage-based pricing. They don't implement usage-based pricing today. So I think it's a better question for Tom and his team as to what they're thinking was on offering that up."

I'm extremely excited about the operating momentum reflected in our third quarter results. Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue grow",812,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely excited about the operating momentum reflected in our third quarter results. Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue growth accelerated and we continue to make significant investments in our network, equipment, products and customer service. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish amid a prolonged period of merger-related activity. It's really a testament to our well-thought out operating plan and the commitment and focus of our entire team, all 55,000 employees who work tirelessly every day to make Time Warner Cable an even better company.
Bill will cover our subscriber results in more detail, but I do want to call out a few highlights. This was, without a doubt, our best overall third quarter subscriber performance ever. We added 147,000 residential customer relationships, the first positive third quarter net additions since 2008.
Both connects and disconnects were better than last year's Q3 and the improvement was broad-based. We added customers in each of our geographic regions and fared well against all competitors. Customer relationship gross adds were up and churn was down footprint-wide and, most notably, in those areas served by U-verse and FiOS.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've added roughly 570,000 residential customers against our 3-year goal of adding 1 million CRs. That's a 4% increase in our subbase and well ahead of our original plan. 
Despite all the talk about a contraction in the broader multichannel video marketplace, our video performance was really good. We lost just 7,000 residential video subs in the quarter, the best third quarter result since 2006. And through the end of last week, we're within just 9,000 residential video subs of our goal of posting positive video subs for the full year. Regardless of exactly where we land, this is an incredible turnaround from 2 years ago.
I'm pleased with our financial performance as well. Top line growth was 3.6% with a more balanced contribution from Residential and Business Services. Residential revenue increased 2.6%, the best organic third quarter growth since 2010. Businesses -- Business Services turned in yet another quarter of more than $100 million of year-over-year revenue growth.
Total company adjusted OIBDA, while down year-over-year, came in a bit better than we anticipated. Consistent with our prior guidance, we still expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension expense to be down less than 1% year-over-year.
We continue to be single-mindedly focused on improving the customer experience. In Q3, we, again, delivered improvements in key customer service metrics. Care calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 11% and 16%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading one hour appointment windows was 98%, and rework declined by 11%.
As you may have noticed, we've started to highlight some of these customer service improvements in our advertising. We're the first to acknowledge that we've got a long way to go, but the strides we're making are significant, and I'm incredibly proud of what the team has been able to accomplish.
We also continued the aggressive rollout of TWC Maxx, including deployments of all-digital video and Internet speeds of up to 300 megabits per second.
We completed TWC Maxx in Kansas City in August and in Dallas earlier this month. Deployments are progressing well in Raleigh, Charlotte, Wilmington, Greensboro, San Antonio and Hawaii. In addition, we'll start the San Diego rollout in the next several weeks.
In addition to Maxx, we continue to invest in our network and equipment across our entire footprint to enhance reliability and the overall customer experience.
In the first 9 months of the year, we've deployed 2 million new set-tops, all of which run our cloud-based guide, 3.1 million high-definition digital adapters and over 3 million event wireless gateways.
Our investments in reliability and customer service, including TWC Maxx, are starting to bear fruit. Voluntary churn among residential subs is showing very positive trends. In non-Maxx markets, we've driven voluntary churn for each of video and broadband, down 15% year-over-year. That's impressive in its own right. But in Maxx markets, voluntary churn is down around twice that.
We're also seeing improved customer satisfaction across all geographic regions, with New York City and Los Angeles, our first 2 Maxx markets, posting the greatest improvements this quarter.
So to sum it up, we're executing very well and our customers are beginning to recognize the changes. In the meantime, the team is working work well with Charter to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our deal and to plan for the integration of our companies.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and then Matt Siegel who will tag team the review of our Q3 results. After they comment on the quarter, the 3 of us, along with Dinni, will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

Our third quarter looked a lot like the quarter that preceded it, with continuing progress in Residential Services and a strong performance in Business Services. With that",749,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob said, we're performing very well. Our third quarter looked a lot like the quarter that preceded it, with continuing progress in Residential Services and a strong performance in Business Services. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q3 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we, once again, performed exceptionally well.
We gained 147,000 residential customer relationships in the third quarter, making this the best third quarter ever. The last time we delivered positive CR net adds in the third quarter was back in 2008. And in the preceding quarter, the Q3 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, as in the preceding quarter, they were driven by a 9% increase in connects. The 3 key sales channels: Inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, continued to perform significantly better than a year ago. Disconnects improved by almost 5% year-over-year, even better than our Q2 performance. Third quarter churn improvement was driven primarily by improvements in voluntary and nonpaid disconnects.
PSU performance in Q3 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds, up 462,000, were more than 0.5 million better than in last year's Q3. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 218,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2007. It's noteworthy that we now have more than 5 million residential triple play customers. That's roughly 1/3 of our customer relationships.
Third quarter residential video subscriber performance was the best in 9 years. We came within 7,000 subs of breakeven for the quarter. That's 177,000 better than last year. And as Rob told you, we're still driving towards positive video net adds for the full year, which will be a major milestone.
Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 232,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2006. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 700,000 residential broadband customers.
Residential phone net adds of 237,000 were the strongest for a third quarter in 8 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 800,000 residential phone customers.
The quality of the residential subscriber base continues to be very solid. ARPU per new connect is up slightly year-over-year and early life churn continue to be materially lower than a year earlier, just a couple of indicators that we're generating high-quality connects. And similar to Q2, 37% of new customer connects in Q3 were triple plays, which tend to churn less in the singles and doubles.
With that, let's move on to our Q3 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.6% year-over-year. We grew third quarter Residential Services revenue by $120 million or 2.6%, the best organic year-over-year Q3 Residential revenue growth since 2010.
Residential ARPU per customer relationship of $106.42 was roughly flat with last year, with recurring revenue per customer up a tad and nonrecurring revenue down slightly. Again, remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects at promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base, so it's just math that our success in driving volume is increasing revenue growth, but at the same time, tempering ARPU growth.
Business Services posted another excellent quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 15.5% year-over-year in Q3. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 20.1%, and contributing more than half the Business Services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 15.9%, and wholesale transport, which was up 16.2%. It's worth noting that Q3 sales generally come in a little lower than Q2 due to the timing of E-Rate sales to educational institutions. Nonetheless, third quarter bookings of $20 million were just $1 million short of the record set in Q2.
In summary, Business Services is performing very well and we're still targeting at least $5 billion in annual revenue in the Business Services area by 2018.
Other operations revenue declined 4.8% in Q3. Media sales revenue was down $25 million from last year, primarily due to lower political advertising revenue, which was $5 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million a year earlier. And third quarter Other revenue increased primarily due to RSN affiliate fees from Residential Services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation.

As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $50 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.",691,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $50 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA has been temporarily reduced by our proactive strategy initiated in 2014 to increase investment and functions that touched customers, enhance the customer experience and improve our operating reliability. Through these efforts, we expect we'll be able to connect more customers and retain them longer, which increases their value.
In their remarks, Rob and Bill highlighted the impressive subscriber results our investments are already delivering. I'll cover the financial dimensions of these investments in my comments.
As in recent quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in a number of areas in Q3, notably pickups in customer care, which together increased $50 million or 8.2%. Of course, a significant part of this increase was driven by our success in adding customer relationships. If you look at it on a per CR basis, pickups in care grew a little over 5% year-over-year. And if you looked at it on a per PSU basis, the year-over-year increase is even more modest.
These functions are instrumental in driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand in glove with our network reliability improvements and TWC Maxx deployments. 
Furthermore, we increased sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.4%. Unit growth was the big driver here, as sales and marketing per CR connect was actually slightly lower than last year's third quarter.
Programming and content costs, which increased $135 million or 10.2% year-over-year, continue to be the biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA. As in Q2, contractual affiliate fee increases of roughly $100 million and a contractual increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees were the 2 biggest components of the increase.
In the Residential segment, average programming cost per video sub was $42.43, up $3.47 or 8.9% from last year.
Pension expense increased $28 million in Q3 and $81 million in the first 9 months of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million or roughly a $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates.
Shared functions costs increased 7.2% to $763 million in the third quarter as a result of higher compensation cost per employee and the lumpiness of certain expense categories, including maintenance and insurance.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, adjusted OIBDA ex-pension was pretty much flat versus last year. We continue to expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension to be down slightly, being down less than a percentage point versus last year.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.62, down $0.24 from a year ago. Higher depreciation expense, which is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to accommodate increased subscriber volumes and Internet traffic as well as to improve the operations and future prospects of the company, continued to be a driver of lower EPS.
Third quarter CapEx of $1.1 billion reflects strong subscriber growth as well as improvements at the plant and our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems.
We also continue to invest in future growth of Business Services, where we connected 18,000 commercial buildings to our network in the quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, we added 50,000 commercial buildings to our network, representing almost $750 million [ph] in serviceable annual opportunity.
Free cash flow was $441 million in the third quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year, helped by a positive move in working capital.
At the end of Q3, net debt stood at $22.2 billion, down $801 million from year-end 2014.
So to summarize, the business is very healthy and we're making tremendous progress on our transformation. We continue to believe that our subscriber and revenue momentum will transfer into strong financial performance in 2016.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

So when we launc",624,"Sure, Craig. Let me take it in 2 steps. Let's first talk about the New York City beta, and then we'll come back to skinny bundles. So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we launched the TWC TV App, which, of course, is the -- is our IPTV app, the goal there was to create an offering that was complementary to our traditional video product, to add additional screens on additional IP-enabled devices for customers to consume video. As we move forward and what we're trialing with this beta in New York is we're going to move that TWC TV capability toward a full video offering that, in fact, could be substitutional for the traditional set-top box-based video product. And where we're headed is the ability of customers to access the complete video product without having to rent the set-top box from us, whether they use a Roku or they use ultimately another IP-enabled device. So what we need to accomplish that is, first, we need to ensure that our video -- that, that video product complies with Title VI of the Telecom Act in the same way that our traditional video service does, meaning emergency alert service, closed captioning, SAP and all of those things that comply with the law. So we're doing that in the beta. Second thing we've got to do is ensure that we have a complete channel lineup. The TWC TV App already has a very significant channel lineup, but it doesn't include every single PEG channel and, in some markets, there are local channels that aren't yet included, so we need to make sure that, that's in there. And then, lastly, we really need to take the quality of the video picture from what I would essentially call an SD picture to an HD picture. So we're going to increase the resolution on those pictures to just deliver a better video experience. And then, over time, you'll see us add additional features to the TWC TV App until it is, from an experience perspective, indistinguishable from the traditional video product, but with the added benefits of no need to rent the set-top box and a much, much more streamlined provisioning process, no necessity for a truck roll, you can simply type in your username and password, and you have video. So that's what we're trying to accomplish with the beta. Why we chose to offer the full complement of channels really is consistent with our strategy on video overall. We want to make sure the customers can have everything they have via the set-top box. That does not mean that we're not ultimately going to get to a place where we offer alternative bundles via that app as well. We're big fans of customer segmentation. We're big fans of giving customers choice. But right now, and we've been very effective at this as you can see in our video numbers this quarter, we've actually tried to simplify our offerings, make them easier to buy for customers and easier to sell for our reps, and that has driven us to kind of simplify our offerings. But does not mean, in the fullness of time, we won't push hard on things like basic cable plus a premium or our TV Essentials product, both of which are variations on the theme of skinnier bundles. And the last thing I've noticed again this quarter, and this has been true for a couple of quarters now, about 82% of our gross video connects actually took our preferred TV product. So for all the talk about skinny bundles, we're doing pretty well offering a full video product."

I think a combination of that transparency on the front-end, coupled with really working hard in the overall customer experience through the life of that first 12 months will give us a much better churn profile than the past experiences that you're talking about. I think in the past, in one occasion, the value of the going in bundle was so high that when the prices rolled, the differential was just way too high. That's not the case this time. So we feel really good about what's going to happen. And the very earliest customers that we put on in the triple play bundle last year has started to roll, and our experience with those customers has been very positive so far."

First, I think the answer to the second part of your question is both, fewer people attempting to leave and better effectiveness on our retention efforts. In terms of the relationship between the decline in voluntary churn or decline in churn generally and revenue per user, it's kind of a strange dynamic going on. So we talked a lot about the impact of increases in connect volume on ARPU in that the customers were bringing on in greater numbers now generate less revenue per customer than our existing base. So we drive higher revenue, but lower ARPU. On the other side, on the retention side, interestingly, the customers we're losing right now are also lower than the existing base. So ironically, when you lose fewer of them, you actually have a negative impact on ARPU. And these strange dynamics are kind of why I counsel against putting too much emphasis on ARPU and more emphasis on the combination of both rate and volume and what it means for revenue growth."

The only catch is that, that requires us to essentially rent network from other providers, whether it's other MSOs or other telecom providers to serve customers who have locations outside of our footprint, which, in the case of enterprises, is more often the case than not. Those are -- that piece of the product is inherently less profitable than when we serve customers with our own network, but it's still certainly an interesting business opportunity for us."

So we're not necessarily thinking about it as a product that is designed for a particular segment, although admittedly, it may expand the universe of potential customers by bringing in those types of customers that have been averse to having a set-top box in their family room. When we think about returns, we're going to have to figure out a model here that generates a return that is appropriate for the investments we're making, and that may require that we find a way to replicate revenue that currently comes in the form of set-top box rental revenue. But I think this is early days. The reason we're beta-ing this is to make sure that we understand how to do it technically and to make sure we understand what the provisioning experiences for customers and then, overall, it's good for them. If the product is attractive to customers, I'm fairly confident we're going to figure out a way to generate adequate returns."

So we responded to all of the RFIs put out by the FCC. We've responded to the DOJ second request. We're making very good strides at the states and local franchise levels. In fact, most of the states that we need to approve the deal have approved and most of the local franchises that need to approve the deal have approved. So we're making good headway there.

We've talked about the fact that new connect revenue per customer is more or less the same year-over-year, and that's reflective of the fact that we've lowered the amount we're receiving for each type of cohort, but we're selling a whole lot more triples. And the theory behind that is we think we're delivering a lot more value to our customers. As a result, they're going to be happier customers and we're going to retain them longer, which, in turn, means they have a greater lifetime value to us. So that's the theory of the case there. The revenue lift when we are adding phone is more modest than it has been in the past, probably in the nature of $10 versus 20-some-odd dollars a while ago. You want me to? Okay. I'm going to handle your second question as well, James. I think how we scale an IP video product that replaces our traditional video product is one of the reasons we're trialing. There's in -- with today's technology, every one of those IP streams is a unicast, so it's consuming bandwidth just like a VOD stream, so we don't get the benefit of broadcast efficiency. And figuring out how to manage that on our network is part of the reason why we're beta-ing this particular offering. That said, we feel fairly confident about the capability of our network to ultimately deliver a video product that is IP delivered, even a unicast IP video product. So that's what we're at."

And I think I might have fallen into this trap as well, but let me make it very clear. Our beta, our IP video offering is not over-the-top. I know it's common to us to equate IP with over-the-top. In fact, this is a video service that we are delivering over our facilities, not over anybody else's. It may -- over time, there may be a TV anywhere component -- TV Everywhere component to this just like there is one to our traditional video offering, but what we're talking about here is a managed video service over our network. So just get -- to get that clarification out of the way. In terms of economics, I think we don't really know, but let me give you some of the puts and takes, and I think you have isolated a couple of them. Clearly, the service model may be fundamentally different. The install process will be far less labor-intensive, and that's certainly a good guy in terms of the economics of doing the business. It's certainly a less capital-intensive model in that customers will likely bring their own devices, and that will reduce the CPE capital requirements for us. At the same token, at least with today's technology, there may be a greater bandwidth requirement, so that's an offset the other way. And then, the care model I think really needs to evolve. And we don't yet know how that's going to work, and that's why I'm a little hesitant to declare exactly what the economics are. But I think it's reasonable to assume that this is a model that could turn out to be more interesting, more compelling for us. But more importantly, we think it's going to be a great customer experience. And ultimately, that's what's driving our interest in pursuing this thing. In terms of the broadband pricing question, I don't -- I can't give you an outlook on where broadband pricing is going, except to say we're going to continue to deliver more and more utility to customers and, generally speaking, where customers get more value out of your products, they're willing to pay more. But what we actually charge is going to be a function of what the marketplace dictates. It's a very competitive market out there, and we're going to have to continue to price our products in a way that allows us to acquire and retain them. On usage-based pricing concession, as you described it, I'll say, this is -- it's not really appropriate for me to answer the question. Charter, as the acquirer, made the concession or offered up that they would not use -- implement usage-based pricing. They don't implement usage-based pricing today. So I think it's a better question for Tom and his team as to what they're thinking was on offering that up."

Q3 was just the latest in a 7-quarter string of improving performance. Subscriber growth was simply fantastic, revenue growth accelerated and we continue to make significant investments in our network, equipment, products and customer service. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish amid a prolonged period of merger-related activity. It's really a testament to our well-thought out operating plan and the commitment and focus of our entire team, all 55,000 employees who work tirelessly every day to make Time Warner Cable an even better company.
Bill will cover our subscriber results in more detail, but I do want to call out a few highlights. This was, without a doubt, our best overall third quarter subscriber performance ever. We added 147,000 residential custom relationships, the first positive third quarter net additions since 2008.
Both connects and disconnects were better than last year's Q3 and the improvement was broad-based. We added customers in each of our geographic regions and fared well against all competitors. Customer relationship gross adds were up and churn was down footprint-wide and, most notably, in those areas served by U-verse and FiOS.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've added roughly 570,000 residential customers against our 3-year goal of adding 1 million CRs. That's a 4% increase in our subbase and well ahead of our original plan. 
Despite all the talk about a contraction in the broader multichannel video marketplace, our video performance was really good. We lost just 7,000 residential video subs in the quarter, the best third quarter result since 2006. And through the end of last week, we're within just 9,000 residential video subs of our goal of posting positive video subs for the full year.  Regardless of exactly where we land, this is an incredible turnaround from 2 years ago.
I'm pleased with our financial performance as well. Top line growth was 3.6% with a more balanced contribution from Residential and Business Services. Residential revenue increased 2.6%, the best organic third quarter growth since 2010. Businesses -- Business Services turned in yet another quarter of more than $100 million of year-over-year revenue growth.
Total company adjusted OIBDA, while down year-over-year, came in a bit better than we anticipated. Consistent with our prior guidance, we still expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension expense to be down less than 1% year-over-year.
We continue to be single-mindedly focused on improving the customer experience. In Q3, we, again, delivered improvements in key customer service metrics. Care calls and repair-related truck rolls per customer relationship were down by 11% and 16%, respectively. Our on-time arrival rate within our industry-leading one hour appointment windows was 98%, and rework declined by 11%.
As you may have noticed, we've started to highlight some of these customer service improvements in our advertising. We're the first to acknowledge that we've got a long way to go, but the strides we're making are significant, and I'm incredibly proud of what the team has been able to accomplish.
We also continued the aggressive rollout of TWC Maxx, including deployments of all-digital video and Internet speeds of up to 300 megabits per second.
We completed TWC Maxx in Kansas City in August and in Dallas earlier this month. Deployments are progressing well in Raleigh, Charlotte, Wilmington, Greensboro, San Antonio and Hawaii. In addition, we'll start the San Diego rollout in the next several weeks.
In addition to Maxx, we continue to invest in our network and equipment across our entire footprint to enhance reliability and the overall customer experience.
In the first 9 months of the year, we've deployed 2 million new set-tops, all of which run our cloud-based guide, 3.1 million high-definition digital adapters and over 3 million advanced wireless gateways.
Our investments in reliability and customer service, including TWC Maxx, are starting to bear fruit. Voluntary churn among residential subs is showing very positive trends. In non-Maxx markets, we've driven voluntary churn for each of video and broadband, down 15% year-over-year. That's impressive in its own right. But in Maxx markets, voluntary churn is down around twice that.
We're also seeing improved customer satisfaction across all geographic regions, with New York City and Los Angeles, our first 2 Maxx markets, posting the greatest improvements this quarter.
So to sum it up, we're executing very well and our customers are beginning to recognize the changes. In the meantime, the team is working work well with Charter to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our deal and to plan for the integration of our companies.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill Osbourn and then Matt Siegel who will tag team the review of our Q3 results. After they comment on the quarter, the 3 of us, along with Dinni, will be available for Q&A. Bill?"

Our third quarter looked a lot like the quarter that preceded it, with continuing progress in Residential Services and a strong performance in Business Services. 
With that as background, let me turn to the Q3 highlights, starting with customer relationships, where we, once again, performed exceptionally well.
We gained 147,000 residential customer relationships in the third quarter, making this the best third quarter ever. The last time we delivered positive CR net adds in the third quarter was back in 2008. And in the preceding quarter, the Q3 residential CR performance was driven by a 9% increase in connects, as in the preceding quarter, they were driven by a 9% increase in connects. The 3 key sales channels: Inbound sales, online sales and direct sales, continued to perform significantly better than a year ago. Disconnects improved by almost 5% year-over-year, even better than our Q2 performance. Third quarter churn improvement was driven primarily by improvements in voluntary and nonpaid disconnects.
PSU performance in Q3 was also outstanding. Residential PSU net adds, up 462,000, were more than 0.5 million better than in last year's Q3. The PSU growth was driven by strong triple play net adds. Residential triple play net adds of 218,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2007. It's noteworthy that we now have more than 5 million residential triple play customers. That's roughly 1/3 of our customer relationships.
Third quarter residential video subscriber performance was the best in 9 years. We came within 7,000 subs of breakeven for the quarter. That's 177,000 better than last year. And as Rob told you, we're still driving towards positive video net adds for the full year, which will be a major milestone.
Broadband volume was very strong. Residential net adds of 232,000 were the best for our third quarter since 2006. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 700,000 residential broadband customers.
Residential phone net adds of 237,000 were the strongest for a third quarter in 8 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've added more than 800,000 residential phone customers.
The quality of the residential subscriber base continues to be very solid. ARPU per new connect is up slightly year-over-year and early life churn continue to be materially lower than a year earlier, just a couple of indicators that we're generating high-quality connects. And similar to Q2, 37% of new customer connects in Q3 were triple plays, which tend to churn less than singles and doubles.
With that, let's move on to our Q3 financial results. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was up 3.6% year-over-year. We grew third quarter Residential Services revenue by $120 million or 2.6%, the best organic year-over-year Q3 Residential revenue growth since 2010.
Residential ARPU per customer relationship of $106.42 was roughly flat with last year, with recurring revenue per customer up a tad and nonrecurring revenue down slightly. Again, remember that we're driving very strong volumes of customer connects at promotional rates that are lower than the average of our existing customer base, so it's just math that our success in driving volume is increasing revenue growth, but at the same time, tempering ARPU growth.
Business Services posted another excellent quarter. Revenue increased $112 million or 15.5% year-over-year in Q3. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth above $100 million. HSD led the way, up 20.1%, and contributing more than half the Business Services revenue growth. The balance of the revenue increase came roughly equally from voice, which grew 15.9%, and wholesale transport, which was up 16.2%. It's worth noting that Q3 sales generally come in a little lower than Q2 due to the timing of E-Rate sales to educational institutions. Nonetheless, third quarter bookings of $20 million were just $1 million short of the record set in Q2.
In summary, Business Services is performing very well and we're still targeting at least $5 billion in annual revenue in the Business Services area by 2018.
Other operations revenue declined 4.8% in Q3. Media sales revenue was down $25 million from last year, primarily due to lower political advertising revenue, which was $5 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million a year earlier. And third quarter Other revenue increased primarily due to RSN affiliate fees from Residential Services segment. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation.

862598,312945561,917125,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning. As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $50 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.",692,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. As noted, total company adjusted OIBDA declined $74 million or 3.6% in Q3. Excluding pension expense, adjusted OIBDA was down $46 million or 2.2%. That's roughly $50 million better than the expectation we set last quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA has been temporarily reduced by our proactive strategy initiated in 2014 to increase investment in functions that touch customers, enhance the customer experience and improve our operating reliability. Through these efforts, we expect we'll be able to connect more customers and retain them longer, which increases their value.
In their remarks, Rob and Bill highlighted the impressive subscriber results our investments are already delivering. I'll cover the financial dimensions of these investments in my comments.
As in recent quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in a number of areas in Q3, notably tech ops and customer care, which together increased $50 million or 8.2%. Of course, a significant part of this increase was driven by our success in adding customer relationships. If you look at it on a per CR basis, tech ops and care grew a little over 5% year-over-year. And if you looked at it on a per PSU basis, the year-over-year increase is even more modest.
These functions are instrumental in driving a better customer experience, and investments in these areas go hand in glove with our network reliability improvements and TWC Maxx deployments. 
Furthermore, we increased sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter by a similar amount, $52 million or 9.4%. Unit growth was the big driver here, as sales and marketing per CR connect was actually slightly lower than last year's third quarter.
Programming and content costs, which increased $135 million or 10.2% year-over-year, continue to be the biggest drag on adjusted OIBDA. As in Q2, contractual affiliate fee increases of roughly $100 million and a contractual increase of around $30 million in Dodgers rights fees were the 2 biggest components of the increase.
In the Residential segment, average programming cost per video sub was $42.43, up $3.47 or 8.9% from last year.
Pension expense increased $28 million in Q3 and $81 million in the first 9 months of the year. We expect full year pension expense to be approximately $190 million or roughly a $110 million increase over last year due almost entirely to the decline in interest rates.
Shared functions costs increased 7.2% to $763 million in the third quarter as a result of higher compensation cost per employee and the lumpiness of certain expense categories, including maintenance and insurance.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, adjusted OIBDA ex-pension was pretty much flat versus last year. We continue to expect full year adjusted OIBDA ex-pension to be down slightly, being down less than a percentage point versus last year.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.62, down $0.24 from a year ago. Higher depreciation expense, which is a clear reflection of the large capital investment we're making to accommodate increased subscriber volumes and Internet traffic as well as to improve the operations and future prospects of the company, continued to be a driver of lower EPS.
Third quarter CapEx of $1.1 billion reflects strong subscriber growth as well as improvements at the plant and our aggressive investment in CPE as we continue to deploy new set-tops, DTAs and modems.
We also continue to invest in future growth of Business Services, where we connected 18,000 commercial buildings to our network in the quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, we added 50,000 commercial buildings to our network, representing almost $750 million in serviceable annual opportunity.
Free cash flow was $441 million in the third quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year, helped by a positive move in working capital.
At the end of Q3, net debt stood at $22.2 billion, down $801 million from year-end 2014.
So to summarize, the business is very healthy and we're making tremendous progress on our transformation. We continue to believe that our subscriber and revenue momentum will translate into strong financial performance in 2016.

So when we laun",625,"Sure, Craig. Let me take it in 2 steps. Let's first talk about the New York City beta, and then we'll come back to skinny bundles.  So the way I would characterize the New York City trial is really the next step in the evolution of TWC TV. So when we launched the TWC TV App, which, of course, is the -- is our IPTV app, the goal there was to create an offering that was complementary to our traditional video product, to add additional screens on additional IP-enabled devices for customers to consume video.  As we move forward and what we're trialing with this beta in New York is we're going to move that TWC TV capability toward a full video offering that, in fact, could be substitutional for the traditional set-top box-based video product. And where we're headed is the ability of customers to access the complete video product without having to rent the set-top box from us, whether they use a Roku or they use ultimately another IP-enabled device.  So what we need to accomplish that is, first, we need to ensure that our video -- that, that video product complies with Title VI of the Telecom Act in the same way that our traditional video service does, meaning emergency alert service, closed captioning, SAP and all of those things that comply with the law. So we're doing that in the beta.  Second thing we've got to do is ensure that we have a complete channel lineup. The TWC TV App already has a very significant channel lineup, but it doesn't include every single PEG channel and, in some markets, there are local channels that aren't yet included, so we need to make sure that, that's in there.  And then, lastly, we really need to take the quality of the video picture from what I would essentially call an SD picture to an HD picture. So we're going to increase the resolution on those pictures to just deliver a better video experience.  And then, over time, you'll see us add additional features to the TWC TV App until it is, from an experience perspective, indistinguishable from the traditional video product, but with the added benefits of no need to rent the set-top box and a much, much more streamlined provisioning process, no necessity for a truck roll, you can simply type in your username and password, and you have video. So that's what we're trying to accomplish with the beta.  Why we chose to offer the full complement of channels really is consistent with our strategy on video overall. We want to make sure the customers can have everything they have via the set-top box. That does not mean that we're not ultimately going to get to a place where we offer alternative bundles via that app as well. We're big fans of customer segmentation. We're big fans of giving customers choice. But right now, and we've been very effective at this as you can see in our video numbers this quarter, we've actually tried to simplify our offerings, make them easier to buy for customers and easier to sell for our reps, and that has driven us to kind of simplify our offerings. But does not mean, in the fullness of time, we won't push hard on things like basic cable plus a premium or our TV Essentials product, both of which are variations on the theme of skinnier bundles.  And the last thing I'd note is, again this quarter, and this has been true for a couple of quarters now, about 82% of our gross video connects actually took our preferred TV product. So for all the talk about skinny bundles, we're doing pretty well offering a full video product."

I think in the past, in one occasion, the value of the going in bundle was so high that when the prices rolled, the differential was just way too high. That's not the case this time. So we feel really good about what's going to happen. And the very earliest customers that we put on in the triple play bundle last year has started to roll, and our experience with those customers has been very positive so far."

First, I think the answer to the second part of your question is both, fewer people attempting to leave and better effectiveness on our retention efforts.  In terms of the relationship between the decline in voluntary churn or decline in churn generally and revenue per user, it's kind of a strange dynamic going on. So we talked a lot about the impact of increases in connect volume on ARPU in that the customers we're bringing on in greater numbers now, generate less revenue per customer than our existing base. So we drive higher revenue, but lower ARPU.  On the other side, on the retention side, interestingly, the customers we're losing right now are also lower than the existing base. So ironically, when you lose fewer of them, you actually have a negative impact on ARPU. And these strange dynamics are kind of why I counsel against putting too much emphasis on ARPU and more emphasis on the combination of both rate and volume and what it means for revenue growth."

So we're not necessarily thinking about it as a product that is designed for a particular segment, although admittedly, it may expand the universe of potential customers by bringing in those types of customers that have been averse to having a set-top box in their family room.  When we think about returns, we're going to have to figure out a model here that generates a return that is appropriate for the investments we're making, and that may require that we find a way to replicate revenue that currently comes in the form of set-top box rental revenue.  But I think this is early days. The reason we're beta-ing this is to make sure that we understand how to do it technically and to make sure we understand what the provisioning experiences for customers and then, overall, it's good for them.  If the product is attractive to customers, I'm fairly confident we're going to figure out a way to generate adequate returns."

We're going to continue to pursue our strategy of adding mobility to our offerings by continuing to deploy WiFi hotspots. We think that adds compelling value to our high-speed data product. So we'll continue to pursue that. There's no question that mobility is important to customers. But I think whether or not we need to deliver a quad play, so to speak, or add a cellular product to our current offerings I think remains to be seen.  Clearly, if the marketplace evolves in such a way that, that's an offering that our competitors deliver, then I think we may need to revisit it. I think that's what's happened in Europe where you have complete overlap of footprints of wireless and wireline providers, and that's the way the competitive market has evolved. But I'm not convinced that it's necessarily has to go that way here."

So if there's one thing I've learned over the last couple of years is that I'm not terribly good at predicting when regulators are going to act on our deals. So I'm not going to give you a projected closing date.  What I will say is that we are working very well with Charter and with Bright House to ensure that everything we can do to put the regulators in a position to act on our deal expeditiously, we're doing. So we responded to all of the RFIs put out by the FCC. We've responded to the DOJ second request. We're making very good strides at the states and local franchise levels. In fact, most of the states that we need to approve the deal have approved and most of the local franchises that need to approve the deal have approved. So we're making good headway there.  I think you're well aware of the FCC's comment schedule. Comments were due last week. The responses to those comments are due next week. And then, about 10 days after that, replies to those responses are due. So that kind of will enable the FCC to have a complete record. And my hope is then we'll begin to engage in earnest thereafter. But beyond that, hard to say.  From an operational perspective, we are working to be in a position to close as early as this year. But admittedly, at this point, that feels ambitious."

And really, we've seen an improvement year-over-year on the write-offs, and we believe that's a reflection of the better quality customers that we're taking on, and also the way we're working with those customers on a consistent basis across the company when we turned them over to a third party collection expense, which actually third party collection expense is the fourth component of bad debt expense, although not a large component.  So we have improved write-off levels. And we also have improved late fees, year-over-year late fee collections, which has contributed to the improved or reduced net bad debt expense year-over-year.

We've talked about the fact that new connect revenue per customer is more or less the same year-over-year, and that's reflective of the fact that we've lowered the amount we're receiving for each type of cohort, but we're selling a whole lot more triples. And the theory behind that is we think we're delivering a lot more value to our customers. As a result, they're going to be happier customers and we're going to retain them longer, which, in turn, means they have a greater lifetime value to us. So that's the theory of the case there.  The revenue lift when we are adding phone is more modest than it has been in the past, probably in the nature of $10 versus 20-some-odd dollars a while ago.  You want me to? Okay. I'm going to handle your second question as well, James. I think how we scale an IP video product that replaces our traditional video product is one of the reasons we're trialing. There's in -- with today's technology, every one of those IP streams is a unicast, so it's consuming bandwidth just like a VOD stream, so we don't get the benefit of broadcast efficiency. And figuring out how to manage that on our network is part of the reason why we're beta-ing this particular offering. That said, we feel fairly confident about the capability of our network to ultimately deliver a video product that is IP delivered, even a unicast IP video product. So that's where we're at."

But it's something that we'll clearly pay attention to going forward.  In terms of the FiOS U-verse competitive environment, I think we hit this before, but we attribute our recent positive performance to what we're doing internally more than any actions on the part of either FiOS or U-verse or distractions that might have been plaguing U-verse, given the pendency of the DIRECTV deal or, alternatively, Verizon's focus on wireless.

And then, I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit on where you see broadband pricing going over time. Our analysis suggests that broadband, as a product, is underpriced. As part of the merger conditions, you made a concession to not moving towards usage-based pricing for a number of years.

And I think I might have fallen into this trap as well, but let me make it very clear. Our beta, our IP video offering is not over-the-top. I know it's common to us to equate IP with over-the-top. In fact, this is a video service that we are delivering over our facilities, not over anybody else's. It may -- over time, there may be a TV anywhere component -- TV Everywhere component to this just like there is one to our traditional video offering, but what we're talking about here is a managed video service over our network. So just get -- to get that clarification out of the way.  In terms of economics, I think we don't really know, but let me give you some of the puts and takes, and I think you have isolated a couple of them. Clearly, the service model may be fundamentally different. The install process will be far less labor-intensive, and that's certainly a good guy in terms of the economics of doing the business. It's certainly a less capital-intensive model in that customers will likely bring their own devices, and that will reduce the CPE capital requirements for us. At the same token, at least with today's technology, there may be a greater bandwidth requirement, so that's an offset the other way. And then, the care model I think really needs to evolve. And we don't yet know how that's going to work, and that's why I'm a little hesitant to declare exactly what the economics are. But I think it's reasonable to assume that this is a model that could turn out to be more interesting, more compelling for us. But more importantly, we think it's going to be a great customer experience. And ultimately, that's what's driving our interest in pursuing this thing.  In terms of the broadband pricing question, I don't -- I can't give you an outlook on where broadband pricing is going, except to say we're going to continue to deliver more and more utility to customers and, generally speaking, where customers get more value out of your products, they're willing to pay more. But what we actually charge is going to be a function of what the marketplace dictates. It's a very competitive market out there, and we're going to have to continue to price our products in a way that allows us to acquire and retain them.  On usage-based pricing concession, as you described it, I'll say, this is -- it's not really appropriate for me to answer the question. Charter, as the acquirer, made the concession or offered up that they would not use -- implement usage-based pricing. They don't implement usage-based pricing today. So I think it's a better question for Tom and his team as to what their thinking was on offering that up."
