And thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. 
Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who heads up Planning and Investor Relations for us. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. That press release also includes replay information for today's call. 
We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the SEC. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as part of this presentation, which is available on our website. 
For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of 2 discrete items. First, the purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue in our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and HSP, which we completed in the third quarter. That totals about $1.4 million. 
As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. 
In addition, we had in inventory step up charge for IPA for about $400,000. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3 -- sorry, Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?"

We'll try to get this call finished before your [indiscernible] on. So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We",4374,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We'll try to get this call finished before your [indiscernible] on. 
So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We had all-time records for incoming orders revenue that we build and net earnings EBITDA cash flow. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7%, and we had pretty much broad-based growth everyplace. Operating margins in the quarter reached 30.1%, which was up 110 basis points and the operating leverage was pretty spectacular in the quarter at 47%. We'll comment about leverage going forward with in our guidance. 
Net earnings were up 13% to $187 million or $1.85 and operating cash flow was up sharply, $1 billion run rate there at $261 million in the quarter, up 11% with free cash flow in that same category. It's very little CapEx this year, about 1% of revenue. So very strong fourth quarter. 
Next slide. We look at the income statement here, you can the orders were up to $924 million versus $900 million a year ago, up 3%. Book-to-bill was 0.98, but -- so we said before sort of 0.97 to 1.03 is the normal spread. But in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was always very low -- relatively low because we had so much more year-end and we think so really that book-to-bill of 0.98 is not a problem, and we finished the year at 1.0. 
Revenue was up 7%. We had about 2 points of negative foreign exchange headwinds here in the fourth quarter. 
Gross profit stayed at remarkably high level year here about 60%. The operating margin as we said before had 47% leverage. And that was just strong across the board as you'll see. 
The tax rate was 60 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, which gave us about $0.015, so you can see the depth numbers of $1.85 versus last year's $1.65. 
Next slide. Cash flow performance in the quarter was spectacular. We had 140% operating cash flow conversion and 136% free cash flow conversion. Our cash flow has been growing. As you can see, if you look at 2012, and then '13 and '14, that's an 11% CAGR on operating cash flow the last 2 years. And our free cash flow was 23% of revenue, which is about same as last year's 23% of revenue. Pretty spectacular number. 
We still think cash is the best measure of performance. And if you follow our free cash flow, and you follow the continued growth then you can get a much better understanding about the quality of the company's businesses. 
Here, we start the full year enterprise results, next slide. If we look at the full year income statement, orders were above $3.5 billion, they were up 5% and the book-to-bill was exactly 1.0. 
The revenue was up 9% with organic up 6% for the year, which was certainly in the wheelhouse of what we established as guidance at the beginning of the year. 
Gross margin for the full year was up 70 basis points to 59.3 and our operating margin was up 120 basis points. And for the full year, we had operating leverage of 42%. We used to talk about well, I can go back to 25 to 30, and then it was 30 to 35. And recently, it's been 35 to 40, and we're going to suggest that forward guidance for us is going to have operating leverage at 40% or above on the next dollar of revenue. 
Operating income was up 13%. The earnings before tax were up 16%. Tax was a headwind for us this year as we suggested it would be at the beginning of the year. It was 29.9% versus 29% last year, that cost an $0.08 headwind in our earnings, but even with that $0.08, we still produced $6.42, up 14% and the GAAP number, of course, was up 19% on earnings per share. 
Next slide. In terms of EBITDA and margin, on the left-hand side, you'll see EBITDA has increased over the last 2 years by 30% from $925 million in 2012 to $1.2 billion this year, that's a $276 million increase. 
On EBITDA margins, we continue to improve margins, I think, rather spectacularly. 2012, our EBITDA was 30.8%. People were saying, oh boy, you're going to have to revert to the mean now, you'll be back down with everybody else in the 20s. Well, of course, quite in the contrary, that's just wrong. They were at 32.8 last year and 33.8 this year, and that's all about our governance system and the quality of our businesses, record EBITDA performance. 
Next slide. Here, again, you see a tribute to the governance model what we have and the field execution. Our asset-light business model inventory now running 5.1%, receivables at 16.1% and the way we look at the working capital number, you can see it's dropped from 7% 2 years ago when people thought that was an unbelievably good number to now 5% at the end of this year. So our guys continue to understand how to execute our asset-light business model. 
Next slide. Now we look at the strong financial position and the balance sheet of the company, it's certainly a powerful balance sheet with a lot of power that we intend to use. 
You can see that cash has gone up to $610 million. Now a lot of that is not the U.S., but our cash and undrawn revolver gives us a $2.1 billion capacity. The trailing 12 months EBITDA now has gone up to $1.2 billion, so our gross debt number at $2.2 billion is 1.8x our EBITDA, and we're going to be quite comfortable if it's at least a turn higher. We'll discuss our activity that's going to be occurring in the first quarter and throughout the year later, but we still believe we're going to deploy about $8 billion over the next 5 years in transactions. 
Next slide. We'll get into the specific detail now on the segment. If we look first at the revenue growth by segment last year, you'll see in the left-hand side on our organic basis, energy was up 5%, Industrial Technology, half of which is Neptune, was up 7%. Our Radio Frequency was up 5% and Medical was up 8%.  If we look at the total revenue growth by segment, you'll see Medical was up 16% as the acquisitions added to the organic number. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the overall segment performance on $1.00 value and EBITDA basis so that you can get some better clarity on the fact that RF and Medical represents about 2/3 of our total EBITDA progression, and it's well over half of our revenue now. 
So the original sort of energy business is the smallest segment we have at $692 million, still outstanding performance with $226 million of EBITDA and the largest section. First time that we've ever had $1 billion segment in Roper, so you now have Medical with $108,002,000,000 in revenue, pretty good solid standalone entity, but $472 million in EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the oil and gas component of the company, the legacy of the company was oil and gas and up until through 2007, it was a pretty big portion in the overall company. 
Today, it's a very, very small portion. Our upstream represents 5%, our Medical, RF and software water markets were 86% of the company. And the downstream, midstream, which is actually going to have modest growth this year is about 9%. 
Now what the slide showing you in addition to the breakout here, our Upstream business is about 5% of revenue. Some of that is in the Energy sector and some is in the Industrial Technology sector, where Roper Pump resides. 
We have -- even though the market we think will be down 20% perhaps even a little bit more, or we have a benefit in the Roper Pump has these technologies that we launched and the new facility to get broader categories of those into the marketplace quickly in Houston a year ago. Well, those shipments didn't really start to occur until the second half of the year in any level, so we have an easy comp with the first half of 2015 in those products, in which we're gaining share, so that will mitigate what normally would have been a deeper decline in upstream. 
In our field service and retrofit activity in midstream it's actually continuing to move up a little bit. And then we have the refinery instrumentation businesses in the field service associated with that also, which will have modest growth. 
One of the things we did in December is we had all of our oil and gas people in for a couple of the meeting where we did a focused review to recast what they had originally submitted for 2015 projections. We had them bridge the risk by customer and by category, by product line. We reviewed the contingency plans and the triggers that they had in place. These guys are world-class and nimble execution. As they did a new stop, they made a few changes already and are monitoring activity routinely. In fact, Friday, we had a dust up on exactly where we were January today. I'd have to say that the momentum is actually as good as it was in the fourth quarter. We really aren't seeing anything related to product fall off at all. It's above our expectation through the first 3 weeks of January, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But there has not been any early indicator yet other than project delays. And what you'll hear from other people who haven't really determining their CapEx plans to later. But most of our products are not going into CapEx driven activity. 
The guidance that we established and we'll talk about reflects the up-to-date business expectations of all of our oil and gas people as of January 23. And as I stated, our product activity hasn't slowed. 
The other thing I think as I've read some of the commentary about the company is people thinking that there's some way to ascertain something that happened in 2008 or 2009 for our company, and, I guess, we just failed to do a good enough job to remind people who we are. 
If you look at 2008, we had CBORD in February, and then later in the year, we had Horizon and Get Loaded and Tech Club, 3 software companies. And those weren't in full year for '08. 
And then if you look at our acquisition since '08 where people are doing comparisons, we've added United total, which is a software system that's driving so much of our growth in TransCore. The iTradeNetwork, Verathon, Northern Digital Medical, Ascension Medical, Managed Health Care Associates, Sunquest, Strategic Healthcare programs last year they had product achievements last year, FoodLink and now Strata Decision Technology, all these are either medical or software companies that created over $1 billion of revenue that's in our numbers today that wasn't there in 2007. So to say there's some quid pro quo on this just belies the reality of who we are and what we become. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the Energy Systems & Controls sector we can tell you that there's about $125 million of revenue upstream out of our total Energy Systems & Controls business. 
You can see in the fourth quarter, their operating profit was up 11%. Their OP margin reached 36.1%, up 280 basis points and EBITDA or energy in the fourth quarter was 39%. 
Organic revenue was up 4%. We had very significant strength really in some of the businesses that people think are going backwards, which as far as now, we're not. So these shut off systems was up in the high teens, and so is vibration monitoring, field service growth continued, but we did see project activity declining at CCC postponement, so that's something that we'll be watching carefully throughout 2015. 
As we look at guidance establishing for next year, we look at upstream declining, which is about 20% of the revenue in the segment. And then we think the midstream and downstream will have very modest growth and that represents about 40% of the total segment. 
And then the non-oil and gas business services are another 40% of the Energy Systems & Controls. 
So when we net it all together with the declines in the upstream, modest growth in the non-oil and gas arena, this segment, we think, will come in flat to modest organic growth for the year. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at Industrial Technology. In Industrial Technology, we have about $75 million of upstream revenue in the entire segment.  And oil and gas sort of split a little bit between the upstream, not much downstream in the segment, maybe another $25 million at the most. 
Here, you can see that organic growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, broad-based throughout the different businesses in this segment. The Roper Pump had all-time performance records. They continue to win new customers with the newer technology and the product investments that we made over the last 2 years have really driven substantial revenue and certainly helped us as we get the end market falloff in that activity. 
We had growth at Neptune driven by strength of the U.S. market. We're starting to see the Toronto project wind down and we'll talk about that here in the guidance. 
We had double-digit growth in material analysis and the OP margins in our industrial segment in the fourth quarter you can see were 31.4%, up 190 basis points and EBITDA hit $74.3 million at 33.8% of the revenue. 
So in guiding in 2015, we think Roper Pump share gains will support flat revenue for them in total despite a pretty steep decline in the market. 
Neptune will continue to grow in the U.S. The Toronto project completion is expected in the first half of next year. You can never put your finger exactly on that, but they have movement at the faster pace than the originally suggested. 
We've had continued -- we expect continued growth in material analysis, although you've got some currency issues with the Danish kroner, and then we've got the modest organic growth we're seeing in the segment in whole only because the Toronto RF project completion should occur sometime in the year and that could really create about a $25 million to $30 million debit in this segment on revenue, which is the bad news. But the good news is we've got another RF product that's going to offset all of that and then some that we'll talk about as we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment next. 
So next slide. So here we go into RF Technology, we'll just talk about the good news here. We were awarded the substantial contract for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia traffic management system. This will be using our trend suite software transportation management system. This is totally different controlling now. This is the stoplight transactions in Midtown Manhattan. 
There's a lot of installation management in this project, which of course is lower margin work. It's a 5-year contract to support post close. We do expect it will completely offset the Toronto wind down of Neptune even though both are RF business, one happens to record in industrial now and 1 in RF. 
So now we look at the segment as a whole, you can see the revenue was up just slightly. Total traffic infinity lane projects execution remained very strong with favorable variances both in Texas and Florida. We had terrific subscriber growth in our freight matching businesses, DIT and Get Loaded and iTrade strength in the U.S. was pretty good but unfortunately offset by U.K. weakness and problems in the U.K. with that business. 
Technolog decline, another U.K.-based software business in the utility industry, but bid activity was pretty strong and Technolog tends to be a little bit up-and-down kind of business and should be up again in 2015. 
So then if we look at the -- in addition to that OP margin at 28 4, EBITDA for the segment was $82.4 million at 34.3% and RF now represents 26% of the enterprise's EBITDA. 
In addition to the Saudi contract that was awarded, we do expect additional scope in the foreseeable future around us because Riyadh, of course, is a very important city but only one of many. 
TransCore's backlog and quote activity is going to support segment growth through 2015 and the toll tag growth that we have enjoyed recently is going to continue, particularly in Florida, Texas where people continue to migrate to our very small steeper tag as opposed to the plastic boxes that so many people in New England still use. 
software and SaaS businesses are going to continue to grow mid-single digits, very high margins, they draw up a lot of cash that allow us to make reinvestments in their own businesses or buy bolt on things for them. And the segment, we think, at the end of the year will have single-digit organic growth. 
So next, let's look at medical. I think this will be the last time in a call that we'll be able to contain medical on 1 slide. As you can see, we work very hard to try to achieve that and pretty much made it, but I don't think all that's going on there and everything we know about will allow us to do that ever again. So prepare yourself for 2 slides in 2015. 
So here we are with a very strong fourth quarter, up 12% of revenue, OP was up 15%, operating margins, 35.5% aren't the real story here. The real story here is EBITDA. 
We delivered $126.3 million in the fourth quarter in EBITDA, which was 43.9% EBITDA margin. Really, a way you have to think about the segment now is that it's medical products in one leg, it's software and service in another leg, and then the residual life science imaging component that we have in there. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9%. We had double-digit growth at MHA with share gains in favorable end markets, which continue. Sunquest growth continued. We had customer flotation that customers delayed in 2015 that we thought it's interesting, which is fine with us. 
New products at Verathon really drove spectacular growth in the fourth quarter at Verathon, and we like to think that's going to continue throughout 2015. 
Our imaging family improved somewhat with Gatan had a strong quarter, which really led that growth. And Gatan had shifted much more emphasis around life science. It used to be kind of split between physical science and life science, but with the new technologies we've introduced with the exceptions of K2 camera technology and filters, more and more life science is coming our way. 
And then the last bullet point here, SHP, which is Strategic Healthcare programs, and IPA, Innovative Products, performed really well. They're certainly on track with what we thought at the time we acquired them and probably have better forward growth than we might have guessed. 
As we think about 2015, I think you have to start with the context of understanding that MHA and Sunquest are really truly transformational for Roper. They're more transformational today than Neptune and TransCore, where in the early point of the audience. They have really great focus opportunities to build on each one of those businesses, Sunquest and MHA, including acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we can make is much broader than anything we've ever had. 
One disappointment around Neptune is it's done exceedingly well, but we haven't been able to acquire things because its competitors are less than exciting and most of the people we see in this space are not the kind of companies we want to own. I think that as Neptune has outperformed all those over these years. 
TransCore, we have been able to build out somewhat through acquisition, but mostly it's been organic growth. But Sunquest and MHA are different story. 
MHA is capturing new opportunities, it's benefiting from favorable demographics. Its acquisition and Strategic Healthcare programs was really the first addition that we've had MHA in the third quarter of 2014. We expect another one is going to happen yet within this quarter. 
Sunquest has had this moderating growth for 2015 because of the meaningful use upgrades that have been driving such high level of growth in the recent past, but our investments and eternal development, the things were doing with partners that we aren't really able to talk about yet and the opportunities that they have in front of them are really exciting. We're likely to announce another important acquisition here soon that relates to Sunquest. 
So both MHA and Sunquest, I think you'll see continued acquisitions building those very large platforms down the road. 
The Medical Device businesses are on a pretty solid growth path for 2015. We think that Verathon's going to continue to have its market share gains and product replacements going on. 
And then we just, last week, announced our first deal of the year, it won't be the last, and that's Strategic Decision Technology, which is a company run by Dan Michelson in Chicago. It's a very exciting company with a new product. It's a small company, kind of low just turned past $30 million of revenue, but they have been growing at 20% the last 3 years and now within the fusion capital from us, they're going to be able to continue to race that growth specter. And they have a new phenomenal product, which is so important for the country, around cost containment and cost improvement for hospitals. Their strategized platforms have been running at a number of hospitals in a variety of ways. But the new program that Dan and his team is going to be offering that came out to be a project that they did for Northwestern Hospital since University is really spectacular. 
In total then for the segment, we think we'll have mid- to high single-digit organic growth for the segment by the end of the year and I commit to you that we wont crowd the slide, we'll just do 2 here. 
Okay, now 2015 guidance. Here, if we turn the page. So full year guidance we establish at $6.70 and $6.94, and we put a good deal of energy into looking at this. The organic revenue growth for next year we think will be around 3% to 5%, and that's after completely adjusting for the newer macroeconomic trends that people have seen since December 30 to now. 
Operating profit leverage we can probably say will be about 40%, and that's pretty good by anybody's standards. 
Our foreign exchange rate is going to hurt us. All of our guidance is still predicated on the year-end numbers. We think that's going to cause us about $0.10, which is inside these numbers. If the dollar continue to strengthen even more, you'll have a little bit more risk. It could be as high as twice that number. If today's race lasted for the entire year, it got worse. 
The tax rate, we think will come in at around 30% to 31%. That's about a nickel headwind into the comparative earnings at the midpoint, so it could be a little higher if the tax rate got higher last year if. You remember was 29.9%. So we're hoping it will be around 30%, but it could certainly go up to 31%. 
The guidance at $6.70 and $6.94 gives you a midpoint of $6.82 is excluded in any future acquisitions that will occur or any divestures. And the full operating cash flow, we're establishing at the beginning of the year will exceed $900 million of operating cash flow for 2015 with our normally strong cash conversion. 
First quarter, we established debt at $1.47 to $1.53. It includes Strata, but it excludes another acquisition that will happen in the first quarter or any divestitures that could occur. 
Next slide. So here, we look at the 2014 summary and 2015 prospects. So Q4, we had record performance, very strong finish to a terrific year. 
For the full year, we achieved record results in all these categories, orders, revenue, net earnings EBITDA and cash flow. 
Revenue was up 9% with organic up 6%. Very significant financial achievements, sort of threshold level of activity where you see operating profit exceeded $1 billion in the company for the first time at margin at 28.2, 42% operating profit leverage. 
The EBITDA exceeded $1.2 billion for the first time and EBITDA margin got all the way up to 33.8%. 
Free cash flow was 23% of revenue, and we expanded our medical and software platforms with 3 acquisitions: Strategic Healthcare, Innovative Products and FoodLink. And these 3 deals, which are smaller than the things we've done recently are really a precursor at some of the types of outstanding businesses you're going to see us continuing to add in medical and software where they have higher growth characteristics but then to be somewhat smaller revenue businesses.  And there are a lot of these that we're involved with as we speak. 
In 2015, we expect to have record performance of Roper despite the fears around macroeconomics. We're going to deploy over $1 billion. We're very confident off in the year could easily be more than that. 
The first deal, Strata, we talked about a little bit, but it's not going to be the only deal in the first quarter, that's likely. 
I think it's important as we close out the call and get ready for the Q&A here that we are really well positioned in 2015 because the company, really, the emergence as a technology platforms and our ability to deploy capital are frankly more important than many of the macroeconomic considerations markets in so many people talked about. So we're looking forward to a great year at '15. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up to Q&A."

So that's like an additional business, it wasn't there previously. We also acquired a software control company called United Controls or CCC that offers various things that we didn't had out of CCC in terms of dealing with different types of gas turbine engine technologies on a retrofit basis.

I would say though, there are businesses that in oil and gas are spectacularly great businesses. They have EBITDA margins that are consistent with the overall enterprise EBITDA margins and pretty much our best-in-class activity. Thank goodness the vast majority of their activity is not upstream, well over 60% of those businesses are downstream and midstream, and so that helps a lot."

So you have to understand that we don't see an enormous decline, so therefore, the large installed base that we had around Compressor Controls and instrumentation for PAC, which really served the midstream and downstream markets, those will continue because those are more throughput driven. And we don't  see the 15% kind of immediate demand shock across not only that segment, but the entire world that we saw in 2009. So we want to make sure that we are very nimble in the way that we act and particularly in the upstream side where it's always a little more cyclical than the rest of the oil stream market."

So doesn't mean that they're out shopping for public companies if you see the value or something. We tend to think public companies acquisitions are problematic for the most part. I mean it could happen, but it's not where we're looking. So the only good new development in the M&A front is that there's a lot more pressure on the banks to limit their debt to EBITDA stables to 6x and 5x. And most of the last several years, debt stables have been 7, 7.5, mezzanine coming on top of it. So private equity can put in 3-year, 4 terms of other people's money and use debt extremely high leverage ratios and be very competitive in the acquisition market. So pretty much our competitors for -- when we think about who our competitors are and this is a capital employment company at its core, we look at all the large private equity guys. We love them because they own a lot of stuff that we want to acquire. But we're not willing to go up to 4 or 5 or 6x debt to EBITDA, and they start at 6 or 7x debt to EBITDA.

Unfortunately, there is never any one answer because we have a roll up here with the revenue we've shared with you 5% is upstream and 9% is midstream and downstream as well. But while our products and the markets we serve our so niche that they don't lend themselves to the same macroeconomic situation, and you see what other people where you could look at rig counts. For instance, what we haven't talked about is how much of our business is upstream oil and how much is upstream gas, how much is in the United States, how much is outside the United States. For competitive reasons we don't want to get more granular than we have, right? So we just feel that the retrofit activity that CCC does and already has booked and continues to do will have growth. The upstream portion that they have related in the new LNG projects is going to be done. And, hey, it could be down substantially beyond 20%, but it wouldn't affect us until the second half of the year because the kind of things that we do on a project basis are still rolling along. When one of our high-growth small businesses has diesel engine shut up barrels, which somebody had downstream, but it's really an upstream business. That business last year was up 16%. So we can imagine, and it could be up, so we think it's going to be down. The reversal will be more. Only fair way to answer that question is look at CapEx and other things has been so off and you had a mean of 35% or it would be 35% in the second half of the year, but maybe 15% in the first half of the year.

I mean, there's a lot of things we do, but they have been it's not broad-based, they are specific situations where developing a relationship with the government or developing a relationship with a particular agency, so that's the case in Dubai, where people who travel in and out Dubai marvel at the simplicity of all the way that traffic moves and how we see it by a tag, certainly not lost on any of the other area of country countries. All of them would like to be developed deploying these technologies. So Saudi now have this breakthrough project in Riyadh. We assume it will be wildly successful, and that will encourage them to put in change order to expand it there and hopefully over the next 10 years, we'll have a much, much larger degree of penetration around the Europe peninsula. We're very well positioned in that area to continue to grow. If you haven't had the Europe Spring, you wouldn't have seen a lot more activity that's been able to occur. In Europe, they're pretty well served today, so I don't think we're going to expand much in Europe. But in Asia, generally, we have a lot of issues around flotation. We have very few, lot, very specific boundaries. One is no foreign crop practices act and some of the people compete in this space don't seem to be bothered by that. But we're very, very conservative in that arena. So this Saudi project is a big deal. It's going to be pushing $100 million over the next several years. We expect it to be $25 million or $30 million this year to offset the Toronto wind down. On the subject of iTrade, iTrade is really doing much better now in the U.S. and FoodLink is substantially ahead of the early commitments after just a few months, so I think we made a number of improvements to their processes and they've got good leadership from their own people and our people and are supporting them. In the U.K., the Up business has been off quite a bit and the U.K. has had considerable difficulty with -- it's really not iTrade, it's an acquisition that KKR people have done just before we bought it, actually we would have never done. And it's always been problematic, and it's really more about data analytics that really ought to be owned by somebody that's in the package, good analytics arena, but we're going to try to clean it up and make it a little bit better. The end markets haven't been very favorable."

Consolidation rarely sustains growth companies. These businesses -- when private equity owns them, they always own them with an eye to [indiscernible]. So their first year, 18 months of ownership, they're happy to make investments but they've got to stop on $0.10, and they have to capitalize the leverage to get out of those investments because they've got to get rid of them in 4 or 5 years. So almost invariable when we acquire them or acquiring something that they have invested for growth for 18 months or 2-year period. And the people can't focus as much on their end markets saying growth as they can when they come here because now they can stop worrying about managing for a sale and start worrying about serving their customers and thinking clearly about where to put their resources. That's the reason that we're successful acquirers so many of these kinds of businesses. I'm sure that Barbara Strategic Healthcare could've probably frankly gotten a larger number from somebody else who would have wiped out everything she built in Santa Barbara and absorbed it because they would have wanted to cobble it together with something. And the same thing would be true in Dan's business in Chicago with Strata. So Strata's going to be a platform for us even though it's relatively small now. It's not something against cobble together with Sunquest or with MHA. And we're going to make other acquisitions, some very quickly that we'll be very complementary to an MHA, very complementary to Sunquest. So there is a lot of opportunity that we didn't have to find those kinds of things. We're always looking at great teams, great ability to grow, buying a business that's got a little over $30 million in revenue, kind of grow at 20%, it's more interesting than buying a business at $50 million revenue that can't grow at all. So we're excited about that. If you noted in Strata, that's an LLC, so one of the big things about the economics here is we got a really big tax benefit. In fact, our gross tax benefit on Strata is going to be over $40 million, so that's a major part of the consideration in the purchase price of the business. And Strata is a business that's going to have over $30 million in revenue and it's going to have EBITDA in our typical Roper kind of strategies and the purchase price was $140 million, but that included a $40 plus million of tax benefits."

So we see those as future opportunities, but we never want to have someone take their eye off the ball of the current niche focus that they have.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. That press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the SEC. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as part of this presentation, which is available on our website. 
For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consist of 2 discrete items. First, the purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue in our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and SHP, which we completed in the third quarter. That totals about $1.4 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. In addition, we had in inventory step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000.

We'll try to get this call finished before your [indiscernible] on. So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We",4388,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We'll try to get this call finished before your [indiscernible] on. 
So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We had all-time records for incoming orders revenue that we billed and net earnings EBITDA cash flow. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7%, and we had pretty much broad-based growth everyplace. Operating margins in the quarter reached 30.1%, which was up 110 basis point. And the operating leverage was pretty spectacular in the quarter at 47%. We'll comment about leverage going forward with our guidance. 
Net earnings were up 13% to $187 million or $1.85, and operating cash flow was up sharply: $1 billion run rate there at $261 million in the quarter, up 11%, with free cash flow in that same kind of category. There's very little CapEx this year, about 1% of revenue. So a very strong fourth quarter. 
Next slide. We look at the income statement here. You can the orders were up to $924 million versus $900 million a year ago, up 3%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, but -- so we said before sort of 0.97 to 1.03 is the normal spread. But in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was always very low -- relatively low because we have so much more year-end invoicing. So really, that book-to-bill at 0.98 is not a problem, and we finished the year at 1.0. 
Revenue was up 7%. We had about 2 points of negative foreign exchange headwinds here in the fourth quarter. 
Gross profit stayed at remarkably high level here, about 60%. The operating margin, as we said before, had 47% leverage. And that was just strong across the board as you'll see. 
The tax rate was about 60 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, which gave us about $0.015, so. You can see the DEPS number of $1.85 versus last year's $1.65. 
Next slide. Cash flow performance in the quarter was spectacular. We had 140% operating cash flow conversion and 136% free cash flow conversion. Our cash flow has been growing. As you can see, if you look at 2012, and then '13 and '14, that's an 11% CAGR on operating cash flow the last 2 years. And our free cash flow was 23% of revenue, which is about same as last year's 23% of revenue. Pretty spectacular number. 
We still think cash is the best measure of performance. And I think if you follow our free cash flow and you follow the continued growth, then you can get a much better understanding about the quality of the company's businesses. 
Here, we start the full year enterprise results, next slide. If we look at the full year income statement, orders were above $3.5 billion. They were up 5% and the book-to-bill was exactly 1.0. 
The revenue was up 9% with organic, up 6% for the year, which was certainly in the wheelhouse of what we established as guidance at the beginning of the year. Gross margin for the full year was up 70 basis points to 59.3% and our operating margin was up 120 basis points. And for the full year, we had operating leverage of 42%. We used to talk about, well, I can go back to 25% to 30%, and then it was 30% to 35%. And recently, it's been 35% to 40%. And we're going to suggest that forward guidance for us is going to have operating leverage at 40% or above on the next dollar of revenue. 
Operating income was up 13%. The earnings before tax were up 16%. Tax was a headwind for us this year as we suggested it would be at the beginning of the year. It was 29.9% versus 29% last year. That caused an $0.08 headwind in our earnings. But even with that $0.08, we still produced $6.42, up 14%. And the GAAP number, of course, was up 19% on earnings per share. 
Next slide. In terms of EBITDA and margin, on the left-hand side, you'll see EBITDA has increased over the last 2 years by 30% from $925 million in 2012 to $1.2 billion this year. That's a $276 million increase. 
On EBITDA margins, we continued to improve margins, I think, rather spectacularly. 2012, our EBITDA was 30.8% and people were saying, ""Oh boy, you're going to have to revert to the mean now. You'll be back down with everybody else in the 20s."" Well, of course, quite to the contrary, that's just wrong. They were at 32.8% last year and 33.8% this year, and that's all about our governance system and the quality of our businesses, record EBITDA performance. 
Next slide. Here, again, you see a tribute to the governance model, what we have, and the field execution. Our asset-light business model inventory now running 5.1%, receivables at 16.1%. And the way we look at the working capital number, you can see it's dropped from 7% 2 years ago, when people thought that was an unbelievably good number, to now 5% at the end of this year. So our guys continue to understand how to execute our asset-light business model. 
Next slide. We look at the strong financial position and the balance sheet of the company. It's certainly a powerful balance sheet with a lot of powder that we intend to use. You can see that cash has gone up to $610 million. Now a lot of that's not in the U.S., but our cash and undrawn revolver gives us a $2.1 billion capacity. The trailing 12 months EBITDA now has gone up to $1.2 billion, so our gross debt number at $2.2 billion is 1.8x our EBITDA, and we're going to be quite comfortable if it's at least a turn higher. We'll discuss our activity that's going to be occurring in the first quarter and throughout the year later, but we still believe we're going to deploy about $8 billion over the next 5 years in transactions. 
Next slide. We'll get into the specific detail now on the segment. If we look first at the revenue growth by segment last year, you'll see in the left-hand side on our organic basis, Energy was up 5%; Industrial Technology, half of which is Neptune, was up 7%. Our Radio Frequency was up 5% and Medical was up 8%. If we look at the total revenue growth by segment, you'll see Medical was up 16% as the acquisitions added to the organic number. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the overall segment performance on $1.00 value and EBITDA basis so that you can get some better clarity on the fact that RF and Medical represents about 2/3 of our total EBITDA progression. And it's well over half of our revenue now. So the original sort of Energy business is the smallest segment we have at $692 million, still outstanding performance, with $226 million of EBITDA in the larger section. First time, I think, we've ever had $1 billion segment in Roper. So you now have Medical with $1,082 million in revenue, pretty good solid stand-alone entity, with $472 million in EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the oil and gas component of the company, the legacy of the company was oil and gas. And up until through 2007, it was a pretty big portion in the overall company. 
Today, it's a very, very small portion. Our upstream represents 5%. Our Medical, RF and software, water markets are 86% of the company. And the downstream, midstream, which is actually going to have modest growth this year, is about 9%. 
Now what the slide's showing you, in addition to the breakout here, our upstream business is about 5% of revenue. Some of that's in the Energy sector and some is in the Industrial Technology sector, where Roper Pump resides. We have -- even though the market, we think, will be down 20%, perhaps even a little bit more -- or we have a benefit in that Roper Pump has these technologies that we launched and the new facility to get broader categories of those into the marketplace quickly in Houston a year ago. Well, those shipments didn't really start to occur until the second half of the year in any level. So we have an easy comp with the first half of 2015 in those products in which we're gaining share, so that will mitigate what normally would have been a deeper decline in upstream. 
And our field service and retrofit activity in midstream is actually continuing to move up a little bit. And then we have the refinery instrumentation businesses in the field service associated with that also, which will have modest growth. 
One of the things we did in December is we had all of our oil and gas people in for a couple-a-day meeting where we did a focused review to recast what they had originally submitted for 2015 projections. We had them bridge the risk by customer and by category, by product line. We reviewed the contingency plans and the triggers that they had in place. These guys are world class and nimble execution as they need to do stuff. They'd made a few changes already and are monitoring activity routinely. In fact, Friday, we had a dust up on exactly where we were January to date. I'd have to say that the momentum is actually as good as it was in the fourth quarter. We really aren't seeing anything related to product falloff at all. It's above our expectation through the first 3 weeks of January, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But there has not been any early indicator yet, other than project delays and what you hear from other people, who aren't really determining their CapEx plans till later. But most of our products are not going into CapEx-driven activity. 
The guidance that we've established and we'll talk about reflects the up-to-date business expectations of all of our oil and gas people as of January 23. And as I stated, our product activity hasn't slowed. 
The other thing, I think, as I've read some of the commentary about the company is people thinking that there's some way to ascertain something that happened in 2008 or 2009 for our company. And I guess, we just failed to do a good enough job to remind people who we are. 
If you look at 2008, we added CBORD in February, and then later in the year, we added Horizon and Getloaded and Tech-Pro, 3 software companies. And those weren't in full year for '08. And then if you look at our acquisition since '08, where people are doing comparisons, we've added United Toll, which is a software system that's driving so much of our growth in TransCore; The iTradeNetwork; Verathon; Northern Digital medical; Ascension medical; Managed Health Care Associates; Sunquest, Strategic Healthcare Programs, last year; Innovative Product Achievements, last year; FoodLink and now Strata Decision Technology. All these are either medical or software companies that created over $1 billion of revenue that's in our numbers today that wasn't there in 2007. So to say there's some quid pro quo on this just belies the reality of who we are and what we've become. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the Energy Systems & Controls sector. We can tell you that there's about $125 million of revenue upstream out of our total Energy Systems & Controls business. You can see in the fourth quarter, their operating profit was up 11%. Their OP margin reached 36.1%, up 280 basis points. And EBITDA for Energy in the fourth quarter was 39%. Organic revenue was up 4%. We had very significant strength, really, in these -- some of the businesses that people think are going backwards, which as far as now, we're not. So our diesel engine shut-off safety systems was up in the high teens, and so was vibration monitoring. Field service growth continued. But we did see project activity declining at CCC or postponed, so that's something that we'll be watching carefully throughout 2015. 
As we look at guidance establishing for next year, we look at upstream declining, which is about 20% of the revenue in the segment. And then we think the midstream and downstream will have very modest growth. And that represents about 40% of the total segment. And then the non-oil and gas businesses are another 40% of the Energy Systems & Controls segment. So when we net it all together with declines in the upstream, modest growth in the non-oil and gas arena, this segment, we think, will come in flat to modest organic growth for the year. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at Industrial Technology. In Industrial Technology, we have about $75 million of upstream revenue in the entire segment. And oil and gas sort of split a little bit between the upstream. Not much downstream in the segment, maybe another $25 million at the most. 
Here, you can see that organic growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, broad based throughout the different businesses in this segment. Our Roper Pump had all-time performance records. They continue to win new customers with the newer technology. And the product investments that we made over the last 2 years have really driven substantial revenue growth and certainly help us as we get the end-market falloff in that activity. 
We had growth at Neptune, driven by strength in the U.S. market. We're starting to see the Toronto project wind down and we'll talk about that here in the guidance. We had double-digit growth in material analysis and the OP margins in our Industrial segment in the fourth quarter, you can see, were 31.4%, up 190 basis points. And EBITDA hit $74.3 million at 33.8% of the revenue. 
So in guiding in 2015, we think Roper Pump share gains will support flat revenue for them in total, despite a pretty steep decline in the market. Neptune, we think will continue to grow in the U.S. The Toronto project completion is expected in the first half of next year. You can never put your finger exactly on that, but they have been moving at a faster pace than they originally suggested. 
We've had continued -- we expect continued growth in material analysis, although you've got some currency issues with the Danish kroner. And then we've got the modest organic growth we're seeing in the segment in whole, only because the Toronto RF project completion should occur some time in the year. And that could really create about a $25 million to $30 million divot in this segment on revenue, which is the bad news. But the good news is we've got another RF product that's going to offset all of that and then some that we'll talk about as we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment next. 
So next slide. So here we go into RF Technology. We'll just talk about the good news here. We were awarded a substantial contract for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia traffic management system. This will be using our Transsuite software transportation management system. This is totally different than trolling now. This is the stoplight transactions in Midtown Manhattan. There's a lot of installation management in this project, which, of course, is lower-margin work. It's a 5-year contract to support it post-close. We do expect it will completely offset the Toronto wind down of Neptune. Even though both are RF business, one happens to report in Industrial now and one in RF. 
So now we look at the segment as a whole. You can see the revenue was up just slightly. Toll and traffic infinity lane projects execution remain very strong with favorable variances, both in Texas and Florida. We had terrific subscriber growth in our freight matching businesses, DAT and GetLoaded. And iTrade strength in the U.S. was pretty good but unfortunately offset by U.K. weakness and problems in the U.K. with that business. Technolog declined, another U.K.-based software business in the utility industry. But bid activity was pretty strong and Technolog tends to be a little bit up-and-down kind of business and should be up again in 2015. 
So then if we look at the -- in addition to that OP margin at 28.4%, EBITDA for the segment was $82.4 million at 34.3%. And RF now represents 26% of the enterprise's EBITDA. 
In addition to the Saudi contract that was awarded, we do expect additional scope in the foreseeable future around us because Riyadh, of course, a very important city but only one of many. TransCore's backlog and quote activity is going to support segment growth through 2015. And the toll tag growth that we have enjoyed recently is going to continue, particularly in Florida, Texas where people continue to migrate to our very small sticker tag as opposed to the plastic boxes that so many people in New England still use. 
Software and SaaS businesses are going to continue to grow mid-single digits, very high margins. They draw up a lot of cash that allow us to make reinvestments in their own businesses or buy bolt-on things for them. And the segment, we think, at the end of the year, will have mid-single-digit organic growth. 
So next, let's look at Medical. I think this will be the last time in a call that we'll be able to contain Medical on one slide. As you can see, we work very hard to try to achieve that and pretty much made it, but I don't think all that's going on there and everything we know about will allow us to do that ever again. So prepare yourself for 2 slides in 2015. 
So here we are with a very strong fourth quarter, up 12% of revenue. OP was up 15%. Operating margins, 35.5%, aren't the real story here. The real story here is EBITDA. We delivered $126.3 million in the fourth quarter in EBITDA, which was 43.9% EBITDA margin. Really, a way you have to think about this segment now is that it's medical products in one leg, it's software and service in another leg, and then the residual life science imaging component that we have in there. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9%. We had double-digit growth at MHA, with share gains in favorable end markets, which continue. Sunquest growth continued. We had some customer implementation that customers delayed into 2015, that we thought was interesting, which is fine with us. New products at Verathon really drove spectacular growth in the fourth quarter at Verathon, and we like to think that's going to continue throughout 2015. 
Our imaging family improved somewhat with -- Gatan had a strong quarter, which really led that growth. And Gatan had shifted much more emphasis around life science. It used to be kind of split between physical science and life science, but with the new technologies we've introduced and the acceptance of the K2 camera technology and filters, more and more life science is coming our way. 
And in it -- in the last bullet point here, SHP, which is Strategic Healthcare Programs; and IPA, Innovative Products, performed really well. They're certainly on track with what we thought at the time they acquired them and probably have better forward growth than we might have guessed. 
As we think about 2015, I think you have to start with the context of understanding that MHA and Sunquest are really truly transformational for Roper. They're more transformational today than Neptune and TransCore were in the early point of the audies [ph]. They have really great, focused opportunities to build on each one of those businesses, Sunquest and MHA, including acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we can make is much broader than anything we've ever had. 
One disappointment around Neptune is it's done exceedingly well, but we haven't been able to acquire things because its competitors are less than exciting and most of the people we see in this space are not the kind of companies we'd want to own. I think that as Neptune has outperformed all those over these years. 
TransCore, we have been able to build out somewhat through acquisition, but mostly it's been organic growth. But Sunquest and MHA are a different story. 
MHA is capturing new opportunities. It's benefiting from favorable demographics. Its acquisition of Strategic Healthcare Programs was really the first addition that we've had to MHA in the third quarter of 2014. We expect another one's going to happen yet within this quarter. 
Sunquest has had this moderating growth for 2015 because of the meaningful use upgrades that have been driving such high level of growth in the recent past, but our investments in internal development, the things we're doing with partners that we aren't really able to talk about yet, and the opportunities that they have in front of them are really exciting. We're likely to announce another important acquisition here soon that relates to Sunquest. So both MHA and Sunquest, I think you'll see continued acquisitions building those very large platforms down the road. 
The medical device businesses are on a pretty solid growth path for 2015. We think that Verathon's going to continue to have its market share gains and product replacements going on. 
And then we just, last week, announced our first deal of the year. It won't be the last, and that's Strategic Decision Technology, which is a company run by Dan Michelson in Chicago. It's a very exciting company with a new product. It's a small company, kind of low -- just turned past $30 million of revenue. But they've been growing at 20% the last 3 years and now with an infusion of capital from us, they're going to be able to continue to raise that growth specter. And they have a new phenomenal product, which is so important for the country, around cost containment and cost improvement for hospitals. Their StrataJazz platform's been running a number of hospitals in a variety of ways. But the new programs Dan and his team are going to be offering, that came out of a project that they did for Northwestern hospital's university is really spectacular. 
In total then, for the segment, we think we'll have mid- to high single-digit organic growth for the segment by the end of the year. And I commit to you that we won't crowd the slide. We'll just do 2 in the future. 
Okay, now 2015 guidance. Here, if we turn the page. So full year guidance, we establish at $6.70 and $6.94, and we put a good deal of energy into looking at this. The organic revenue growth for next year we think will be around 3% to 5%, and that's after completely adjusting for the newer macroeconomic trends that people have seen since December 30 to now. Operating profit leverage, we can probably say will be above 40%, and that's pretty good by anybody's standards. 
Our foreign exchange rate is going to hurt us. We -- all of our guidance is still predicated on the year-end numbers. We think that's going to cost us about $0.10, which is inside these numbers. If the dollar continued to strengthen even more, you'd have a little bit more risk. It could be as high as twice that number. If today's rates lasted for the entire year, it got worse. 
The tax rate, we think will come in around 30% to 31%. That's about a $0.05 headwind into the comparative earnings at the midpoint. So it could be a little higher if the tax rate got higher last year. If you remember, it was 29.9%. So we're hoping it'll be around 30%, but it could certainly go up to 31%. 
The guidance at $6.70 and $6.94 gives you a midpoint of $6.82, is -- excludes any future acquisitions that will occur or any divestures. And the full operating cash flow we're establishing at the beginning of the year, would exceed $900 million of operating cash flow for 2015 with our normally strong cash conversion. 
First quarter, we established DEPS at $1.47 to $1.53. It includes Strata, but it excludes any other acquisitions that will happen in the first quarter or any divestitures that could occur. 
Next slide. So here, we look at the 2014 summary and 2015 prospects. So Q4, we had record performance, very strong finish to a terrific year. 
For the full year, we achieved record results in all these categories: orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Revenue was up 9% with organic up 6%. Very significant financial achievements, sort of threshold level of activity where you see operating profit exceeded $1 billion in the company for the first time. Margin at 28.2, 42% operating profit leverage. The EBITDA exceeded $1.2 billion for the first time and EBITDA margin got all the way up to 33.8%. Free cash flow was 23% of revenue, and we expanded our Medical and software platforms with 3 acquisitions of Strategic Healthcare, Innovative Products and FoodLink. And these 3 deals, which are smaller than the things we've done recently are really a precursor of some of the types of outstanding businesses you're going to see us continuing to add in Medical and software, where they have higher growth characteristics but then to be somewhat smaller-revenue businesses. And there are a lot of these that we're involved with as we speak. 
In 2015, we expect to have record performance of Roper, despite the fears around macroeconomics. We're going to deploy over $1 billion, we're very confident of in the year. It could easily be more than that. The first deal, Strata, we talked about a little bit. But it's not going to be the only deal in the first quarter. That's likely. 
I think it's important as we close out the call and get ready for the Q&A here that we are really well positioned in 2015. Because the company, really, the emergence as a technology platforms and our ability to deploy capital are frankly, more important than many of the macroeconomic considerations in markets that so many people talked about. So we're looking forward to a great year at '15. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up to Q&A."

It doesn't require rig count or anything else. And we hadn't had that technology in 2008. That's only just appeared, really, in 2013 and '14. So that's like an additional business that wasn't there previously. We also acquired a software control company called United Controls or CCC, that offers various things that we didn't have out of CCC in terms of dealing with different types of gas turbine engine technologies on a retrofit basis. And that's useful. We had online software that we added to our PAC business: Cambridge Viscosity and Trinity software for CCC. So we've got some things that continue to grow and aren't related to rig counts and upstream activity, so that's good. 
I would say though, that our businesses that in oil and gas are spectacularly great businesses. They have EBITDA margins that are consistent with the overall enterprise EBITDA margins and pretty much are best-in-class activity. Thank goodness the vast majority of their activity is not upstream. Well over 60% of those businesses are downstream and midstream, and so that helps a lot."

And we don't see the 15% kind of immediate demand shock across, not only that segment, but the entire world that we saw in 2009.

So it's -- they're not really driven by some aggregate number about demography or a medical market. 
Then if you get to our Sunquest and MHA businesses, which were software and software like, they're -- they have a lot of demography benefits. I mean, there's going to be more testing, not less testing. There's going to be more needs for post-acute care. There's going to be more activity around hospice and nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities and all those things that MHA does so well.

If you look then at the life science business, that business, Gatan has sort of preemptive technology related to filtering and camera technology for life science, things -- if you're looking at molecular biology, so it's a great space.

So the only good new development in the M&A front is that there's a lot more pressure on the banks to limit their debt-to-EBITDA staples to 6x or 5x. And most of the last several years, debt staples have been 7, 7.5, mezzanine coming on top of it. So private equity can put in 3-year, 4 terms of other people's money and use debt at extremely high leverage ratios and be very competitive in the acquisition market. So pretty much, our competitors for -- when we think about who our competitors are and, this is a capital deployment company at its core, we look at all the large private equity guys. We love them because they own a lot of stuff we want to acquire. But we're not willing to go up to 4 or 5 or 6x debt to EBITDA, and they start at 6 or 7x debt to EBITDA.

But while the -- our products and the markets we serve are so niche that they don't lend themselves to the same macroeconomic situation that you see with other people where you could look at rig counts. 
For instance, what we haven't talked about is how much of our business is upstream oil and how much is upstream gas, how much is in the United States, how much is outside the United States. And we, for competitive reasons, don't want to get more granular than we have, right? So we just feel that the retrofit activity that CCC does and already has booked and continues to do will have growth. 
The upstream portion that they have related in a new LNG project, is going to be down. And hey, it could be down substantially beyond 20%, but it wouldn't affect us until the second half of the year, because the kind of things that we do on a project basis are still rolling along. 
When -- one of our high-growth small businesses is diesel engine shut-off barrels, which somebody had downstream, but it's really an upstream business. That business last year was up 16%. So we can imagine that it could be up, so we think it's going to be down. The reversal will be more. 
So about the only fair way to answer the question is, what if CapEx and other things fell off and you had a vee of 35%, our view would be it would be 35% in the second half of the year, but maybe 15% in the first half of the year. So I think those people who are writing about fears in 2016, they were reading everything everybody's writing.

These are mostly test-and-assembly businesses. There are only a few things we do that involve machining operations. So a downturn to us is a lot different than a downturn to GE's oil and gas businesses."

And with respect to hedging, I mean, you can change that timing, but you can't change the magnitude. Eventually -- unless someone's figured out a way to hedge for the next 20 years, they know what currencies are going to do, you can hedge for a little while. But those are folks that are really more plan driven and have much longer cycles than I think our company does. 
And so as we look at the sensitivity, I think Brian's already mentioned the fact that we are expecting a little bit less than 2% headwind from an FX standpoint for 2015. That translates to about $0.10, so we'll have to see what the future holds."

We've got a great Industrial and Energy business that throws off a massive amount of cash that provides a wonderful annuity for us to go out and maintain an investment-grade status and acquire a lot of great software and medical businesses.

When there's a confluence of reports that you see out there, I think they fundamentally keep talking about how are you trading as a premium to among the industry, or if it seems so high. When in reality, it's pitifully low against who we actually compete against for market capital. So at some point in time, if that doesn't get recognized better than it does from time to time, there's always flexibility in what we would do. But we're going to keep building out our situation. 
Now we started from next to nothing to create $1 billion Medical and software company. Our RF business is largely a software company. And Industrial with Neptune -- Neptune's not really Industrial, it's really Radio Frequency. It just reports over there.

I mean, there's a lot of things we do, but they have been -- it's not broad based. They're specific situations. We're developing a relationship with the government or developing a relationship with a particular agency. So that's the case in Dubai. Well, people travel in and out of Dubai, marvel at the simplicity of all of the way that traffic moves and how easy it is to buy a tag. It's certainly not lost on any of the other Arab countries. All of them would like to be deploying these technologies. So the Saudi's now have this breakthrough project in Riyadh. We assume it'll be wildly successful, and that'll encourage them to put in change orders to expand it there. And hopefully over the next 10 years, we'll have a much, much larger degree of penetration around the Arab peninsula. We're very well positioned in that area to continue to grow. And if you hadn't had the Arab Spring, you would've seen a lot more activity than has been able to occur. 
In Europe, they're pretty well served today, so I don't think we're going to expand much in Europe. And Asia, generally, we have a lot of issues when you get to around deportation. We have very few -- a lot very specific boundaries. One is no Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and some of the people who compete in this space don't seem to be bothered by that. But we're very, very conservative in that arena. 
So this Saudi project is a big deal. It's going to be pushing $100 million over the next several years. And we expect it to be $25 million or $30 million this year to offset the Toronto wind down. 
On the subject of iTrade, iTrade's really doing much better now in the U.S. And FoodLink is substantially ahead of the early commitments after just a few months, so I think we made a number of improvements to their processes. And they've got good leadership from their own people and our people that are supporting them. 
In the U.K., the pump business has been off quite a bit and the U.K.'s had considerable difficulty with -- it's really not iTrade. It's an acquisition that the KKR people had done just before we bought it, which we would have never done. And it's always been problematic, and it's really more about data analytics. It really ought to be owned by somebody that's in the packaged good analytics arena. But we're going to try to clean it up and make it a little bit better. The end markets haven't been very favorable."

We're not uncobblers here. Consolidation rarely sustains growth companies. These businesses -- when private equity owns them, they always own them with an eye to exit. So their first year, 18 months of ownership, they're happy to make investments but they got to stop on a dime, and they have to capitalize the leverage they get out of those investments, because they've got to get rid of them in 4 or 5 years. So almost invariable, when we acquire them, we're acquiring something that has been underinvested in for growth for a 18-month or 2-year period. And the people can't focus as much on their end market's growth as they can when they come here, because now they can stop worrying about managing for a sale and start worrying about serving their customers and thinking clearly about where to put their resources. That's the reason that we're the successful acquirers of so many of these kinds of businesses. 
I'm sure that Barbara in Strategic Healthcare could've probably, frankly, gotten a larger number from somebody else who would've wiped out everything she built in Santa Barbara and absorbed it, because they would have wanted to cobble it together with something. 
And the same thing would be true in Dan's business in Chicago with Strata. So Strata's going to be a platform for us, even though it's relatively small now. It's not something that gets cobbled together with Sunquest or with MHA. And we're going to make other acquisitions, some very quickly, that will be very complementary to an MHA and very complementary to Sunquest. So there is a lot of opportunity that we didn't have to find those kinds of things. 
We're always looking for great teams, great ability to grow. Buying a business that's got a little over $30 million in revenue, kind of grow it at 20%, is more interesting than buying a business at $50 million revenue that can't grow at all. So we're excited about that. 
If you noted in Strata, that's an LLC. So the big -- one of the big things about the economics here is we get a really big tax benefit. In fact, our gross tax benefit on Strata's going to be over $40 million. So that's a major part of the consideration in the purchase price of the business. And Strata's a business that's going to have over $30 million of revenue and it's going to have EBITDA in our typical Roper kind of strategies. And the purchase price was $140 million, but that included $40-plus million of tax benefits."

It's always a balance for us. We think there is incredible value in having a business focused on its niche and on its existing customers, particularly one with -- that has so much runway and ability to capture opportunities like Strata. But we do see the ability to have Strata work with, maybe, another market opportunity that MHA may have. So we see those as future opportunities, but we never want to have someone take their eye off the ball of the current niche focus that they have.

As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. In addition, we had in inventory step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000.

So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year, with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We had all-time records for incoming orders, the revenue that we billed, the net earnings EBITDA cash flow. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7%, and we had pretty much broad-based growth everyplace. Operating margins in the quarter reached 30.1%, which was up 110 basis point. And the operating leverage was pretty spectacular in the quarter at 47%. We'll comment about leverage going forward with our guidance. 
Net earnings were up 13% to 800 and -- about $187 million, or $1.85; and operating cash flow was up sharply, $1 billion run rate there, at $261 million in the quarter, up 11%, with free cash flow in that same kind of category. There's very little CapEx this year, about 1% of revenue. So a very strong fourth quarter. 
Next slide. When you look at the income statement here, you can the orders were up to $924 million versus $900 million a year ago, up 3%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, but -- so we said before, sort of 0.97 to 1.03 is the normal spread. But in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was always very low -- relatively low because we have so much more year-end invoicing. So really, that book-to-bill of 0.98 is not a problem, and we finished the year at 1.0. 
Revenue was up 7%. We had about 2 points of negative foreign exchange headwinds here in the fourth quarter. 
Gross profit stayed at a remarkably high level here, about 60%. The operating margin, as we said before, had 47% leverage. And that was just strong across the board, as you'll see. 
The tax rate was about 60 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, which gave us about $0.015, So you can see the DEPS number of $1.85 versus last year's $1.65. 
Next slide. Cash flow performance in the quarter was spectacular. We had 140% operating cash flow conversion and 136% free cash flow conversion. Our cash flow has been growing. As you can see, if you look at 2012, and then '13 and '14, that's an 11% CAGR on operating cash flow the last 2 years. And our free cash flow was 23% of revenue, which is about same as last year's 23% of revenue. Pretty spectacular number. 
We still think cash is the best measure of performance. And I think if you follow our free cash flow and you follow the continued growth in it, you can get a much better understanding about the quality of the company's businesses. 
Here, we start the full year enterprise results. Next slide. If we look at the full year income statement, orders were above $3.5 billion. They were up 5% and the book-to-bill was exactly 1.0. 
The revenue was up 9% with organic, up 6% for the year, which was certainly in the wheelhouse of what we established as guidance at the beginning of the year. Gross margin for the full year was up 70 basis points to 59.3%, and our operating margin was up 120 basis points. And for the full year, we had operating leverage of 42%. We used to talk about, well, I can go back to 25% to 30%, and then it was 30% to 35%. And recently, it's been 35% to 40%. And we're going to suggest that forward guidance for us is going to have operating leverage at 40% or above on the next dollar of revenue. 
Operating income was up 13%. The earnings before tax were up 16%. Tax was a headwind for us this year, as we suggested it would be at the beginning of the year. It was 29.9% versus 29% last year. That caused an $0.08 headwind in our earnings. But even with that $0.08, we still produced $6.42, up 14%. And the GAAP number, of course, was up 19% on earnings per share. 
Next slide. In terms of EBITDA and margin, on the left-hand side, you'll see EBITDA has increased over the last 2 years by 30%, from $925 million in 2012 to $1.2 billion this year. That's a $276 million increase. 
On EBITDA margins. We continued to improve margins, I think, rather spectacularly. 2012, our EBITDA was 30.8% and people were saying, ""Oh boy, you're going to have to revert to the mean now. You'll be back down with everybody else in the 20s."" Well, of course, quite to the contrary, that's just wrong. They were at 32.8% last year and 33.8% this year, and that's all about our governance system and the quality of our businesses, record EBITDA performance. 
Next slide. Here, again, you see a tribute to the governance model, what we have, and the field execution. Our asset-light business model inventory now running 5.1%, receivables at 16.1%. And the way we look at the working capital number, you can see it's dropped from 7% 2 years ago, when people thought that was an unbelievably good number, to now 5% at the end of this year. So our guys continue to understand how to execute our asset-light business model. 
Next slide. We look at the strong financial position and the balance sheet of the company. It's certainly a powerful balance sheet with a lot of powder that we intend to use. You can see that the cash has gone up to $610 million. Now a lot of that's not in the U.S., but our cash and undrawn revolver gives us a $2.1 billion capacity. The trailing 12 months EBITDA now has gone up to $1.2 billion, so our gross debt number at $2.2 billion is 1.8x our EBITDA, and we're going to be quite comfortable if it's at least a turn higher. We'll discuss our activity that's going to be occurring in the first quarter and throughout the year later, but we still believe we're going to deploy about $8 billion over the next 5 years in transactions. 
Next slide. We'll get into the specific detail now on the segment. If we look first at the revenue growth by segment last year, you'll see in the left-hand side on our organic basis, Energy was up 5%; Industrial Technology, half of which is Neptune, was up 7%. Our Radio Frequency was up 5% and Medical was up 8%. If we look at the total revenue growth by segment, you'll see Medical was up 16% as the acquisitions added to the organic number. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the overall segment performance on a dollar value and EBITDA basis so that you can get some better clarity on the fact that RF and Medical represents about 2/3 of our total EBITDA progression. And it's well over half of our revenue now. So the original sort of Energy business is the smallest segment we have, at $692 million. Still outstanding performance, with $226 million of EBITDA in the larger section. First time, I think, we've ever had $1 billion segment in Roper. So you now have Medical with $1,082 million in revenue, pretty good solid stand-alone entity, with $472 million in EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the oil and gas component of the company, the legacy of the company was oil and gas. And up until through 2007, it was a pretty big portion in the overall company. 
Today, it's a very, very small portion. Our upstream represents 5%. Our Medical, RF and software, water markets are 86% of the company. And the downstream, midstream, which is actually going to have modest growth this year, is about 9%. 
Now what the slide's showing you, in addition to the breakout here, our upstream business is about 5% of revenue. Some of that's in the Energy sector and some is in the Industrial Technology sector, where Roper Pump resides. We have -- even though the market, we think, will be down 20%, perhaps even a little bit more -- or we have a benefit in that Roper Pump has these technologies that we launched and the new facility to get broader categories of those into the marketplace quickly in Houston a year ago, well, those shipments didn't really start to occur until the second half of the year in any level. So we have an easy comp, with the first half of 2015 in those products in which we're gaining share, so that will mitigate what normally would have been a deeper decline in upstream. 
And our field service and retrofit activity in midstream is actually continuing to move up a little bit. And then we have the refinery instrumentation businesses in the field service associated with that also, which will have modest growth. 
One of the things we did in December is we had all of our oil and gas people in for a couple-a-day meeting, where we did a focused review to recast what they had originally submitted for 2015 projections. We had them bridge the risk by customer and by category, by product line. We reviewed the contingency plans and the triggers that they had in place. These guys are world class and nimble execution as they need to do stuff. They've made a few changes already and are monitoring activity routinely. In fact, Friday, we had a dust up on exactly where we were January to date. I'd have to say that the momentum is actually as good as it was in the fourth quarter. We really aren't seeing anything related to product falloff at all. It's above our expectation through the first 3 weeks of January, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But there has not been any early indicator yet, other than project delays and what you hear from other people who aren't really determining their CapEx plans till later. But most of our products are not going into CapEx-driven activity. 
The guidance that we've established and we'll talk about reflects the up-to-date business expectations of all of our oil and gas people as of January 23. And as I say, the product activity hasn't slowed. 
The other thing, I think, as I've read some of the commentary about the company, is people thinking that there's some way to ascertain something that happened in 2008 or 2009 for our company. And I guess we just failed to do a good enough job to remind people who we are. 
If you look at 2008, we added CBORD in February, and then later in the year, we added Horizon and Getloaded and Technolog, 3 software companies. And those weren't in full year for '08. And then if you look at our acquisition since '08, where people are doing comparisons, we've added United Toll, which is a software system that's driving so much of our growth in TransCore; The iTradeNetwork; Verathon; Northern Digital medical; Ascension medical; Managed Health Care Associates; Sunquest; Strategic Healthcare Programs last year; Innovative Product Achievements last year; FoodLink and now Strata Decision Technology. All these are either medical or software companies that created over $1 billion of revenue that's in our numbers today that wasn't there in 2007. So to say there's some quid pro quo on this just belies the reality of who we are and what we've become. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the Energy Systems & Controls sector, we can tell you that there's about $125 million of revenue upstream out of our total Energy Systems & Controls business. You can see in the fourth quarter, their operating profit was up 11%. Their OP margin reached 36.1%, up 280 basis points. And EBITDA for Energy in the fourth quarter was 39%. Organic revenue was up 4%. We had very significant strength, really, in these -- some of the businesses that people think are going backwards, which as far as now, are not. So our diesel engine shut-off safety systems was up in the high teens, and so was vibration monitoring. Field service growth continued. But we did see project activity declining at CCC, or postponement, so that's something that we'll be watching carefully throughout 2015. 
As we look at guidance establishing for next year, we look at upstream declining, which is about 20% of the revenue in this segment. And then we think the midstream and downstream will have very modest growth. And that represents about 40% of the total segment. And then the non-oil and gas businesses are another 40% of the Energy Systems & Controls segment. So when we net it all together with declines in the upstream, modest growth in the non-oil and gas arena, this segment, we think, will come in flat to modest organic growth for the year. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at Industrial Technology. In Industrial Technology, we have about $75 million of upstream revenue in the entire segment. And oil and gas sort of split a little bit between the upstream. Not much downstream in the segment, maybe another $25 million at the most. 
Here, you can see that organic growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, broad based throughout the different businesses in this segment. Our Roper Pump had all-time performance records. They continue to win new customers with the newer technology. And the product investments that we made over the last 2 years have really driven substantial revenue growth and certainly help us as we get the end-market falloff in that activity. 
We had growth at Neptune, driven by strength in the U.S. market. We're starting to see the Toronto project wind down and we'll talk about that here in the guidance. We had double-digit growth in material analysis and the OP margins in our Industrial segment in the fourth quarter, you can see, were 31.4%, up 190 basis points. And EBITDA hit $74.3 million at 33.8% of the revenue. 
So in guiding in 2015, we think Roper Pump share gains will support flat revenue for them in total, despite a pretty steep decline in the market. Neptune, we think will continue to grow in the U.S. The Toronto project completion is expected in the first half of next year. You can never put your finger exactly on that, but they have been moving at a faster pace than they originally suggested. 
We've had continued -- we expect continued growth in material analysis, although you've got some currency issues with the Danish kroner. And then we've got the modest organic growth we're seeing in the segment in whole, only because the Toronto RF project completion should occur sometime in the year. And that could really create about a $25 million to $30 million divot in this segment on revenue, which is the bad news. But the good news is we've got another RF product that's going to offset all of that and then some that we'll talk about as we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment next. 
So next slide. So here we go into RF Technology. We'll just talk about the good news here. We were awarded a substantial contract for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia traffic management system. This will be using our Transsuite software transportation management system. This is totally different than trolling now. This is the stoplight transactions in Midtown Manhattan. There's a lot of installation management in this project, which, of course, is lower-margin work. It's a 5-year contract to support it post-close. We do expect it will completely offset the Toronto wind down of Neptune. Even though both are RF business, one happens to report in Industrial now and one in RF. 
So now we look at the segment as a whole. You can see the revenue was up just slightly. Toll and traffic infinity lane projects execution remain very strong, with favorable variances both in Texas and Florida. We had terrific subscriber growth in our freight matching businesses, DAT and Getloaded. And iTrade strength in the U.S. was pretty good but unfortunately offset by U.K. weakness and problems in the U.K. with that business. Technolog declined, another U.K.-based software business in the utility industry. But bid activity was pretty strong and Technolog tends to be a little bit an up-and-down kind of business and should be up again in 2015. 
So then if we look at the -- in addition to that OP margin at 28.4%, EBITDA for the segment was $82.4 million at 34.3%. And RF now represents 26% of the enterprise's EBITDA. 
In addition to the Saudi contract that was awarded, we do expect additional scope in the foreseeable future around us because Riyadh, of course, a very important city but only one of many. TransCore's backlog and quote activity is going to support segment growth through 2015. And the toll tag growth that we have enjoyed recently is going to continue, particularly in Florida and Texas where people continue to migrate to our very small sticker tag as opposed to the plastic boxes that so many people in New England still use. 
Software and SaaS businesses are going to continue to grow mid-single digits, very high margins. They throw off a lot of cash that allow us to make reinvestments in their own businesses or buy bolt-on things for them. And the segment, we think, at the end of the year, will have mid-single-digit organic growth. 
So next, let's look at Medical. I think this will be the last time in a call that we'll be able to contain Medical on one slide. As you can see, we worked very hard to try to achieve that and pretty much made it, but I don't think all that's going on there and everything we know about will allow us to do that ever again. So prepare yourself for 2 slides in 2015. 
So here we are with a very strong fourth quarter, up 12% in revenue. OP was up 15%. Operating margins, 35.5%, aren't the real story here. The real story here is EBITDA. We delivered $126.3 million in the fourth quarter in EBITDA, which was 43.9% EBITDA margin. Really, a way you have to think about this segment now is that it's medical products in one leg, it's software and service in another leg, and then the residual life science imaging component that we have in there. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9%. We had double-digit growth at MHA, with share gains in favorable end markets, which continue. Sunquest growth continued. We had some customer implementation that customers delayed into 2015, that we thought was interesting, which is fine with us. New products at Verathon really drove spectacular growth in the fourth quarter at Verathon, and we like to think that's going to continue throughout 2015. 
Our imaging family improved somewhat with -- Gatan had a strong quarter, which really led that growth. And Gatan has shifted much more emphasis around life science. It used to be kind of split between physical science and life science, but with the new technologies we've introduced and the acceptance of the K2 camera technology and filters, more and more life science is coming our way. 
And in it -- in the last bullet point here, SHP, which is Strategic Healthcare Programs; and IPA, Innovative Products, performed really well. They're certainly on track with what we thought at the time they acquired them and probably have better forward growth than we might have guessed. 
As we think about 2015, I think you have to start with the context of understanding that MHA and Sunquest are really truly transformational for Roper. They're more transformational today than Neptune and TransCore were in the early point of the audies [ph]. They have really great, focused opportunities to build on each one of those businesses, Sunquest and MHA, including acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we can make is much broader than anything we've ever had. 
One disappointment around Neptune is it's done exceedingly well, but we haven't been able to acquire things because its competitors are less than exciting and most of the people we see in this space are not the kind of companies we'd want to own. I think that this Neptune has outperformed all those over these years. 
TransCore, we have been able to build out somewhat through acquisition, but mostly it's been organic growth. But Sunquest and MHA are a different story. 
MHA is capturing new opportunities. It's benefiting from favorable demographics. Its acquisition of Strategic Healthcare Programs was really the first addition that we've had to MHA in the third quarter of 2014. We expect another one's going to happen yet within this quarter. 
Sunquest has had this moderating growth for 2015 because of the meaningful use upgrades that have been driving such high-level growth in the recent past, but our investments in internal development, the things we're doing with partners that we aren't really able to talk about yet, and the opportunities that they have in front of them are really exciting. We're likely to announce another important acquisition here soon that relates to Sunquest. So both MHA and Sunquest, I think you'll see continued acquisitions building those very large platforms down the road. 
The medical device businesses are on a pretty solid growth path for 2015. We think that Verathon's going to continue to have its market share gains and product replacements going on. 
And then we just, last week, announced our first deal of the year. It won't be the last, and that's Strategic Decision Technology, which is a company run by Dan Michelson in Chicago. It's a very exciting company with a new product. It's a small company, kind of low -- just turned past $30 million of revenue. But they've been growing at 20% the last 3 years and now with an infusion of capital from us, they're going to be able to continue to raise that growth specter. And they have a new phenomenal product, which is so important for the country, around cost containment and cost improvement for hospitals. Their StrataJazz platform's been running a number of hospitals in a variety of ways. But the new programs that Dan and his team are going to be offering, that came out of a project that they did for Northwestern hospital's -- University -- is really spectacular. 
In total then, for the segment, we think we'll have mid- to high single-digit organic growth for the segment by the end of the year. And I commit to you that we won't crowd the slide. We'll just do 2 in the future. 
Okay, now 2015 guidance. Here, if we turn the page. So full year guidance, we establish at $6.70 and $6.94, and we put a good deal of energy into looking at this. The organic revenue growth for next year we think will be around 3% to 5%, and that's after completely adjusting for the newer macroeconomic trends that people have seen since December 30 to now. Operating profit leverage, we can probably say will be above 40%, and that's pretty good by anybody's standards. 
Our foreign exchange rate is going to hurt us. We -- all of our guidance is still predicated on the year-end numbers. We think that's going to cost us about $0.10, which is inside these numbers. If the dollar continued to strengthen even more, you'd have a little bit more risk. It could be as high as twice that number. If today's rates lasted for the entire year or it got worse. 
The tax rate, we think will come in around 30% to 31%. That's about a $0.05 headwind into the comparative earnings at the midpoint. So it could be a little higher if the tax rate got higher last year. If you remember, it was 29.9%. So we're hoping it'll be around 30%, but it could certainly go up to 31%. 
The guidance at $6.70 and $6.94 gives you a midpoint of $6.82, is -- excludes any future acquisitions that will occur or any divestures. And the full operating cash flow we're establishing at the beginning of the year, would exceed $900 million of operating cash flow for 2015, with our normally strong cash conversion. 
First quarter, we established DEPS at $1.47 to $1.53. It includes Strata, but it excludes any other acquisitions that will happen in the first quarter or any divestitures that could occur. 
Next slide. So here we look at the 2014 summary and 2015 prospects. So Q4, we had record performance, very strong finish to a terrific year. 
For the full year, we achieved record results in all these categories: orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Revenue was up 9%, with organic up 6%. Very significant financial achievements, sort of threshold level activity, where you see operating profit exceeded $1 billion in the company for the first time. Margin at 28.2, 42% operating profit leverage. The EBITDA exceeded $1.2 billion for the first time and EBITDA margin got all the way up to 33.8%. Free cash flow was 23% of revenue, and we expanded our Medical and software platforms with 3 acquisitions of Strategic Healthcare, Innovative Products and FoodLink. And these 3 deals, which are smaller than the things we've done recently are really a precursor of some of the types of outstanding businesses you're going to see us continuing to add in Medical and software, where they have higher growth characteristics but tend to be somewhat smaller-revenue businesses. And there are a lot of these that we're involved with as we speak. 
In 2015, we expect to have record performance at Roper, despite the fears around macroeconomics. We're going to deploy over $1 billion, we're very confident of, in the year. It could easily be more than that. The first deal, Strata, we talked about a little bit. But it's not going to be the only deal in the first quarter that's likely. 
I think it's important as we close out the call and get ready for the Q&A here that we are really well positioned in 2015. Because the company, really, the emergences of technology platforms and our ability to deploy capital are, frankly, more important than many of the macroeconomic considerations in markets that so many people talk about. So we're looking forward to a great year at '15. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up to Q&A."

How has that evolved, really, since 2008, 2009 where, a, you just see some pretty significant organic growth declines during that time frame? I'm just trying to get a sense for how the portfolio there has evolved and how you expect to just to have a more resilient earnings stream in energy during this downturn that we see."

It doesn't require rig count or anything else. And we didn't have that technology in 2008. That's only just appeared, really, in 2013 and '14. So that's like an additional business that wasn't there previously. We also acquired a software control company called United Controls for CCC, that offers various things that we didn't have out of CCC in terms of dealing with different types of gas turbine engine technologies on a retrofit basis, and that's useful. We had online software that we added to our PAC business: Cambridge Viscosity and Trinity software for CCC. So we've got some things that continue to grow and aren't related to rig counts and upstream activity, so that's good. 
I would say, though, that our businesses that in oil and gas are spectacularly great businesses. They have EBITDA margins that are consistent with the overall enterprise EBITDA margins and pretty much are best-in-class activity. Thank goodness the vast majority of their activity is not upstream. Well over 60% of those businesses are downstream and midstream, and so that helps a lot."

So let's understand that we don't see an enormous decline so, therefore, the large installed base that we have around Compressor Controls and instrumentation for PAC, which really serve the midstream and downstream markets, those will continue because those are more throughput driven. And we don't see the 15% kind of immediate demand shock across not only that segment, but the entire world that we saw in 2009. So we want to make sure that we are very nimble in the way that we act and particularly on the upstream side, where it's always a little more cyclical than the rest of the oil stream market."

And so I'm just trying to get a sense for your confidence in that 40-plus percent incremental. And how are you guys thinking about that across the different parts of your portfolio?"

When we look at Industrial and Energy, that's where we're probably a little more comfortable in the 35% to 45% range, right? A little bit wider variation there because not as much of it is the consistently high margin that we see across the other 2. 
But in terms of confidence going into 2015, we have a lot of confidence around that. I -- we've demonstrated that our ability to have that type of leverage, not only around 2014 but also in previous years.

So it's -- they're not really driven by some aggregate number about demography or a medical market. 
Then if you get to our Sunquest and MHA businesses, which are software and software like, they're -- they have a lot of demography benefits. I mean, there's going to be more testing, not less testing. There's going to be more needs for post-acute care.

We're doing well. Epic's doing well. The space is doing well. 
If you look then at the life science business, that business, Gatan has sort of preemptive technology related to filtering and camera technology for life science, things -- if you're looking at molecular biology, so it's a great space.

I mean, it could happen, but it's not where we're looking. 
So the only good new development in the M&A front is that there's a lot more pressure on the banks to limit their debt-to-EBITDA staples to 6x or 5x. And most of the last several years, debt staples have been 7, 7.5, mezzanine coming on top of it. So private equity can put in 3 or 4 terms of other people's money and use debt at extremely high leverage ratios and be very competitive in the acquisition market. So pretty much, our competitors for -- when we think about who our competitors are and this is a capital deployment company at its core, we look at all the large private equity guys. We love them because they own a lot of stuff we want to acquire. But we're not willing to go up to 4 or 5 or 6x debt to EBITDA, and they start at 6 or 7x debt to EBITDA.

The -- unfortunately, there's never any one answer because we have a roll up here with the revenue we've shared with you in -- 5% is upstream and 9% is midstream and downstream. But while the -- our products and the markets we serve are so niche that they don't lend themselves to the same macroeconomic situation that you see with other people, where you could look at rig counts. 
For instance, what we haven't talked about is how much of our business is upstream oil and how much is upstream gas, how much is in the United States, how much is outside the United States. And we, for competitive reasons, don't want to get more granular than we have, right? So we just feel that the retrofit activity that CCC does and already has booked and continues to do will have growth. 
The upstream portion that they have related in the new LNG projects, is going to be down. And hey, it could be down substantially beyond 20%, but it wouldn't affect us until the second half of the year, because the kind of things that we do on a project basis are still rolling along. 
When -- one of our high-growth small businesses is diesel engine shut-off barrels, which somebody had downstream, but it's really an upstream business. That business last year was up 16%. So we can imagine that it could be up, so we think it's going to be down. The reversal will be more. 
So about the only fair way to answer the question is, what if CapEx and other things fell off and you had a v of 35%, our view would be it would be 35% in the second half of the year, but maybe 15% in the first half of the year. So I think those people who are writing about fears in 2016, they -- we're reading everything everybody's writing. But we got no data to support any downturn yet, except us being conservative and taking a 20% whack off of everything that goes into those markets. 
John, you want to add to that?"

I think that Brian describes what our views are with respect to the guidance and to the expectations for the end market. 
One thing that I would say is that our businesses -- one of the great things about our business structure is we have people who are very close to their customers, right? We have 6 different businesses that have some exposure to oil and gas. And so whether it's Russ, or it's Kevin [ph] or Joe, any of the guys that we know individually, they are very close to their customers and can react very quickly to changes in demand. They're not waiting for us and our assumptions about what's going to happen in the macro world to set their plans. These are very quick businesses to act. The asset-light nature of our business means that they don't have a lot of fixed costs that require a long lead time in order to make adjustments to their cost structure. 
So I have every confidence that these guys are very close to what's happening and will be able to act quickly, whether that means that the market is going to be worse than we currently expect or if it's going to be better than we currently expect.

We just don't have anything like that. We just don't. 
If you look at the physical asset investment that we have and add back accumulated appreciation to that number, our gross investment is very, very small, even in the oil and gas arena.

And with respect to hedging, I mean, you can change the timing, but you can't change the magnitude. Eventually -- unless someone's figured out a way to hedge for the next 20 years and they know what currencies are going to do, you can hedge for a little while.

And then with iTradeNetwork, just if we could, elaborate on what's sort of off the tracks in the U.K. and how FoodLink is opening up the addressable markets there for ITN?"

I mean, there's a lot of things we do, but they have been -- it's not broad based. They're specific situations where you're developing a relationship with the government or developing a relationship with a particular agency. So that's the case in Dubai. Well, people travel in and out of Dubai, marvel at the simplicity of all of the way that traffic moves and how easy it is to buy a tag. It's certainly not lost on any of the other Arab countries, all of whom would like to be deploying these technologies. So the Saudi's now have this breakthrough project in Riyadh. We assume it'll be wildly successful, and that'll encourage them to put in change orders to expand it there. And hopefully over the next 10 years, we'll have a much, much larger degree of penetration around the Arab Peninsula. We're very well positioned in that area to continue to grow. And if you hadn't had the Arab Spring, you would've seen a lot more activity than has been able to occur. 
In Europe, they're pretty well served today, so I don't think we're going to expand much in Europe. And Asia, generally, we have a lot of issues when you get to around quotation. We have few -- a lot very specific boundaries. One is no Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and some of the people who compete in this space don't seem to be bothered by that. But we're very, very conservative in that arena. 
So this Saudi project is a big deal. It's going to be pushing $100 million over the next several years. And we expect it to be $25 million or $30 million this year to offset the Toronto wind down. 
On the subject of iTrade, iTrade's really doing much better now in the U.S. And FoodLink is substantially ahead of the early commitments after just a few months. I think we made a number of improvements to their processes. And they've got good leadership from their own people and our people that are supporting them. 
In the U.K., the pump business has been off quite a bit and the U.K.'s had considerable difficulty with -- it's really not iTrade. It's an acquisition that the KKR people had done just before we bought it, which we would have never done. And it's always been problematic, and it's really more about data analytics. It really ought to be owned by somebody that's in the packaged good analytics arena. But we're going to try to clean it up and make it a little bit better. The end markets haven't been very favorable."

We're uncobblers here. Consolidation rarely sustains growth companies. These businesses, when private equity owns them, they always own them with an eye to exit. So their first year, 18 months of ownership, they're happy to make investments, but they've got to stop on a dime, and they have to capitalize the leverage they get out of those investments, because they've got to get rid of them in 4 or 5 years. So almost invariable, when we acquire them, we're acquiring something that has been underinvested in for growth for a 18-month or 2-year period. And the people can't focus as much on their end market's growth as they can when they come here, because now they can stop worrying about managing for a sale and start worrying about serving their customers and thinking clearly about where to put their resources. That's the reason that we're the successful acquirer of so many of these kinds of businesses. 
I'm sure that Barbara in Strategic Healthcare could've probably, frankly, gotten a larger number from somebody else who would've wiped out everything she built in Santa Barbara and absorbed it, because they would have wanted to cobble it together with something. 
And the same thing would be true in Dan's business in Chicago, with Strata. So Strata's going to be a platform for us, even though it's relatively small now. It's not something that gets cobbled together with Sunquest or with MHA. And we're going to make other acquisitions, some very quickly, that will be very complementary to an MHA and very complementary to Sunquest. So there is a lot of opportunity that we didn't have to find those kinds of things. 
We're always looking for great teams, great ability to grow. Buying a business that's got a little over $30 million in revenue, kind of grow it at 20%, is more interesting than buying a business at $50 million revenue that can't grow at all. So we're excited about that. 
If you noted in Strata, that's an LLC. So the big -- one of the big things about the economics here is we get a really big tax benefit. In fact, our gross tax benefit on Strata's going to be over $40 million. So that's a major part of the consideration in the purchase price of the business. And Strata's a business that's going to have over $30 million of revenue and it's going to have EBITDA in our typical Roper kind of strategies. And the purchase price was $140 million, but that included the $40-plus million of tax benefits."

It's always a balance for us. We think there is incredible value in having a business focused on its niche and on its existing customers, particularly one with -- that has so much runway and ability to capture opportunities like Strata. But we do see the ability to have Strata work with maybe another market opportunity that MHA may have. So we see those as future opportunities, but we never want to have someone take their eye off the ball of the current niche focus that they have. So we're not going to try to combine anything together, but we always think if we smart people in the room together, they'll be able to learn something."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. That press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the SEC. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information.

A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation, which is available on our website. 
For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consist of 2 discrete items. First, the purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue in our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and SHP, which we completed in the third quarter. That totals about $1.4 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. In addition, we had in inventory step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000.

We'll try to get this call finished before your [indiscernible] on. So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year, with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter.",4395,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll try to get this call finished before your [indiscernible] on. 
So if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year, with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We had all-time records for incoming orders, the revenue that we billed, the net earnings EBITDA cash flow. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7%, and we had pretty much broad-based growth everyplace. Operating margins in the quarter reached 30.1%, which was up 110 basis point. And the operating leverage was pretty spectacular in the quarter at 47%. We'll comment about leverage going forward with our guidance. 
Net earnings were up 13% to $187 million, or $1.85; and operating cash flow was up sharply: $1 billion run rate there, at $261 million in the quarter, up 11%, with free cash flow in that same kind of category. There's very little CapEx this year, about 1% of revenue. So a very strong fourth quarter. 
Next slide. When you look at the income statement here, you can the orders were up to $924 million versus $900 million a year ago, up 3%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, but -- so we said before, sort of 0.97 to 1.03 is the normal spread. But in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was always very low -- relatively low because we have so much more year-end invoicing. So really, that book-to-bill of 0.98 is not a problem, and we finished the year at 1.0. 
Revenue was up 7%. We had about 2 points of negative foreign exchange headwinds here in the fourth quarter. 
Gross profit stayed at remarkably high level here, about 60%. The operating margin, as we said before, had 47% leverage. And that was just strong across the board, as you'll see. 
The tax rate was about 60 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, which gave us about $0.015, So you can see the DEPS number of $1.85 versus last year's $1.65. 
Next slide. Cash flow performance in the quarter was spectacular. We had 140% operating cash flow conversion and 136% free cash flow conversion. Our cash flow has been growing. As you can see, if you look at 2012, and then '13 and '14, that's an 11% CAGR on operating cash flow the last 2 years. And our free cash flow was 23% of revenue, which is about same as last year's 23% of revenue. Pretty spectacular number. 
We still think cash is the best measure of performance. And I think if you follow our free cash flow and you follow the continued growth in it, you can get a much better understanding about the quality of the company's businesses. 
Here, we start the full year enterprise results. Next slide. If we look at the full year income statement, orders were above $3.5 billion. They were up 5% and the book-to-bill was exactly 1.0. 
The revenue was up 9% with organic, up 6% for the year, which was certainly in the wheelhouse of what we established as guidance at the beginning of the year. Gross margin for the full year was up 70 basis points to 59.3%, and our operating margin was up 120 basis points. And for the full year, we had operating leverage of 42%. We used to talk about, well, I can go back to 25% to 30%, and then it was 30% to 35%. And recently, it's been 35% to 40%. And we're going to suggest that forward guidance for us is going to have operating leverage at 40% or above on the next dollar of revenue. 
Operating income was up 13%. The earnings before tax were up 16%. Tax was a headwind for us this year as we suggested it would be at the beginning of the year. It was 29.9% versus 29% last year. That caused an $0.08 headwind in our earnings. But even with that $0.08, we still produced $6.42, up 14%. And the GAAP number, of course, was up 19% on earnings per share. 
Next slide. In terms of EBITDA and margin, on the left-hand side, you'll see EBITDA has increased over the last 2 years by 30%, from $925 million in 2012 to $1.2 billion this year. That's a $276 million increase. 
On EBITDA margins, we continued to improve margins, I think, rather spectacularly. 2012, our EBITDA was 30.8% and people were saying, ""Oh boy, you're going to have to revert to the mean now. You'll be back down with everybody else in the 20s."" Well, of course, quite to the contrary, that's just wrong. They were at 32.8% last year and 33.8% this year, and that's all about our governance system and the quality of our businesses, record EBITDA performance. 
Next slide. Here, again, you see a tribute to the governance model, what we have, and the field execution. Our asset-light business model inventory now running 5.1%, receivables at 16.1%. And the way we look at the working capital number, you can see it's dropped from 7% 2 years ago, when people thought that was an unbelievably good number, to now 5% at the end of this year. So our guys continue to understand how to execute our asset-light business model. 
Next slide. We look at the strong financial position and the balance sheet of the company. It's certainly a powerful balance sheet with a lot of powder that we intend to use. You can see that the cash has gone up to $610 million. Now a lot of that's not in the U.S., but our cash and undrawn revolver gives us a $2.1 billion capacity. The trailing 12 months EBITDA now has gone up to $1.2 billion, so our gross debt number at $2.2 billion is 1.8x our EBITDA, and we're going to be quite comfortable if it's at least a turn higher. We'll discuss our activity that's going to be occurring in the first quarter and throughout the year later, but we still believe we're going to deploy about $8 billion over the next 5 years in transactions. 
Next slide. We'll get into the specific detail now on the segment. If we look first at the revenue growth by segment last year, you'll see in the left-hand side on our organic basis, Energy was up 5%; Industrial Technology, half of which is Neptune, was up 7%. Our Radio Frequency was up 5% and Medical was up 8%. If we look at the total revenue growth by segment, you'll see Medical was up 16% as the acquisitions added to the organic number. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the overall segment performance on a dollar value and EBITDA basis so that you can get some better clarity on the fact that RF and Medical represents about 2/3 of our total EBITDA progression. And it's well over half of our revenue now. So the original sort of Energy business is the smallest segment we have at $692 million, still outstanding performance, with $226 million of EBITDA in the larger section. First time, I think, we've ever had $1 billion segment in Roper. So you now have Medical with $1,082 million in revenue, pretty good solid stand-alone entity, with $472 million in EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the oil and gas component of the company, the legacy of the company was oil and gas. And up until through 2007, it was a pretty big portion in the overall company. 
Today, it's a very, very small portion. Our upstream represents 5%. Our Medical, RF and software, water markets are 86% of the company. And the downstream, midstream, which is actually going to have modest growth this year, is about 9%. 
Now what the slide's showing you, in addition to the breakout here, our upstream business is about 5% of revenue. Some of that's in the Energy sector and some is in the Industrial Technology sector, where Roper Pump resides. We have -- even though the market, we think, will be down 20%, perhaps even a little bit more -- or we have a benefit in that Roper Pump has these technologies that we launched and the new facility to get broader categories of those into the marketplace quickly in Houston a year ago, well, those shipments didn't really start to occur until the second half of the year in any level. So we have an easy comp, with the first half of 2015 in those products in which we're gaining share, so that will mitigate what normally would have been a deeper decline in upstream. 
And our field service and retrofit activity in midstream is actually continuing to move up a little bit. And then we have the refinery instrumentation businesses in the field service associated with that also, which will have modest growth. 
One of the things we did in December is we had all of our oil and gas people in for a couple-a-day meeting, where we did a focused review to recast what they had originally submitted for 2015 projections. We had them bridge the risk by customer and by category, by product line. We reviewed the contingency plans and the triggers that they had in place. These guys are world class and nimble execution as they need to do stuff. They've made a few changes already and are monitoring activity routinely. In fact, Friday, we had a dust up on exactly where we were January to date. I'd have to say that the momentum is actually as good as it was in the fourth quarter. We really aren't seeing anything related to product falloff at all. It's above our expectation through the first 3 weeks of January, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But there has not been any early indicator yet, other than project delays and what you hear from other people who aren't really determining their CapEx plans till later. But most of our products are not going into CapEx-driven activity. 
The guidance that we've established and we'll talk about reflects the up-to-date business expectations of all of our oil and gas people as of January 23. And as I say, the product activity hasn't slowed. 
The other thing, I think, as I've read some of the commentary about the company, is people thinking that there's some way to ascertain something that happened in 2008 or 2009 for our company. And I guess we just failed to do a good enough job to remind people who we are. 
If you look at 2008, we added CBORD in February, and then later in the year, we added Horizon and Getloaded and Technolog, 3 software companies. And those weren't in full year for '08. And then if you look at our acquisition since '08, where people are doing comparisons, we've added United Toll, which is a software system that's driving so much of our growth in TransCore; The iTradeNetwork; Verathon; Northern Digital medical; Ascension medical; Managed Health Care Associates; Sunquest; Strategic Healthcare Programs last year; Innovative Product Achievements last year; FoodLink and now Strata Decision Technology. All these are either medical or software companies that created over $1 billion of revenue that's in our numbers today that wasn't there in 2007. So to say there's some quid pro quo on this just belies the reality of who we are and what we've become. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the Energy Systems & Controls sector, we can tell you that there's about $125 million of revenue upstream out of our total Energy Systems & Controls business. You can see in the fourth quarter, their operating profit was up 11%. Their OP margin reached 36.1%, up 280 basis points. And EBITDA for Energy in the fourth quarter was 39%. Organic revenue was up 4%. We had very significant strength, really, in these -- some of the businesses that people think are going backwards, which as far as now, are not. So our diesel engine shut-off safety systems was up in the high teens, and so was vibration monitoring. Field service growth continued. But we did see project activity declining at CCC, or postponement, so that's something that we'll be watching carefully throughout 2015. 
As we look at guidance establishing for next year, we look at upstream declining, which is about 20% of the revenue in this segment. And then we think the midstream and downstream will have very modest growth. And that represents about 40% of the total segment. And then the non-oil and gas businesses are another 40% of the Energy Systems & Controls segment. So when we net it all together with declines in the upstream, modest growth in the non-oil and gas arena, this segment, we think, will come in flat to modest organic growth for the year. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at Industrial Technology. In Industrial Technology, we have about $75 million of upstream revenue in the entire segment. And oil and gas sort of split a little bit between the upstream. Not much downstream in the segment, maybe another $25 million at the most. 
Here, you can see that organic growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, broad based throughout the different businesses in this segment. Our Roper Pump had all-time performance records. They continue to win new customers with the newer technology. And the product investments that we made over the last 2 years have really driven substantial revenue growth and certainly help us as we get the end-market falloff in that activity. 
We had growth at Neptune, driven by strength in the U.S. market. We're starting to see the Toronto project wind down and we'll talk about that here in the guidance. We had double-digit growth in material analysis and the OP margins in our Industrial segment in the fourth quarter, you can see, were 31.4%, up 190 basis points. And EBITDA hit $74.3 million at 33.8% of the revenue. 
So in guiding in 2015, we think Roper Pump share gains will support flat revenue for them in total, despite a pretty steep decline in the market. Neptune, we think will continue to grow in the U.S. The Toronto project completion is expected in the first half of next year. You can never put your finger exactly on that, but they have been moving at a faster pace than they originally suggested. 
We've had continued -- we expect continued growth in material analysis, although you've got some currency issues with the Danish kroner. And then we've got the modest organic growth we're seeing in the segment in whole, only because the Toronto RF project completion should occur sometime in the year. And that could really create about a $25 million to $30 million divot in this segment on revenue, which is the bad news. But the good news is we've got another RF product that's going to offset all of that and then some that we'll talk about as we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment next. 
So next slide. So here we go into RF Technology. We'll just talk about the good news here. We were awarded a substantial contract for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia traffic management system. This will be using our Transsuite software transportation management system. This is totally different than trolling now. This is the stoplight transactions in Midtown Manhattan. There's a lot of installation management in this project, which, of course, is lower-margin work. It's a 5-year contract to support it post-close. We do expect it will completely offset the Toronto wind down of Neptune. Even though both are RF business, one happens to report in Industrial now and one in RF. 
So now we look at the segment as a whole. You can see the revenue was up just slightly. Toll and traffic infinity lane projects execution remain very strong, with favorable variances both in Texas and Florida. We had terrific subscriber growth in our freight matching businesses, DAT and Getloaded. And iTrade strength in the U.S. was pretty good but unfortunately offset by U.K. weakness and problems in the U.K. with that business. Technolog declined, another U.K.-based software business in the utility industry. But bid activity was pretty strong and Technolog tends to be a little bit an up-and-down kind of business and should be up again in 2015. 
So then if we look at the -- in addition to that OP margin at 28.4%, EBITDA for the segment was $82.4 million at 34.3%. And RF now represents 26% of the enterprise's EBITDA. 
In addition to the Saudi contract that was awarded, we do expect additional scope in the foreseeable future around us because Riyadh, of course, a very important city but only one of many. TransCore's backlog and quote activity is going to support segment growth through 2015. And the toll tag growth that we have enjoyed recently is going to continue, particularly in Florida and Texas where people continue to migrate to our very small sticker tag as opposed to the plastic boxes that so many people in New England still use. 
Software and SaaS businesses are going to continue to grow mid-single digits, very high margins. They throw off a lot of cash that allow us to make reinvestments in their own businesses or buy bolt-on things for them. And the segment, we think, at the end of the year, will have mid-single-digit organic growth. 
So next, let's look at Medical. I think this will be the last time in a call that we'll be able to contain Medical on one slide. As you can see, we worked very hard to try to achieve that and pretty much made it, but I don't think all that's going on there and everything we know about will allow us to do that ever again. So prepare yourself for 2 slides in 2015. 
So here we are with a very strong fourth quarter, up 12% in revenue. OP was up 15%. Operating margins, 35.5%, aren't the real story here. The real story here is EBITDA. We delivered $126.3 million in the fourth quarter in EBITDA, which was 43.9% EBITDA margin. Really, a way you have to think about this segment now is that it's medical products in one leg, it's software and service in another leg, and then the residual life science imaging component that we have in there. 
Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9%. We had double-digit growth at MHA, with share gains in favorable end markets, which continue. Sunquest growth continued. We had some customer implementation that customers delayed into 2015, that we thought was interesting, which is fine with us. New products at Verathon really drove spectacular growth in the fourth quarter at Verathon, and we like to think that's going to continue throughout 2015. 
Our imaging family improved somewhat with -- Gatan had a strong quarter, which really led that growth. And Gatan has shifted much more emphasis around life science. It used to be kind of split between physical science and life science, but with the new technologies we've introduced and the acceptance of the K2 camera technology and filters, more and more life science is coming our way. 
And in it -- in the last bullet point here, SHP, which is Strategic Healthcare Programs; and IPA, Innovative Products, performed really well. They're certainly on track with what we thought at the time they acquired them and probably have better forward growth than we might have guessed. 
As we think about 2015, I think you have to start with the context of understanding that MHA and Sunquest are really truly transformational for Roper. They're more transformational today than Neptune and TransCore were in the early point of the audies [ph]. They have really great, focused opportunities to build on each one of those businesses, Sunquest and MHA, including acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we can make is much broader than anything we've ever had. 
One disappointment around Neptune is it's done exceedingly well, but we haven't been able to acquire things because its competitors are less than exciting and most of the people we see in this space are not the kind of companies we'd want to own. I think that this Neptune has outperformed all those over these years. 
TransCore, we have been able to build out somewhat through acquisition, but mostly it's been organic growth. But Sunquest and MHA are a different story. 
MHA is capturing new opportunities. It's benefiting from favorable demographics. Its acquisition of Strategic Healthcare Programs was really the first addition that we've had to MHA in the third quarter of 2014. We expect another one's going to happen yet within this quarter. 
Sunquest has had this moderating growth for 2015 because of the meaningful use upgrades that have been driving such high-level growth in the recent past, but our investments in internal development, the things we're doing with partners that we aren't really able to talk about yet, and the opportunities that they have in front of them are really exciting. We're likely to announce another important acquisition here soon that relates to Sunquest. So both MHA and Sunquest, I think you'll see continued acquisitions building those very large platforms down the road. 
The medical device businesses are on a pretty solid growth path for 2015. We think that Verathon's going to continue to have its market share gains and product replacements going on. 
And then we just, last week, announced our first deal of the year. It won't be the last, and that's Strategic Decision Technology, which is a company run by Dan Michelson in Chicago. It's a very exciting company with a new product. It's a small company, kind of low -- just turned past $30 million of revenue. But they've been growing at 20% the last 3 years and now with an infusion of capital from us, they're going to be able to continue to raise that growth specter. And they have a new phenomenal product, which is so important for the country, around cost containment and cost improvement for hospitals. Their StrataJazz platform's been running a number of hospitals in a variety of ways. But the new programs that Dan and his team are going to be offering, that came out of a project that they did for Northwestern hospital's -- University -- is really spectacular. 
In total then, for the segment, we think we'll have mid- to high single-digit organic growth for the segment by the end of the year. And I commit to you that we won't crowd the slide. We'll just do 2 in the future. 
Okay, now 2015 guidance. Here, if we turn the page. So full year guidance, we establish at $6.70 and $6.94, and we put a good deal of energy into looking at this. The organic revenue growth for next year we think will be around 3% to 5%, and that's after completely adjusting for the newer macroeconomic trends that people have seen since December 30 to now. Operating profit leverage, we can probably say will be above 40%, and that's pretty good by anybody's standards. 
Our foreign exchange rate is going to hurt us. We -- all of our guidance is still predicated on the year-end numbers. We think that's going to cost us about $0.10, which is inside these numbers. If the dollar continued to strengthen even more, you'd have a little bit more risk. It could be as high as twice that number. If today's rates lasted for the entire year or it got worse. 
The tax rate, we think will come in around 30% to 31%. That's about a $0.05 headwind into the comparative earnings at the midpoint. So it could be a little higher if the tax rate got higher last year. If you remember, it was 29.9%. So we're hoping it'll be around 30%, but it could certainly go up to 31%. 
The guidance at $6.70 and $6.94 gives you a midpoint of $6.82, is -- excludes any future acquisitions that will occur or any divestures. And the full operating cash flow we're establishing at the beginning of the year, would exceed $900 million of operating cash flow for 2015, with our normally strong cash conversion. 
First quarter, we established DEPS at $1.47 to $1.53. It includes Strata, but it excludes any other acquisitions that will happen in the first quarter or any divestitures that could occur. 
Next slide. So here we look at the 2014 summary and 2015 prospects. So Q4, we had record performance, very strong finish to a terrific year. 
For the full year, we achieved record results in all these categories: orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Revenue was up 9%, with organic up 6%. Very significant financial achievements, sort of threshold level activity, where you see operating profit exceeded $1 billion in the company for the first time. Margin at 28.2, 42% operating profit leverage. The EBITDA exceeded $1.2 billion for the first time and EBITDA margin got all the way up to 33.8%. Free cash flow was 23% of revenue, and we expanded our Medical and software platforms with 3 acquisitions of Strategic Healthcare, Innovative Products and FoodLink. And these 3 deals, which are smaller than the things we've done recently are really a precursor of some of the types of outstanding businesses you're going to see us continuing to add in Medical and software, where they have higher growth characteristics but tend to be somewhat smaller-revenue businesses. And there are a lot of these that we're involved with as we speak. 
In 2015, we expect to have record performance at Roper, despite the fears around macroeconomics. We're going to deploy over $1 billion, we're very confident of, in the year. It could easily be more than that. The first deal, Strata, we talked about a little bit. But it's not going to be the only deal in the first quarter that's likely. 
I think it's important as we close out the call and get ready for the Q&A here that we are really well positioned in 2015. Because the company, really, the emergences of technology platforms and our ability to deploy capital are, frankly, more important than many of the macroeconomic considerations in markets that so many people talk about. So we're looking forward to a great year at '15. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up to Q&A."

It doesn't require rig count or anything else. And we didn't have that technology in 2008. That's only just appeared, really, in 2013 and '14. So that's like an additional business that wasn't there previously. We also acquired a software control company called United Controls for CCC, that offers various things that we didn't have out of CCC in terms of dealing with different types of gas turbine engine technologies on a retrofit basis, and that's useful. We had online software that we added to our PAC business: Cambridge Viscosity and Trinity software for CCC. So we've got some things that continue to grow and aren't related to rig counts and upstream activity, so that's good. 
I would say, though, that our businesses that in oil and gas are spectacularly great businesses. They have EBITDA margins that are consistent with the overall enterprise EBITDA margins and pretty much are best-in-class activity. Thank goodness the vast majority of their activity is not upstream. Well over 60% of those businesses are downstream and midstream, and so that helps a lot."

And we don't see the 15% kind of immediate demand shock across not only that segment, but the entire world that we saw in 2009. So we want to make sure that we are very nimble in the way that we act and particularly on the upstream side, where it's always a little more cyclical than the rest of the oil stream market."

Then if you get to our Sunquest and MHA businesses, which are software and software like, they're -- they have a lot of demography benefits. I mean, there's going to be more testing, not less testing. There's going to be more needs for post-acute care.

We're doing well. Epic's doing well. The space is doing well. 
If you look then at the life science business, that business, Gatan has sort of preemptive technology related to filtering and camera technology for life science, things -- if you're looking at molecular biology, so it's a great space.

So the only good new development in the M&A front is that there's a lot more pressure on the banks to limit their debt-to-EBITDA staples to 6x or 5x. And most of the last several years, debt staples have been 7, 7.5, mezzanine coming on top of it. So private equity can put in 3 or 4 terms of other people's money and use debt at extremely high leverage ratios and be very competitive in the acquisition market. So pretty much, our competitors for -- when we think about who our competitors are and this is a capital deployment company at its core, we look at all the large private equity guys. We love them because they own a lot of stuff we want to acquire. But we're not willing to go up to 4 or 5 or 6x debt to EBITDA, and they start at 6 or 7x debt to EBITDA.

The -- unfortunately, there's never any one answer because we have a roll up here with the revenue we've shared with you in -- 5% is upstream and 9% is midstream and downstream. But while the -- our products and the markets we serve are so niche that they don't lend themselves to the same macroeconomic situation that you see with other people, where you could look at rig counts. 
For instance, what we haven't talked about is how much of our business is upstream oil and how much is upstream gas, how much is in the United States, how much is outside the United States. And we, for competitive reasons, don't want to get more granular than we have, right? So we just feel that the retrofit activity that CCC does and already has booked and continues to do will have growth. 
The upstream portion that they have related in the new LNG projects, is going to be down. And hey, it could be down substantially beyond 20%, but it wouldn't affect us until the second half of the year, because the kind of things that we do on a project basis are still rolling along. 
When -- one of our high-growth small businesses is diesel engine shut-off barrels, which somebody had downstream, but it's really an upstream business. That business last year was up 16%. So we can imagine that it could be up, so we think it's going to be down. The reversal will be more. 
So about the only fair way to answer the question is, what if CapEx and other things fell off and you had a v of 35%, our view would be it would be 35% in the second half of the year, but maybe 15% in the first half of the year. So I think those people who are writing about fears in 2016, they -- we're reading everything everybody's writing. But we got no data to support any downturn yet, except us being conservative and taking a 20% whack off of everything that goes into those markets.

The asset-light nature of our business means that they don't have a lot of fixed costs that require a long lead time in order to make adjustments to their cost structure.

And then for John, with the FX pressures, we're seeing a number of companies engaging for the first time some additional currency hedging. And would that be appropriate for you guys?"

We have a very good balance between where we generate revenue and where our cost structure lies, so we're not really subject to that risk. The impact that we have is the translation effect of earnings as they're generated, whether they be in Canadian dollars or they're in euros or pounds. 
And with respect to hedging, I mean, you can change the timing, but you can't change the magnitude. Eventually -- unless someone's figured out a way to hedge for the next 20 years and they know what currencies are going to do, you can hedge for a little while. But those are folks that are really more plan driven and have much longer cycles than I think our company does. 
And so as we look at the sensitivity, I think Brian's already mentioned the fact that we are expecting a little bit less than 2% headwind from an FX standpoint for 2015. That translates to about $0.10, so we'll have to see what the future holds."

We've got a great Industrial and Energy business that throws off a massive amount of cash that provides a wonderful annuity for us to go out and maintain an investment-grade status and acquire a lot of great software and medical businesses. And that's what we've been doing for a long time. When there's a confluence of reports that you see out there, I think they fundamentally keep talking about how are you trading as a premium to the multi-industry group? It seems so high when in reality, it's pitifully low against who we actually compete against for market capital. So at some point in time, if that doesn't get recognized better than it does from time to time, there's always flexibility in what we would do. But we're going to keep building out our situation. 
Now we started from next to nothing to create a $1 billion Medical and software company. Our RF business is largely a software company. And Industrial with Neptune -- Neptune's not really Industrial, it's really Radio Frequency. It just reports over there. So I think you're likely to see more internal strategic developments around these various businesses than you are seeing something that would result in a selling off a big component of it or anything like that."

And if you look at $2.2 billion of powder, you got to figure another, what do we say, $900 million of operating cash flow this year. So it would be at $3 billion. It would be nice to get $1.5 billion to work over the next 12 to 15 months to keep our ratios where we are. So at the moment, we're underinvested but that's because of our discipline, not because of the opportunity. And like I said, Strata's not going to be our only acquisition this quarter."

I mean, there's a lot of things we do, but they have been -- it's not broad based. They're specific situations. We're developing a relationship with the government or developing a relationship with a particular agency. So that's the case in Dubai. Well, people travel in and out of Dubai, marvel at the simplicity of all of the way that traffic moves and how easy it is to buy a tag. It's certainly not lost on any of the other Arab countries, all of whom would like to be deploying these technologies. So the Saudi's now have this breakthrough project in Riyadh. We assume it'll be wildly successful, and that'll encourage them to put in change orders to expand it there. And hopefully over the next 10 years, we'll have a much, much larger degree of penetration around the Arab Peninsula. We're very well positioned in that area to continue to grow. And if you hadn't had the Arab Spring, you would've seen a lot more activity than has been able to occur. 
In Europe, they're pretty well served today, so I don't think we're going to expand much in Europe. And Asia, generally, we have a lot of issues when you get to around quotation. We have few -- a lot very specific boundaries. One is no Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and some of the people who compete in this space don't seem to be bothered by that. But we're very, very conservative in that arena. 
So this Saudi project is a big deal. It's going to be pushing $100 million over the next several years. And we expect it to be $25 million or $30 million this year to offset the Toronto wind down. 
On the subject of iTrade, iTrade's really doing much better now in the U.S. And FoodLink is substantially ahead of the early commitments after just a few months. I think we made a number of improvements to their processes. And they've got good leadership from their own people and our people that are supporting them. 
In the U.K., the pump business has been off quite a bit and the U.K.'s had considerable difficulty with -- it's really not iTrade. It's an acquisition that the KKR people had done just before we bought it, which we would have never done. And it's always been problematic, and it's really more about data analytics. It really ought to be owned by somebody that's in the packaged good analytics arena. But we're going to try to clean it up and make it a little bit better. The end markets haven't been very favorable."

And perhaps, private equity hasn't been able to build the scale with these businesses that they might -- you might otherwise think they could.

We're uncobblers here. Consolidation rarely sustains growth companies. These businesses, when private equity owns them, they always own them with an eye to exit. So their first year, 18 months of ownership, they're happy to make investments, but they've got to stop on a dime, and they have to capitalize the leverage they get out of those investments, because they've got to get rid of them in 4 or 5 years. So almost invariable, when we acquire them, we're acquiring something that has been underinvested in for growth for a 18-month or 2-year period. And the people can't focus as much on their end market's growth as they can when they come here, because now they can stop worrying about managing for a sale and start worrying about serving their customers and thinking clearly about where to put their resources. That's the reason that we're the successful acquirer of so many of these kinds of businesses. 
I'm sure that Barbara in Strategic Healthcare could've probably, frankly, gotten a larger number from somebody else who would've wiped out everything she built in Santa Barbara and absorbed it, because they would have wanted to cobble it together with something. 
And the same thing would be true in Dan's business in Chicago, with Strata. So Strata's going to be a platform for us, even though it's relatively small now. It's not something that gets cobbled together with Sunquest or with MHA. And we're going to make other acquisitions, some very quickly, that will be very complementary to an MHA and very complementary to Sunquest. So there is a lot of opportunity that we didn't have to find those kinds of things. 
We're always looking for great teams, great ability to grow. Buying a business that's got a little over $30 million in revenue, kind of grow it at 20%, is more interesting than buying a business at $50 million revenue that can't grow at all. So we're excited about that. 
If you noted in Strata, that's an LLC. So the big -- one of the big things about the economics here is we get a really big tax benefit. In fact, our gross tax benefit on Strata's going to be over $40 million. So that's a major part of the consideration in the purchase price of the business. And Strata's a business that's going to have over $30 million of revenue and it's going to have EBITDA in our typical Roper kind of strategies. And the purchase price was $140 million, but that included the $40-plus million of tax benefits."

It's always a balance for us. We think there is incredible value in having a business focused on its niche and on its existing customers, particularly one with -- that has so much runway and ability to capture opportunities like Strata. But we do see the ability to have Strata work with maybe another market opportunity that MHA may have. So we see those as future opportunities, but we never want to have someone take their eye off the ball of the current niche focus that they have.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast. The link for our webcast is available on our website, www.ropertech.com. 
Please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject news risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information. 
All right. If you'll turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on unadjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix. 
For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consist of a purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions. The total of this is about $1.9 million, which is an add back to both revenue and operating profit. 
As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. This is solely as a result of our acquisition that inspires us to have this revenue adjustment. 
And now if you'll please turn to this next slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

I think the link to these slides are on. If you're having any trouble with normal page, you can go there. 
And the reason for Roper Technologies is sort of obvious, I think for those of us that have been talking with you for the last several years, all you have to really do is look at our gross margins, which this quarter are 60% to recognize that this simply not industrial company. The quality of our businesses, the nature of the amount of money they reinvest to grow themselves and develop technology, the gross margins they have and their long-term growth rates felt like the idea that really is a technology company now and the opportunities that we have are far bigger than they used to be a decade ago when people were focused on product businesses as opposed to software, medical technologies and information networks that could become ubiquitous for niche applications. 
Next slide. If we look at the first quarter, enterprise results, we were able to power through any of the difficulties with oil and gas, upstream stuff that people were talking about, including ourselves going into the quarter. So we achieved record orders revenue net earnings EBITDA and cash flow. Organic revenue was up 5%. We had established guidance at around 3% to 5% throughout the year, Q1 being strong and Q3 being strong, we think, over the course of the year on the organic side. 
Growth clearly was led by Medical and Radio Frequency segments and I'll talk specifically about those shortly. The foreign exchange cost us 3% in the quarter on revenue. 
Our gross margin, as I mentioned, it's 60%, which is our historical breakthrough for us. They were up 140 basis points. 
The operating margin was up 190 basis points, speaking again to leverage and efficiency to 28.7%, and when you think about the amortization, the noncash amortization we have, if you look at our EBITDA results, that's how you can see we did so well in cash, they were 33% in the quarter. 
Net earnings were up 7% to $157 million, DEPS of $1.55. Much more importantly is the cash. We have the same number of shares that generate cash that generate net earnings and our free cash flow was $250 million, up 24% in the quarter compared to the $157 million that we report on a diluted EPS basis. 
We deployed $590 million on 3 great medical separate companies, we'll explain those to you during the course of the morning, so we're really positioned after Q1, which was probably going the weakest quarter we've had for a record 2015. 
Next slide. If we look at the income statement, in Q1, you'll see book-to-bill was 0.98. You may remember we're always talking about 0.97 to 1.03 as kind of the span that's any loss just a normal C because we have so many different issues around when projects bid and what have you, so we're quite comfortable with that. 
Revenue, as we said, was up 5% despite the 3% FX headwind as reported, it's 4%, but on an organic basis, it's 5%. 
If we look at the gross profit, one of the points I'd make in addition to the 60% reflecting our technology platforms, it's really amazing to grow 140 basis points of gross margin in a quarter. If you were 35% gross margin company getting into 36%, people would be raving about it, but it's just amazing when you're at 58.6% that you can get it to 60%. 
Operating income was up 11% to $249 million. We mentioned the margin, up 190 basis points above the gross margin improvement. The earnings before tax were up 11%, but we have real tax headwinds in the first quarter compared to last year. You'll see our tax rate were up 300 basis points and that the headwind cost us $0.07 a share. Even with that, the DEPS were still $1.55 against $1.46 last year. 
Next slide. If we look at our cash flow, it continues to amaze as we compound the cash flow because I suppose if you are using one word to describe the company and a more, it might be that there really a compound there. Our first quarter cash flow of 260 is a 22% increase, and we spent up $10 million in CapEx. So our free cash flow, as we said, is up 24%. The conversion rate on our free cash flow is 161%. 
Now that's beyond spectacular, it represents almost 29% in free cash flow to sales. But in the first quarter, we don't have U.S. tax cash payments, so it tends to be just a little bit overstated in the first quarter. You can see for that reason, we put the trailing 12 months free cash flow of $851 million, which is 24% of revenue and a conversion rate on a trailing 12-month basis of 130% and kind of keeping with our commitment that we expect that always to be above 120% over the course of the year. 
We still believe strongly that cash is the best measure of performance, not some of the things that other people look at. We don't provide cash per share, but we sure think about how much the cash is year-over-year. 
Next slide. The asset-light business model, it's really critical important because when a lot of people talk about business systems, basically our governance process model is our business system. And one of its core components is our focus on working capital. 
Here, you can see, if we just look at the last couple of years, inventory has dropped from the end of the first quarter of 2013 at 6.8% to 5.7%. 
In this quarter, receivables have come in a little bit. Payables and accruals are about the same as they were, so we find that our networking capital number for the end of Q1 is 5%, that's a 270 basis-point improvement in just 2 years time. 
And what I think is incredibly important is if you look at the long history of this continuous journey we've had on getting more asset-light, having much higher velocity, I look back and where we were in the first quarter 10 years ago in 2005 and at that time, our inventory was around 10% versus 5.7% today and receivables were 18.4, the payables and accruals were about 14% versus 18%. 
So when you net those numbers 10 years ago, we were above 14% in networking capital. And here we are now at 5%. And I can assure you that our governance process has a great deal to do with that focus. 
Next slide. If we look at the financial position of the company, you can see that cash has gone up from a year's ago quarter from 500 to 615. Our cash undrawn revolver is still $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA has gone up from $1.118 billion to $1.223 billion. And what is really clear is in the last 9 months, we've deployed $900 million in acquisitions, and yet our gross debt ratio is exactly the same as it was a year ago at $2.1 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.6 so our balance sheet still has a lots of room for us to continue to make acquisitions over the next 12 to 15 months, and there are a lot of exciting things that we're involved with today. So we feel that both the balance sheet and the pipeline are very strong. 
Next slide. Here, we'll  get into the specific segment detail of each of the segments. The next slide is our first quarter 2015 segment performance where you can see how the 4 layout, they all have great gross margins and EBITDA margins. But the power of our RF and Medical Technology businesses becomes much, much clear to people when you look at these slides. 
You'll see, for instance, Medical alone in the quarter generated $135 million of EBITDA. If you added, both Energy at $36 million and Industrial at $63 million together, you get $99 million. So Medical was 136%, more EBITDA than those other 2 businesses combined. 
And if we look at RF and Medical, they represented 69% of the enterprise EBITDA compared to 30% for the Industrial Energy businesses. 
Next slide. The first segment we'll review today is the Energy systems because we go from smallest to largest. 
As you can see in the pie chart, the Energy business in Q1 represented 11% of Roper EBITDA. It had negative organic growth of 5% and FX cost of 5%. 
The oil and gas markets were as weak as we expected. Upstream business, particularly orders were down double digits, and we don't see that really improving throughout the year. I think it will probably deteriorate a little further. 
Our large projects remained particularly slow, which affects our Compressor Controls business and still has decent opportunity in front of it. 
But cost actions were taken at some of these businesses, they're all nimble. But we have a huge advantage because we have a huge asset-light footprint everywhere, so we don't have to deal much about plants, but we've done a few things investing a little less than $1 million in restructuring charges within the quarter, and that's inside the numbers, not an excluded item. 
We had modest organic growth in the refinery application businesses, people seem to feel that's going to continue to improve throughout the year. Our other served markets in energy, which represents about 40% of the segment, coupled those businesses that were instrumentation oriented were up and a couple of the businesses that were sensor products were down. 
For the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year, we would think the oil and gas markets remain challenging with 20% of this business upstream and 40% down to midstream. We wouldn't see that improving during the course of the year, but sequentially, it will get better just because Q1 is always our lowest quarter. 
We think we'll flat the modest growth in the other served markets that we have that work through the energy system networks. The FX headwind should drive mid-single digits segment decline through the balance of the year, in our opinion, but we do think we'll have stronger sequential reporting numbers in the second quarter than we did in the first. And I would point out that the gross margins in Energy in the first quarter were still 55%, so this is not a business that's under siege by any stretch. 
Next slide. Here if we look at Industrial Technology, organic revenue was actually just modestly positive at 1 point of organic revenue. We had FX headwind, which were negative 4 points in here. The share gains at Roper Pump gave us double-digit growth despite the declines in the upstream market, which is exactly what we predicted when we established the guidance. 
Neptune Toronto project is nearing a successful conclusion. It's down year-over-year on a-quarter basis and it will start to be down a little bit more than that in the second, third, and fourth quarters compared to the prior year, so it's a headwind basically for the company. 
We had growth at our Cornell Pump business that was driven by new products and Niche Applications that they have involved with. They may have a little bit of a tougher time with rental companies in the latter part of the year, but it's still holding up well at the moment. 
Our Material Analysis businesses were down slightly, but we had terrific orders. In fact, an all-time record orders for our [indiscernible] business in first quarter, which was a pleasant surprise. 
If we look at that project completion for Toronto, we think should be sometime this summer. We think we'll continue to have weakness in the upstream portion of fluid handling for Roper and Cornell. The Material Analysis business, we think, we'll continue to improve. And given the FX headwinds, we could expect kind of mid-single digits segment decline for the balance of the year after a little bit of positive. And this represents about 20% of the EBITDA for the enterprise. 
Next slide. Here's Roper's RF Technology business. That business had organic revenue growth in the quarter, 11%. It had 1 point of FX headwind, and we actually sold our product line, which is called Black Diamond that was a defense oriented rugged computer technology that really belonged in the hands of somebody that was clearly in that business, and we achieved a sale of that product line in the quarter, which added a little down pressure, and it's been removed from the baseline. 
We had very strong growth in toll and traffic. Our technology, which is trademarked, Infinity Digital Lane Systems continues to be deployed rapidly in Florida and Texas and bidding activity around our infinity blank systems is very robust. 
We had very significant tag shipments that benefited both the revenue and operating margin. You can see the OP profit at $74 million, it was up 19% compared to the first quarter a year ago. 
And we had quite significant subscriber additions to our SaaS-based freight matching model that gave us double-digit growth and normally, that business that grows sort of single-digit so that was very encouraging. 
For the second part of the year, Q2 took through Q4, we think the backlog is going to support the toll and traffic growth. The Riyadh project begins in earnest in the second quarter and our Tag shipments strength that we expect to continue with kind of known places for deployment. 
Our Software and SaaS businesses to grow mid-single digits, but they do gave us very, very outstanding cash returns, so modest growth there. It's always worth a lot of cash. And we think we'll have kind of mid-single digit organic growth for the segment through the balance for the year. 
And you can see RF represents 27% of our EBITDA in the pie. 
Next slide. If you look at Medical Solutions, Medical was up 15% in revenue and 22% operating profit and OP margin was up 230 basis points to 37.3%. It's a lot of noncash amortization in Medical. If I look at the EBITDA margin, it's 44.9%, so truly outstanding businesses. 
Organic revenue was up 7%. We get the 3 points of negative FX in there. Our MHA business had double-digit growth that was really driven by market conditions and new customer additions that we've gotten as they continue to focus on building that platform. 
We had double-digit growth at our Verathon product business. We've got a series of product introductions we talked about last year. All of which are doing well, and we continue to build out their channel to get better coverage. 
Sunquest growth continued despite a difficult comparison. Last year, we had a considerable revenue as a result of implementing meaningful used programs, so one thing to sell the software but implementations, a diverse revenue stream, and that heightened last year's numbers so it will be difficult as a comp throughout this year. But the underlying recurring revenue continues to grow nicely. 
The Scientific Imaging businesses were pretty flat last here. As you'll notice, very the calling out the segment as Medical Solutions because the Scientific Imaging portion really is down pretty much from across the applications, there's not a lot of stuff here to talk about any more. 
We did deploy $590 million of investment in 3 great medical software acquisitions for the Medical Solutions business. We'll explain those in a moment. 
For the balance of the year, we think MHA is going to continue to benefit from favorable market conditions. Most of it appears are getting older and there are there are wide variety of people to provide services and the execution at MHA has is really, really world-class. 
Sunquest, we think is going to continue to perform well against those difficult comps I mentioned above. And Sunquest has a great deal of initiatives around 2016 that are gaining momentum, it certainly did in the first quarter and are continuing now. Some of those we can't really talk a lot about because they're proprietary, but there are very exciting development opportunities for Sunquest. 
The Medical Product growth tend to be led by Verathon and Northern Digital in the last 3 quarters as their pace picks up particularly there. 
We think we'll get mid-teens revenue growth for the segment. And the acquisitions that we made in the quarter really going to help our future growth because there are synergies in the marketplace as they coordinate more with Sunquest and MHA in the future. 
Next slide. If we look at these 3 health care IT acquisitions, these are all software companies. The first, Strata Decision Technology in Chicago has great leader, wonderful team. They're really providing subscription financial analytics and performance platforms for hospitals. These enterprise-wide things are really around the effectiveness and cost-reduction opportunities for hospitals and decision-support so that they can kind of think of themselves a little bit more like the rest of us think about cost and continues improvement and the technology is really spectacular. 
Now they're already in 1 out of  5 U.S. hospitals with one or more of their applications, but they're very early stage for the new applications that have been developed, which is really part of the reason they really needed to be acquired by somebody like us who can rapidly, invest in the development of those. 
SoftWriters as a business that's going to be coordinated with MHA. It's in the long-term care pharmacy space, it provides enterprise software for people who do that work. It has on-premise software delivery models that are yet to recur triggered building, e-prescriptions or something that rapidly is growing and this facilitates that. They had the exact same customer base really as MHA, so the 2 together are going to create a better service footprint for customers. 
In Data Innovations, this is a business that will closely align with Sunquest. It's the largest clinical and blood laboratory middleware provider. And if you think about middleware, you might think about you having to download your printer driver to get your laptop or CPU to print properly well, Data Innovations, for one of the better way to explain it, is really the ability to connect to communicate between lab instruments and the tests that are deployed and then that information showing up where the hospital needs to have it.  The Data Innovations has the largest library with over 1,000 laboratory devices, types of devices connected all over the world. They're deployed in 80 countries, and you can just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tests and feedback that are acquired to the clinical use of the data that they're interacting with. This adds a lot to our Sunquest capabilities in the hospital laboratory markets and both companies should be better as a result of the synergies that we get out of this transaction. 
Next slide would be to update our guidance. When we look at the next slide, we look at the second quarter and the full year guidance, we're raising the guidance from $6.70 to $6.75 to the low end, up to $6.95 at the high-end. Unfortunately, the FX headwinds are much greater. We started the year using the year-end number and that created a $0.10 to drive. That's now up to $0.25 drag as a result of where the currencies are at the end of the first quarter. 
Our tax rate, we still expect to be sort of 30% to 31%, a little higher for the first quarter. Organic growth we think we'll still be in that 3% to 5% thing with the Q1 being strong, Q3 on organic should be strong, second quarter probably not as strong and the fourth quarter, if we get normal at year-end activity, it should be pretty strong again. 
We're going to raise our full year cash flow to $925 million. And we established guidance in the second quarter of $1.59 to $1.64, which we recognize as the FX challenge that we'll have there. 
Next slide. If we look then at the summary before we open it for questions, we had basically record results across the board in a quarter, which is a nice way to start out with Roper Technologies. Organic growth at 5% with Medical and RF driving mostly all. Operating margins at astonishing record at 28.7% and free cash flow, up 24% to $250 million, demonstrating the importance of focusing on how much cash people generate versus sometimes people look at too much on the net earnings number. 
We deployed $590 million on our 3 great acquisitions. The pipeline is terrific, we have a lot of things opened that we're interested in and several things that we're really excited about. 
We do think we'll have a record year in 2015 just powering through the end market challenges we have at some of our businesses. And we were able to raise our DEPS and cash flow guidance even though the FX headwind has increased by another $0.15 a share. 
So with that, would like to open it up for questions for the first time for Roper Technologies."

And that came live in the second half of last year has been building. So we have favorable comp in the first comp in the first half of this year where that continues to go up. Upstream business on the core pump technology was okay in the first quarter, but we expect it to be off throughout the remainder of the year. And in the second half of the year, we'll circle up with the comps from last year. So it will still be better than a year ago, and it helps us at the expense of certain other people that we're making those products. In addition, these drilled things get realigned, so that's like a continuous thing that happens no matter what the level of new drilling is, you get the realigning, and that's a significant business just what we do with Houston. So all that's good, but you still have to moderate that for the fact that the absolute core portion of the upstream product business would decline throughout the year."

For the benefit of us really being a technology provider more so than a broad line supplier to the end market in total.

So as we went through all of our quarterly reviews, that's one of the thing that we did ask about and test. But so far, that's not a concern for us. I think that's also reflected in the fact that gross margin continues to be very strong inside, both the Energy and Industrial segments where it was 55% in Energy and 50% in Industrial. So that's really the proof with respect to price if that's holding well than gross margins certainly bode well."

If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18% and as you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pool the onetime expenses associated with restructuring",286,"Yes, so I'll take the second question first. If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18% and as you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pool the onetime expenses associated with restructuring out of that, you get down into the mid-30% range for the decremental leverage, that's not at all different than what we would expect. We actually think that's very impressive performance out of those businesses given that they start with 55% gross margin. So they are real cost actions, real belt tightening that has to happen, and that will happen and has to say and will continue to happen in order to be able to hold that detrimental leverage in the mid-30% to 40% range. Now as far as going forward, when you think about sequential improvement a little bit throughout the year, like I said, it's really driven by the non-oil and gas portion. So things that are selling into, whether it be plastics or polymers or nondestructive testing, other markets that are not oil and gas related, which is about 40% of the segment, that was down modestly in the first quarter. We expect that to be up modestly as we go forward throughout the year. And then the other piece is the timing associated with some of the project deliveries at CCC, which most of those are for downstream and midstream application, more downstream frankly. And those are things that we expect to come to fruition later in the year. So those are the drivers for why we expect the minus 5% organic in the first quarter to be closer to flat throughout the rest of the year."

I think about -- a lot of your businesses historically kind of in portfolio companies and have not particularly integrated, but it seems like that is now starting to happen with some of these softer deals and it, obviously, makes a lot of sense, it's kind of dizzying to think about how many software systems the hospital might have if you think about all these different things you're starting to put together. I guess, the nature of my question really is, is there a significant opportunity to do that? Do you move to kind of a larger provider of software systems kind of different modalities and things that you're selling out of a bundle? Or do you see these businesses actually remaining fairly separate? Maybe there's a few that overlapped."

If you think about Neptune, we never added anything to it, except that 1.5 is rugged mobile DEPS business that we rolled out never really went anywhere. In TransCore's case, we have made acquisitions that have been very strategic. Several years ago, we acquired this company called United Toll. Well, United Toll has become the entire technology leadership position in the world with toll and traffic with this Infinity Lane system, it's very critical acquisition that we've made and it's kind of fully integrated and gets sold as a bundle. When you think about MHA, I don't think many things necessarily would be sold as a bundle. SoftWriters, it continue to be sold and MHA's products branding would continue to be sold, but they're going to work in an integrated way with one another. In many cases, some of these niche acquisitions will report to to the MHA or Sunquest Platform business. So that's why we suggested that they were transformational in the way that Neptune and TransCore were transformational in '03 and '04. I think we are a little surprised that somebody would've asked us your next $900 million of deployment would be in 1 business or 6, we would have thought it would be 1, but they're so great and so good that we're happy to do those. And I think there will be more smaller acquisitions that are closely correlated. Now that said, there's still are going to be individual niche businesses. We're not going to be the fuller brush man to hospital administrator so a lot of different stuff you pull out of the bag."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast. Available -- the link for our webcast is available on our website, www.ropertech.com.
Please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information.
If you'll turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix.
For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of a purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions. The total of this is about $1.9 million, which is an add-back to both revenue and operating profit.
As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. This is solely as a result of our acquisition that respires us to have this revenue adjustment.
And now if you'll please turn to the next slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

Good morning, everybody. I think you have a slide that says Q1 Enterprise Results, so we'll turn past that and discuss Roper Technologies just for a minute.
We're delighted to be bringing this morning's call to you as Roper Technologies for the first time. We changed the name after the market closed on Friday. The ticker symbol is going to remain the same at ROP. The way the New York Stock Exchange works on name changes is, it takes perhaps 2 days heretofore the trades to go in as Roper Technologies, but you're certainly available to buy the stock today.
You can expect to begin trading on Wednesday, we believe, in the Roper Tech. And John mentioned, it's R-O-P-E-R-T-E-C-H dot com now for the website. That's been changed over the weekend. I think the link to these slides are on it. If you're having any trouble with the normal page, you can go there.
And the reason for Roper Technologies is sort of obvious. I think for those of us that have been talking with you for the last several years, all you have to really do is look at our gross margins, which, this quarter, are 60%, to recognize that this simply is not an industrial company.
The quality of our businesses, the nature of the amount of money they reinvest to grow themselves and develop technology, the gross margins they have and their long-term growth rates reflect the idea that really is a technology company now. And the opportunities that we have are far greater than they used to be a decade ago when people were focused on product businesses as opposed to software and medical technologies and information networks that could become ubiquitous for niche applications.
Next slide. If we look at the first quarter enterprise results, we were able to power through any of the difficulties with oil and gas, upstream stuff that people were talking about, including ourselves going into the quarter. So we achieved record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Organic revenue was up 5%. We had established guidance at around 3% to 5% throughout the year, Q1 being strong and Q3 being strong, we think, over the course of the year on the organic side.
Growth clearly was led by Medical and Radio Frequency segments, and we'll talk specifically about those shortly. Foreign exchange cost us 3% in the quarter on revenue. Our gross margins, as I mentioned, it's 60%, which is a historical breakthrough for us. They were up 140 basis points. The operating margin was up 190 basis points, speaking again to leverage and efficiency, to 28.7%. And when you think about the amortization, the noncash amortization we have, if you looked at our EBITDA results, that's how you can see we do so well on cash. They were 33% in the quarter.
Net earnings were up 7% to $157 million, DEPS at $1.55. Much more importantly is the cash. We have the same number of shares that generate cash as generate net earnings. And our free cash flow was $250 million, up 24% in the quarter compared to the $157 million that we report on a diluted EPS basis.
We deployed $590 million on 3 great medical software companies. We'll explain those to you during the course of the morning. So we're really positioned after Q1, which was probably going to -- we've always thought would have been the weakest quarter we had for a record 2015.
Next slide. If we look at the income statement, in Q1, you'll see book-to-bill was 0.98. You may remember we're always talking about 0.97 to 1.03 as kind of a span that's gaining loss at just normalcy because we have so many different issues around when projects bid and what have you, so we're quite comfortable with that.
Revenue, as we said, was up 5% despite the 3% FX headwinds. As reported, it's 4%, but on an organic basis, it's 5%. If we look at the gross profit, one of the points I'd make, in addition to the 60% reflecting our technology platforms, it's really amazing to grow 140 basis points of gross margin in a quarter. If you were a 35% gross margin company getting into 36%, people would be raving about it. But it's just amazing when you're at 58.6% that you can get it to 60%.
Operating income was up 11% to $249 million. We mentioned the margin, up 190 basis points, above the gross margin improvement. The earnings before tax were up 11%, but we had real tax headwinds in the first quarter compared to last year. You'll see our tax rate was up 300 basis points and that the headwind cost us $0.07 a share. Even with that, the DEPS still were $1.55 against $1.46 last year.
Next slide. If we look at our cash flow, it continues to amaze us. We compound the cash flow because, I suppose if you are using one word to describe the company anymore, it might be that they're really a compounder. Our first quarter cash flow of $260 million is a 22% increase, and we spent around $10 million in CapEx. So our free cash flow, as we said, is up 24%. The conversion rate on our free cash flow is 161%. Now that's beyond spectacular. It represents almost 29% of free cash flow to sales. But in the first quarter, we don't have U.S. tax cash payments, so it tends to be just a little bit overstated in the first quarter.
You can see, for that reason, we put the trailing 12-months free cash flow of $851 million, which is 24% of revenue and a conversion rate on a trailing 12-months basis of 130%, in kind of keeping with our commitment that we expect it always to be above 120% over the course of the year.
We still believe strongly that cash is the best measure of performance, not some of the things that other people look at. We don't provide cash per share, but we sure think about how much the cash is year-over-year.
Next slide. The asset-light business model is really critical and important because a lot of people talk about business systems. Basically, our governance process model is our business system, and one of its core components is our focus on working capital. Here, you can see, if we just look at the last couple of years, inventory has dropped from the end of the first quarter of 2013 at 6.8% to 5.7%. In this quarter, receivables have come in a little bit. Payables and accruals are about the same as they were. So we find that our net working capital number for the end of Q1 is 5%, that's a 270 basis point improvement in just 2 years' time.
And what I think is incredibly important is, if you look at the long history of this continuous journey we've had on getting more asset-light, having much higher velocity, I'd look back at where we were in the first quarter 10 years ago in 2005, and at that time, our inventory was around 10% versus 5.7% today and receivables were 18.4%. The payables and accruals were about 14% versus 18%. So when you net those numbers 10 years ago, we were above 14% in net working capital, and here we are now at 5%. And I can assure you that our governance process has a great deal to do with that focus.
Next slide. If we look at the financial position of the company, you can see that cash has gone up from a year ago's quarter from $500 million to $615 million. Our cash and undrawn revolver is still $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12-months EBITDA has gone up from $1.118 billion to $1.223 billion.
And what is really clear is, in the last 9 months, we've deployed $900 million in acquisitions, and yet, our gross debt ratio is exactly the same as it was a year ago at 2.1 and our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.6. So our balance sheet still has lots of room for us to continue to make acquisitions over the next 12 to 15 months, and there are a lot of exciting things that we're involved with today. So we feel both the balance sheet and the pipeline are very strong.
Next slide. Here, we'll get into the specific segment detail of each of the segments. The next slide is our first quarter 2015 segment performance where you can see how the 4 lay out. They all have great gross margins and EBITDA margins. But the power of our RF and Medical Technology businesses becomes much, much clearer to people when you look at these slides.
You'll see, for instance, Medical alone in the quarter generated $135 million of EBITDA. If you added both Energy at $36 million and Industrial at $63 million together, you get $99 million. So Medical was 136% more EBITDA than those other 2 businesses combined. And if we look at RF and Medical, they represented 69% of the enterprise EBITDA compared to 30% for the Industrial and Energy businesses.
Next slide. The first segment we'll review today is the Energy System because it's -- we'll go with the smallest to largest. 
As you can see in the pie chart, the Energy business in Q1 represented 11% of Roper EBITDA. It had negative organic growth of 5% and FX cost us 5%.
The oil and gas markets were as weak as we expected. Upstream businesses, particularly on orders, were down double digits, and we don't see that really improving throughout the year. I think it will probably deteriorate a little further. Large projects remained particularly slow, which affects our Compressor Controls business and still has decent opportunity in front of it.
But cost actions were taken in some of these businesses. They're all nimble. We have a huge advantage because we just have this asset-light footprint everywhere, so we don't have to do much around plants, but we have done a few things, investing a little less than $1 million in restructuring charges within the quarter. And that's inside the numbers, not an excluded item.
We had modest organic growth in the refinery application businesses. People seem to feel that's going to continue to improve throughout the year. Our other served markets in Energy, which represents about 40% of the segment, a couple of those businesses that were instrumentation-oriented were up and a couple of the businesses that were sensor products were down.
For the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year, we would think the oil and gas markets will remain challenging, with 20% of this business upstream and 40% down to midstream. We wouldn't see that improving during the course of the year, but sequentially, it will get better just because Q1 is always our lowest quarter.
We think we'll have flat to modest growth in the other served markets that we have that report through the Energy Systems segment. The FX headwind should drive mid-single-digit segment decline through the balance of the year, in our opinion. But we do think we'll have stronger sequential reporting numbers in the second quarter than we did in the first. And I would point out that gross margins in Energy in the first quarter were still 55%, so this is not a business that's under siege by any stretch.
Next slide. Here, if we look at Industrial Technology, organic revenue was actually just modestly positive 1 point of organic revenue. We had FX headwinds, which were negative 4 points in here. The share gains at Roper Pump gave us double-digit growth despite the declines in the upstream market, which is exactly what we predicted when we established the guidance.
Neptune's Toronto project is nearing a successful conclusion. It's down year-over-year. On a quarter basis, it will start to be down a little bit more than that in the second, third and fourth quarters compared to the prior year. So it's a headwind, basically, for the company.
We had growth at our Cornell Pump business that was driven by new products and niche applications that they are involved with. They may have a little bit of a tougher time with rental companies in the latter part of the year, but it's still holding up well at the moment.
Our material analysis businesses were down slightly, but we had terrific orders. In fact, all-time record orders for our steerers business in the first quarter, which was a pleasant surprise.
If we look at -- the project completion for Toronto, we think, should be sometime this summer. We think we'll continue to have weakness in the upstream portion of fluid handling for Roper and Cornell. The material analysis business, we think, will continue to improve. And given the FX headwinds, we would expect kind of mid-single-digit segment decline for the balance of the year after a little bit of positive. And this represents about 20% of the EBITDA for the enterprise.
Next slide. Here's Roper's RF Technology business. That business had organic revenue growth in the quarter of 11%. It had 1 point of FX headwind. And we actually sold our product line, which is called Black Diamond. That was a defense-oriented, rugged computer technology that really belonged in the hands of somebody that was clearly in that business. And we achieved a sale of that product line in the quarter, which added a little downward pressure, and it's been removed from the baseline.
We had very strong growth in toll and traffic. Our technology, which is trademarked Infinity Digital Lane Systems, continues to be deployed rapidly in Florida and in Texas. And the bidding activity around our Infinity Lane Systems is very robust.
We had very significant tag shipments that benefited both the revenue and the operating margin. You can see the OP profit at $74 million, was up 19% compared to the first quarter a year ago.
And we had quite significant subscriber additions to our SaaS-based freight matching model that gave us double-digit growth. And normally, that's a business that grows sort of single digits, so that was very encouraging.
For the second part of the year, Q2 through Q4, we think the backlog is going to support the toll and traffic growth. The Riyadh project begins in earnest in the second quarter, and our tag shipment strength that we expect to continue with kind of known places for deployment.
Our Software and SaaS businesses, we think, will grow mid-single digits, but they do give us very, very outstanding cash returns, so modest growth there. It's always worth a lot of cash. And we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment for the balance for the year.  And you can see RF represents 27% of our EBITDA here on the pie.
Next slide. If you look at Medical solutions, Medical was up 15% in revenue and 22% operating profit, and OP margin was up 230 basis points to 37.3%. And there's a lot of noncash amortization in Medical. If I look at the EBITDA margin, it's 44.9%, so truly outstanding businesses. Organic revenue was up 7%. We get the 3 points of negative FX in there.
Our MHA business had double-digit growth that was really driven by market conditions and new customer additions that we've gotten, as they continue to focus on building that platform. We had double-digit growth at our Verathon product business. We've got a series of product introductions we talked about last year, all of which are doing well. And we continue to build out their channel to get better coverage.
Sunquest growth continued despite a difficult comparison. Last year, we had a considerable revenue as a result of implementing meaningful use programs. So one thing is to sell the software, but implementation is a different -- a diverse revenue stream, and that heightened last year's numbers, so it will be difficult as a comp throughout this year. But the underlying recurring revenue continues to grow nicely.
The Scientific Imaging businesses were pretty flat here. As you'll notice, we're virtually calling out the segment as Medical Solutions because the Scientific Imaging portion really is down pretty much to microscopy applications. There's not a lot of stuff here to talk about anymore.
We did deploy $590 million of investment in 3 great medical software acquisitions for the Medical solutions business. We'll explain those in a moment. For the balance of the year, we think MHA is going to continue to benefit from favorable market conditions. Most of us appear to be getting older, and there are a wide variety of people to provide services to. And the execution that MHA has is really, really world-class.
Sunquest, we think, is going to continue to perform well against those difficult comps I mentioned above. And Sunquest has a great deal of initiatives around 2016 that are gaining momentum, certainly did in the first quarter and are continuing now. Some of those we can't really talk a lot about because they're proprietary, but they're very exciting development opportunities for Sunquest.
The Medical products growth, we think, will be led by Verathon and Northern Digital in the last 3 quarters, as their pace picks up particularly there. We think we'll get mid-teens revenue growth for the segment. And the acquisitions that we made in the quarter are really going to help our future growth because there are synergies in the marketplace as they coordinate more with Sunquest and MHA in the future.
Next slide. If we look at these 3 health care IT acquisitions, these are all software companies. The first, Strata Decision Technology is in Chicago, has a great leader, wonderful team. They're really providing subscription financial analytics and performance platforms for hospitals. These enterprise-wide things are really around the effectiveness and cost-reduction opportunities for hospitals and decision support so that they can kind of think of themselves a little bit more like the rest of us think about cost and continuous improvement, and the technology is really spectacular.
Now they're already in 1 out of  5 U.S. hospitals with one or more of their applications, but they're very early stage for the new applications that have been developed, which is really part of the reason we -- they really needed to be acquired by somebody like us who can rapidly invest in the development of those.
SoftWriters is a business that's going to be coordinated with MHA. It's in the long-term care pharmacy space. It provides enterprise software for people who do that work. It has on-premise software delivery models that get recurred billing, e-prescriptions or something that rapidly is growing, and this facilitates that. They had the exact same customer base really as MHA, so the 2, together, are going to create a better service footprint for customers.
In Data Innovations, this is a business that will closely align with Sunquest. It's the largest clinical and blood laboratory middleware provider. And if you think about middleware, you might think about you having to download your printer driver to get your laptop or CPU to print properly well. Data Innovations, for one of a better way to explain it, is really the ability to connect, to communicate between lab instruments and the tests that are better deployed, and then that information showing up where the hospital needs to have it. The Data Innovations has the largest library, with over 1,000 laboratory devices, types of devices connected all over the world. They're deployed in 80 countries. And you can just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tests and feedback that are required to the clinical use of the data that they're interacting with. This adds a lot to our Sunquest capabilities in the hospital laboratory markets, and both companies should be better as a result of the synergies that we get out of this transaction.
Next slide would be to update our guidance. When we look at the -- next slide. If we look at the second quarter and the full year guidance, we're raising the guidance from $6.70 to $6.75 on the low end, up to $6.95 at the high end. Unfortunately, the FX headwinds are much greater. We started the year with using the year-end number, and that created a $0.10 drag. That's now up to a $0.25 drag as a result of where the currencies are at the end of the first quarter.
Our tax rate, we still expect to be sort of 30% to 31%, a little higher than it was in the first quarter. Organic growth, we think, will still be in the 3% to 5% thing, with Q1 being strong; Q3, on organic, should be strong; second quarter, probably not as strong; and the fourth quarter, if we get normal year-end activity, should be pretty strong again.
We're going to raise our full year cash flow to $925 million. And we established guidance in the second quarter of $1.59 to $1.64, which we recognize as the FX challenge that we'll have there.
Next slide. If we look then at the summary, before we open it for questions, we had basically record results across the board in the quarter, which is a nice way to start out with Roper Technologies. Organic growth at 5%, with Medical and RF driving mostly all of it. Operating margins at astonishing records at 28.7%; and free cash flow, up 24% to $250 million, demonstrating the importance of focusing on how much cash people generate versus sometimes people looking too much on the net earnings number.
We deployed $590 million on our 3 great acquisitions. The pipeline is terrific. We have a lot of things open that we're interested in and several things that we're really excited about. We do think we'll have a record year in 2015, just powering through the end-market challenges we have in some of our businesses. And we were able to raise our DEPS and cash flow guidance, even though the FX headwind was an increase by another $0.15 a share.
So with that, we'd like to open it up for questions for the first time for Roper Technologies."

And that came live in the second half of last year and has been building. So we have a favorable comp in the first half of this year, where that continues to go up. The upstream business on the core pump technology was okay in the first quarter, but we expect it to be off throughout the remainder of the year. And in the second half of the year, we'll circle up with the comps from last year. So it will still be better than a year ago, and it helps us at the expense of certain other people that we're making those products. In addition, these drill things get relined, so that's like a continuous thing that happens no matter what the level of new drilling is, you get the relining, and that's a significant business. So it's just what we do in Houston. So all that's good, but you still have to moderate that with the fact that the absolute core portion of the upstream product business will decline throughout the year."

So as we went through all of our quarterly reviews, that's one of the things that we did ask about and test. But so far, that's not a concern for us. I think that's also reflected in the fact that gross margin continues to be very strong inside both the Energy and Industrial segments, where it was 55% in Energy and 50% in Industrial. So that's really the proof with respect to price. If that's holding well, then gross margins generally will hold well."

If you have more project work, it adds pressure on the margin. But if you have more hardware, tag and technology shipments, then you have margin upside, and that's what we saw this quarter.

If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18%. And if you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pull the one-time expenses associated with restructuring out of that, you get down into the mid-30% range for the decremental leverage. That's not at all different than what we would expect. We actually think that's very impressive performance out of those businesses, given that they start with 55% gross margin. So there's real cost actions, real belt tightening that has to happen and it will happen, and as we say, it will continue to happen in order to be able to hold that decremental leverage in the mid-30% to 40% range. Now as far as going forward, when you think about sequential improvement a little bit throughout the year, like I said, it's really driven by the non-oil and gas portion. So things that are selling into, whether it be plastics or polymers or nondestructive testing, other markets that are not oil and gas-related, which is about 40% of the segment, that was down modestly in the first quarter. We expect that to be up modestly as we go forward throughout the year. And then the other piece is the timing associated with some of the project deliveries at CTC, which most of those are for downstream and midstream applications, more downstream, frankly. And those are things that we expect to come to fruition later in the year. So those are the drivers for why we expect the minus 5% organic in the first quarter to be closer to flat throughout the rest of the year."

If you think about Neptune, we never added anything to it, except they wanted to have this rugged mobile DAT business that we rolled over on and it never really went anywhere. In TransCore's case, we have made acquisitions that have been very strategic. Several years ago, we acquired this company called United Toll. Well, United Toll has become the entire technology leadership position around the world on toll and traffic with this Infinity Lane Systems, very critical acquisition we made. And it's kind of fully integrated and gets sold as a bundle. When you think about MHA, I don't think many things necessarily would be sold as a bundle. SoftWriters, they continue to be sold. And MHA's product branding would continue to be sold, but they're going to work in an integrated way with one another. And in many cases, some of these niche acquisitions will report to the MHA or Sunquest platform business. So that's why we suggested that they were transformational in the way that Neptune and TransCore were transformational in '03 and '04. I think we are a little surprised if somebody would've asked us your next $900 million of deployment would be in 1 business or 6, we would have thought it would be 1, but they're so great and so good that we're happy to do those. And I think there will be more smaller acquisitions that are closely correlated. Now that said, they're still all going to be individual niche businesses.

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast. Available -- the link for our webcast is available on our website, www.ropertech.com.
Please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information.
If you'll turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix.
For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of a purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions. The total of this is about $1.9 million, which is an add-back to both revenue and to operating profit.
As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. This is solely as a result of our acquisition that requires us to have this revenue adjustment.
And now if you'll please turn to the next slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

I think you have a slide that says Q1 Enterprise Results, so we'll turn past that and discuss Roper Technologies just for a minute.We're delighted to be bringing this morning's call to you as Roper Technologies for",3712,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I think you have a slide that says Q1 Enterprise Results, so we'll turn past that and discuss Roper Technologies just for a minute.
We're delighted to be bringing this morning's call to you as Roper Technologies for the first time. We changed the name after the market closed on Friday. The ticker symbol is going to remain the same at ROP. The way the New York Stock Exchange works on name changes is it takes perhaps 2 days here for the trades to go in as Roper Technologies, but you're certainly available to buy the stock today.
You can expect to begin trading on Wednesday, we believe, in the Roper Tech. And John mentioned, it's R-O-P-E-R-T-E-C-H dot com now for the website. That's been changed over the weekend. I think the link to these slides are on it. If you're having any trouble with normal feeds, you can go there.
And the reason for Roper Technologies is sort of obvious. I think for those of us that have been talking with you for the last several years, all you have to really do is look at our gross margins, which, this quarter, are 60%, to recognize that this simply is not an industrial company.
The quality of our businesses, the nature of the amount of money they reinvest to grow themselves and develop technology, the gross margins they have and their long-term growth rates reflect the idea that it really is a technology company now. And the opportunities that we have are far greater than they used to be a decade ago, when people were focused on product businesses as opposed to software and medical technologies and information networks that could become ubiquitous for niche applications.
Next slide. If we look at the first quarter enterprise results, we were able to power through any of the difficulties with oil and gas upstream stuff that people were talking about, including ourselves, going into the quarter. So we achieved record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Organic revenue was up 5%. We had established guidance at around 3% to 5% throughout the year, Q1 being strong and Q3 being strong, we think, over the course of the year on the organic side.
Growth clearly was led by Medical and Radio Frequency segments, and we'll talk specifically about those shortly. The foreign exchange cost us 3% in the quarter on revenue. Our gross margins, as I mentioned, it's 60%, which is a historical breakthrough for us. They were up 140 basis points. The operating margin was up 190 basis points, speaking again to leverage and efficiency, to 28.7%. And when you think about the amortization, the noncash amortization we have, if you looked at our EBITDA results, that's how you can see we do so well on cash. They were 33% in the quarter.
Net earnings were up 7% to $157 million, DEPS at $1.55. Much more importantly is the cash. We have the same number of shares that generate cash as generate net earnings. And our free cash flow was $250 million, up 24% in the quarter compared to the $157 million that we report on a diluted EPS basis.
We deployed $590 million on 3 great medical software companies. We'll explain those to you during the course of the morning. So we're really positioned, after Q1, which was probably going to -- we always thought it would have been the weakest quarter we had, for a record 2015.
Next slide. If we look at the income statement, in Q1, you'll see book-to-bill was 0.98. You may remember we're always talking about 0.97 to 1.03 as kind of a span. That's meaningless, it's just normalcy because we have so many different issues around when projects bid and what have you, so we're quite comfortable with that.
Revenue, as we said, was up 5% despite the 3% FX headwinds. As reported, it's 4%, but on an organic basis, it's 5%. If we look at the gross profit, one of the points I'd make, in addition to the 60% reflecting our technology platforms, it's really amazing to grow 140 basis points of gross margin in a quarter. If you were a 35% gross margin company getting it to 36%, people would be raving about it. But it's just amazing when you're at 58.6% that you can get it to 60%.
Operating income was up 11% to $249 million. We mentioned the margin, up 190 basis points, above the gross margin improvement. The earnings before tax were up 11%, but we had real tax headwinds in the first quarter compared to last year. You'll see our tax rate was up 300 basis points and that the headwind cost us $0.07 a share. Even with that, the DEPS still were $1.55 against $1.46 last year.
Next slide. If we look at our cash flow, it continues to amaze us. We compound the cash flow because, I suppose if you are using one word to describe the company anymore, it might be that they're really a compounder. Our first quarter cash flow of $260 million is a 22% increase, and we spent around $10 million in CapEx. So our free cash flow, as we said, is up 24%. The conversion rate on our free cash flow is 161%. Now that's beyond spectacular. It represents almost 29% of free cash flow to sales. But in the first quarter, we don't have U.S. tax cash payments, so it tends to be just a little bit overstated in the first quarter.
You can see, for that reason, we put the trailing 12-months free cash flow of $851 million, which is 24% of revenue and a conversion rate on a trailing 12-months basis of 130%, in, kind of keeping with our commitment that we expect it always to be above 120% over the course of the year.
We still believe strongly that cash is the best measure of performance, not some of the things that other people look at. We don't provide cash per share, but we sure think about how much the cash is year-over-year.
Next slide. The asset-light business model -- it's really critical and important, because while a lot of people talk about business systems, basically, our governance process model is our business system, and one of its core components is our focus on working capital. Here, you can see, if we just look at the last couple of years, inventory has dropped from the end of the first quarter of 2013 at 6.8% to 5.7%. In this quarter, receivables have come in a little bit. Payables and accruals are about the same as they were. So we find that our net working capital number for the end of Q1 is 5%. That's a 270 basis point improvement in just 2 years' time.
And what I think is incredibly important is, if you look at the long history of this continuous journey we've had on getting more asset-light, having much higher velocity, I looked back at where we were in the first quarter 10 years ago, in 2005, and at that time, our inventory was around 10% versus 5.7% today and receivables were 18.4%. The payables and accruals were about 14% versus 18%. So when you net those numbers, 10 years ago, we were above 14% in net working capital, and here we are now at 5%. And I can assure you that our governance process has a great deal to do with that focus.
Next slide. If we look at the financial position of the company, you can see that cash has gone up from a year ago's quarter from $500 million to $615 million. Our cash and undrawn revolver is still $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12-months EBITDA has gone up from $1.118 billion to $1.223 billion.
And what is really clear is, in the last 9 months, we've deployed $900 million in acquisitions, and yet, our gross debt ratio is exactly the same as it was a year ago at 2.1 and our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.6. So our balance sheet still has lots of room for us to continue to make acquisitions over the next 12 to 15 months, and there are a lot of exciting things that we're involved with today. So we feel the -- both the balance sheet and the pipeline are very strong.
Next slide. Here, we'll get into the specific segment detail of each of the segments. The next slide is our first quarter 2015 segment performance where you can see how the 4 lay out. They all have great gross margins and EBITDA margins. But the power of our RF and Medical Technology businesses becomes much, much clearer to people when you look at these slides.
You'll see, for instance, Medical alone in the quarter generated $135 million of EBITDA. If you added both Energy at $36 million and Industrial at $63 million together, you get $99 million. So Medical was 136% more EBITDA than those other 2 businesses combined. And if we look at RF and Medical, they represented 69% of the enterprise EBITDA compared to 30% for the Industrial and Energy businesses.
Next slide. The first segment we'll review today is the Energy System because it's -- we'll go with the smallest to largest. 
As you can see in the pie chart, the Energy business in Q1 represented 11% of Roper EBITDA. It had negative organic growth of 5% and FX cost us 5%.
The oil and gas markets were as weak as we expected. Upstream businesses, particularly on orders, were down double digits, and we don't see that really improving throughout the year. I think it will probably deteriorate a little further. Large projects remained particularly slow, which affects our Compressor Controls business and it still has decent opportunity in front of it.
But cost actions were taken in some of these businesses. They're all nimble. We have a huge advantage because we just have this asset-light footprint everywhere, so we don't have to do much around plants, but we have done a few things, investing a little less than $1 million in restructuring charges within the quarter. And that's inside the numbers, not an excluded item.
We had modest organic growth in the refinery application businesses. People seem to feel that's going to continue to improve throughout the year. Our other served markets in Energy, which represents about 40% of the segment, a couple of those businesses that were instrumentation-oriented were up and a couple of the businesses that were sensor products were down.
For the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year, we would think the oil and gas markets will remain challenging, with 20% of this business upstream and 40% in down to midstream. We wouldn't see that improving during the course of the year, but sequentially, it will get better just because Q1 is always our lowest quarter.
We think we'll have flat to modest growth in the other served markets that we have that report through the Energy Systems segment. The FX headwind should drive mid-single-digit segment decline through the balance of the year, in our opinion. But we do think we'll have stronger sequential reporting numbers in the second quarter than we did in the first. And I would point out that gross margins in Energy in the first quarter were still 55%, so this is not a business that's under siege by any stretch.
Next slide. Here, if we look at Industrial Technology, organic revenue was actually just modestly positive, 1 point of organic revenue. We had FX headwinds, which were negative 4 points in here. The share gains at Roper Pump gave us double-digit growth despite the declines in the upstream market, which is exactly what we predicted when we established the guidance.
Neptune's Toronto project is nearing a successful conclusion. It's down year-over-year. On a quarter basis, it will start to be down a little bit more than that in the second, third and fourth quarters compared to the prior year. So it's a headwind, basically, for the company.
We had growth at our Cornell Pump business that was driven by new products and niche applications that they are involved with. They may have a little bit of a tougher time with rental companies in the latter part of the year, but it's still holding up well at the moment.
Our material analysis businesses were down slightly, but we had terrific orders. In fact, all-time record orders for our Struers business in the first quarter, which was a pleasant surprise.
If we look at -- that project completion for Toronto we think should be sometime this summer. We think we'll continue to have weakness in the upstream portion of fluid handling for Roper and Cornell. The material analysis business we think will continue to improve. And given the FX headwinds, we would expect kind of mid-single-digit segment decline for the balance of the year after a little bit of positive. And this represents about 20% of the EBITDA for the enterprise.
Next slide. Here's Roper's RF Technology business. That business had organic revenue growth in the quarter of 11%. It had 1 point of FX headwind. And we actually sold a product line, which is called Black Diamond, that was a defense-oriented, rugged computer technology that really belonged in the hands of somebody that was clearly in that business. And we achieved a sale of that product line in the quarter, which added a little downward pressure, and it's been removed from the baseline.
We had very strong growth in toll and traffic. Our technology, which is trademarked Infinity Digital Lane Systems, continues to be deployed rapidly in Florida and in Texas. And bidding activity around our Infinity Lane Systems is very robust.
We had very significant tag shipments that benefited both the revenue and the operating margin. You can see the OP profit, at $74 million, was up 19% compared to the first quarter of a year ago.
And we had quite significant subscriber additions to our SaaS-based freight matching model that gave us double-digits growth. And normally, that's a business that grows sort of single digits, so that was very encouraging.
For the second part of the year, Q2 through Q4, we think the backlog is going to support the toll and traffic growth. The Riyadh project begins in earnest in the second quarter, and our tag shipment strength that we expect to continue with kind of known places for deployment.
Our Software and SaaS businesses we think will grow mid-single digits, but they do give us very, very outstanding cash returns, so modest growth there. It's always worth a lot of cash. And we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment for the balance for the year.  And you can see RF represents 27% of our EBITDA here on the pie.
Next slide. If you look at Medical solutions, Medical was up 15% in revenue and 22% operating profit, and OP margin was up 230 basis points to 37.3%. And there's a lot of noncash amortization in Medical. If I look at the EBITDA margin, it's 44.9%, so truly outstanding businesses. Organic revenue was up 7%. We've got the 3 points of negative FX in there.
Our MHA business had double-digit growth that was really driven by market conditions and new customer additions that we've gotten, as they continue to focus on building that platform. We had double-digit growth at our Verathon product business. We've got a series of product introductions we talked about last year, all of which are doing well. And we continue to build out their channel to get better coverage.
Sunquest's growth continued despite a difficult comparison. Last year, we had considerable revenue as a result of implementing meaningful use programs. So one thing is to sell the software, but implementation is a different -- a diverse revenue stream, and that heightened last year's numbers, so it will be difficult as a comp throughout this year. But the underlying recurring revenue continues to grow nicely.
The Scientific Imaging businesses were pretty flat here. As you'll notice, we're really calling out the segment as Medical Solutions because the Scientific Imaging portion really is down pretty much to microscopy applications. There's not a lot of stuff here to talk about anymore.
We did deploy $590 million of investment in 3 great medical software acquisitions for the Medical Solutions business. We'll explain those in a moment. For the balance of the year, we think MHA is going to continue to benefit from favorable market conditions. Most of us appear to be getting older, and there are a wide variety of people to provide services to. And the execution that MHA has is really, really world-class.
Sunquest we think is going to continue to perform well against those difficult comps I mentioned above. And Sunquest has a great deal of initiatives around 2016 that are gaining momentum, certainly did in the first quarter and are continuing now. Some of those we can't really talk a lot about because they're proprietary, but they're very exciting development opportunities for Sunquest.
The Medical products growth we think will be led by Verathon and Northern Digital in the last 3 quarters, as their pace picks up particularly there. We think we'll get mid-teens revenue growth for the segment. And the acquisitions that we made in the quarter are really going to help our future growth because there are synergies in the marketplace as they coordinate more with Sunquest and MHA in the future.
Next slide. If we look at these 3 health care IT acquisitions, these are all software companies. The first, Strata Decision Technology, is in Chicago, has a great leader, a wonderful team. They're really providing subscription financial analytics and performance platforms for hospitals. These enterprise-wide things are really around the effectiveness in cost-reduction opportunities for hospitals and decision support so that they can kind of think of themselves a little bit more like the rest of us think about cost and continuous improvement, and the technology is really spectacular.
Now they're already in 1 out of  5 U.S. hospitals with one or more of their applications, but they're very early stage for the new applications that have been developed, which is part of the reason we -- they really needed to be acquired by somebody like us who can rapidly invest in the development of those.
SoftWriters is a business that's going to be coordinated with MHA. It's in the long-term care pharmacy space. It provides enterprise software for people who do that work. It has on-premise software delivery models that get recurred billing. E-prescriptions are something that rapidly is growing, and this facilitates that. They have the exact same customer base really as MHA, so the 2 together are going to create a better service footprint for customers.
In Data Innovations, this is a business that will closely align with Sunquest. It's the largest clinical and blood laboratory middleware provider. And if you think about middleware, you might think about you having to download your printer driver to get your laptop or CPU to print properly. Well, Data Innovations, for want of a better way to explain it, is really the ability to connect, to communicate between lab instruments and the tests that are deployed, and then that information showing up where the hospital needs to have it. The -- Data Innovations has the largest library, with over 1,000 laboratory devices, types of devices, connected all over the world. They're deployed in 80 countries. And you can just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tests and feedback that are required to the clinical use of the data that they're interacting with. This adds a lot to our Sunquest capabilities in the hospital laboratory markets, and both companies should be better as a result of the synergies that we get out of this transaction.
Next slide would be to update our guidance. When we look at the -- I'm sorry, the next slide. If we look at the second quarter and the full year guidance, we're raising the guidance from $6.70 to $6.75 on the low end, up to $6.95 at the high end. Unfortunately, the FX headwinds are much greater. We started the year with using the year-end number, and that created a $0.10 drag. That's now up to a $0.25 drag as a result of where the currencies are at the end of the first quarter.
Our tax rate we still expect to be sort of 30% to 31%, a little higher than it was in the first quarter. Organic growth we think will still be in the 3% to 5% thing, with Q1 being strong; Q3, on organic, should be strong; second quarter, probably not as strong; and the fourth quarter, if we get normal year-end activity, should be pretty strong again.
We're going to raise our full year cash flow to $925 million. And we established guidance in the second quarter of $1.59 to $1.64, which recognizes the FX challenge that we'll have there.
Next slide. If we look then at the summary, before we open it for questions, we had basically record results across the board in the quarter, which is a nice way to start out with Roper Technologies. Organic growth at 5%, with Medical and RF driving mostly all of it. Operating margins at astonishing records at 28.7% and free cash flow, up 24% to $250 million, demonstrating the importance of focusing on how much cash people generate versus sometimes people looking too much on the net earnings number.
We deployed $590 million on our 3 great acquisitions. The pipeline is terrific. We have a lot of things open that we're interested in and several things that we're really excited about. We do think we'll have a record year in 2015, just powering through the end-market challenges we have in some of our businesses. And we were able to raise our DEPS and cash flow guidance, even though the FX headwinds increased by another $0.15 a share.
So with that, we'd like to open it up for questions for the first time for Roper Technologies."

And that came live in the second half of last year and has been building. So we have a favorable comp in the first half of this year, where that continues to go up. The upstream business on core pump technology was okay in the first quarter, but we expect it to be off throughout the remainder of the year. And in the second half of the year, we'll circle up with the comps from last year. So it will still be better than a year ago, and it helps us, at the expense of certain other people, but we're making those products. In addition, these drill things get relined, so that's like a continuous thing that happens no matter what the level of new drilling is, you get the relining, and that's a significant business. So it's just what we do in Houston. So all that's good, but you still have to moderate that with the fact that the absolute core portion of the upstream pump business will decline throughout the year."

So we have very niche applications where, in many cases, we're the only person who can really provide the solution that's being required. So as we went through all of our quarterly reviews, that's one of the things that we did ask about and test. But so far, that's not a concern for us. I think that's also reflected in the fact that the gross margin continues to be very strong inside both the Energy and Industrial segments, where it was 55% in Energy and 50% in Industrial. So that's really the proof with respect to price. If that's holding well, then gross margins generally will hold well."

If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18%, and if you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pull the one-time expenses associated with restructuring out of that, and you get down into the mid-30% range for the decremental leverage. That's not at all different than what we would expect. We actually think that's very impressive performance out of those businesses, given that they start with 55% gross margin. So there's real cost actions, real belt tightening that has to happen and that will happen, and as  -- and will continue to happen in order to be able to hold that decremental leverage in the mid-30% to 40% range. Now as far as going forward, when you think about sequential improvement a little bit throughout the year, like I said, it's really driven by the non-oil and gas portion. So our things that are selling into, whether it be plastics or polymers or nondestructive testing, other markets that are not oil and gas-related, which is about 40% of the segment, that was down modestly in the first quarter. We expect that to be up modestly as we go forward throughout the year. And then the other piece is the timing associated with some of the project deliveries at CCC, which most of those are for downstream and midstream applications, more downstream, frankly. And those are things that we expect to come to fruition later in the year. So those are the drivers for why we expect the minus 5% organic in the first quarter to be closer to flat throughout the rest of the year."

If I think about -- a lot of your businesses, historically, they've kind of been portfolio companies and have not particularly integrated.

It's kind of dizzying to think about how many software systems a hospital might have if you think about all this different things you're starting to put together. I guess the nature of my question really is, is there a significant opportunity to do that?

If you think about Neptune, we never added anything to it, except they wanted to have this rugged mobile DAT business that we rolled over on and it never really went anywhere. In TransCore's case, we have made acquisitions that have been very strategic. Several years ago, we acquired this company called United Toll. Well, United Toll has become the entire technology leadership position around the world on toll and traffic with this Infinity Lane Systems. A very critical acquisition we made. And it's kind of fully integrated and gets sold as a bundle. When you think about MHA, I don't think many things necessarily would be sold as a bundle. SoftWriters, they continue to be sold. And MHA's product branding would continue to be sold, but they're going to work in an integrated way with one another. And in many cases, some of these niche acquisitions will report to the MHA or Sunquest platform business. So that's why we suggested that they were transformational in the way that Neptune and TransCore were transformational in '03 and '04. I think we are a little surprised -- if somebody would've asked us will your next $900 million of deployment would be in one business or 6, we would have thought it would be one. But they're so great and so good that we're happy to do those. And I think there will be more smaller acquisitions that are closely correlated. Now that said, they're still all going to be individual niche businesses. We're not going to be the Fuller Brush man to hospital administrators, so there's a lot of different stuff you pull out of the bag."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast. Available -- the link for our webcast is available on our website, www.ropertech.com.
Please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information.
If you'll turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix.
For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of a purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions. The total of this is about $1.9 million, which is an add-back to both revenue and to operating profit.
As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have recognized. This is solely as a result of our acquisition that requires us to have this revenue adjustment.
And now if you'll please turn to the next slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

We're delighted to be bringing this morning's call to you as Roper Technologies for the first time. We changed the name after the market closed on Friday. The ticker symbol is going to remain the same at ROP. The way the New York Stock Exchange works on name changes is it takes perhaps 2 days here for the trades to go in as Roper Technologies, but you're certainly available to buy the stock today.
You can expect to begin trading on Wednesday, we believe, in the Roper Tech. And John mentioned, it's R-O-P-E-R-T-E-C-H dot com now for the website. That's been changed over the weekend. I think the link to these slides are on it. If you're having any trouble with normal feeds, you can go there.
And the reason for Roper Technologies is sort of obvious. I think for those of us that have been talking with you for the last several years, all you have to really do is look at our gross margins, which, this quarter, are 60%, to recognize that this simply is not an industrial company.
The quality of our businesses, the nature of the amount of money they reinvest to grow themselves and develop technology, the gross margins they have and their long-term growth rates reflect the idea that it really is a technology company now. And the opportunities that we have are far greater than they used to be a decade ago, when people were focused on product businesses as opposed to software and medical technologies and information networks that could become ubiquitous for niche applications.
Next slide. If we look at the first quarter enterprise results, we were able to power through any of the difficulties with oil and gas upstream stuff that people were talking about, including ourselves, going into the quarter. So we achieved record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Organic revenue was up 5%. We had established guidance at around 3% to 5% throughout the year, Q1 being strong and Q3 being strong, we think, over the course of the year on the organic side.
Growth clearly was led by Medical and Radio Frequency segments, and we'll talk specifically about those shortly. The foreign exchange cost us 3% in the quarter on revenue. Our gross margins, as I mentioned, it's 60%, which is a historical breakthrough for us. They were up 140 basis points. The operating margin was up 190 basis points, speaking again to leverage and efficiency, to 28.7%. And when you think about the amortization, the noncash amortization we have, if you looked at our EBITDA results, that's how you can see we do so well on cash. They were 33% in the quarter.
Net earnings were up 7% to $157 million, DEPS at $1.55. Much more importantly is the cash. We have the same number of shares that generate cash as generate net earnings. And our free cash flow was $250 million, up 24% in the quarter compared to the $157 million that we report on a diluted EPS basis.
We deployed $590 million on 3 great medical software companies. We'll explain those to you during the course of the morning. So we're really positioned, after Q1, which was probably going to -- we always thought it would have been the weakest quarter we had, for a record 2015.
Next slide. If we look at the income statement, in Q1, you'll see book-to-bill was 0.98. You may remember we're always talking about 0.97 to 1.03 as kind of a span. That's meaningless, it's just normalcy because we have so many different issues around when projects bid and what have you, so we're quite comfortable with that.
Revenue, as we said, was up 5% despite the 3% FX headwinds. As reported, it's 4%, but on an organic basis, it's 5%. If we look at the gross profit, one of the points I'd make, in addition to the 60% reflecting our technology platforms, it's really amazing to grow 140 basis points of gross margin in a quarter. If you were a 35% gross margin company getting it to 36%, people would be raving about it. But it's just amazing when you're at 58.6% that you can get it to 60%.
Operating income was up 11% to $249 million. We mentioned the margin, up 190 basis points, above the gross margin improvement. The earnings before tax were up 11%, but we had real tax headwinds in the first quarter compared to last year. You'll see our tax rate was up 300 basis points and that the headwind cost us $0.07 a share. Even with that, the DEPS still were $1.55 against $1.46 last year.
Next slide. If we look at our cash flow, it continues to amaze us. We compound the cash flow because, I suppose if you are using one word to describe the company anymore, it might be that they're really a compounder. Our first quarter cash flow of $260 million is a 22% increase, and we spent around $10 million in CapEx. So our free cash flow, as we said, is up 24%. The conversion rate on our free cash flow is 161%. Now that's beyond spectacular. It represents almost 29% of free cash flow to sales. But in the first quarter, we don't have U.S. tax cash payments, so it tends to be just a little bit overstated in the first quarter.
You can see, for that reason, we put the trailing 12-months free cash flow of $851 million, which is 24% of revenue and a conversion rate on a trailing 12-months basis of 130%, in, kind of keeping with our commitment that we expect it always to be above 120% over the course of the year.
We still believe strongly that cash is the best measure of performance, not some of the things that other people look at. We don't provide cash per share, but we sure think about how much the cash is year-over-year.
Next slide. The asset-light business model -- it's really critical and important, because while a lot of people talk about business systems, basically, our governance process model is our business system, and one of its core components is our focus on working capital. Here, you can see, if we just look at the last couple of years, inventory has dropped from the end of the first quarter of 2013 at 6.8% to 5.7%. In this quarter, receivables have come in a little bit. Payables and accruals are about the same as they were. So we find that our net working capital number for the end of Q1 is 5%. That's a 270 basis point improvement in just 2 years' time.
And what I think is incredibly important is, if you look at the long history of this continuous journey we've had on getting more asset-light, having much higher velocity, I looked back at where we were in the first quarter 10 years ago, in 2005, and at that time, our inventory was around 10% versus 5.7% today and receivables were 18.4%. The payables and accruals were about 14% versus 18%. So when you net those numbers, 10 years ago, we were above 14% in net working capital, and here we are now at 5%. And I can assure you that our governance process has a great deal to do with that focus.
Next slide. If we look at the financial position of the company, you can see that cash has gone up from a year ago's quarter from $500 million to $615 million. Our cash and undrawn revolver is still $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12-months EBITDA has gone up from $1.118 billion to $1.223 billion.
And what is really clear is, in the last 9 months, we've deployed $900 million in acquisitions, and yet, our gross debt ratio is exactly the same as it was a year ago at 2.1 and our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.6. So our balance sheet still has lots of room for us to continue to make acquisitions over the next 12 to 15 months, and there are a lot of exciting things that we're involved with today. So we feel the -- both the balance sheet and the pipeline are very strong.
Next slide. Here, we'll get into the specific segment detail of each of the segments. The next slide is our first quarter 2015 segment performance where you can see how the 4 lay out. They all have great gross margins and EBITDA margins. But the power of our RF and Medical Technology businesses becomes much, much clearer to people when you look at these slides.
You'll see, for instance, Medical alone in the quarter generated $135 million of EBITDA. If you added both Energy at $36 million and Industrial at $63 million together, you get $99 million. So Medical was 136% more EBITDA than those other 2 businesses combined. And if we look at RF and Medical, they represented 69% of the enterprise EBITDA compared to 30% for the Industrial and Energy businesses.
Next slide. The first segment we'll review today is the Energy System because it's -- we'll go with the smallest to largest. 
As you can see in the pie chart, the Energy business in Q1 represented 11% of Roper EBITDA. It had negative organic growth of 5% and FX cost us 5%.
The oil and gas markets were as weak as we expected. Upstream businesses, particularly on orders, were down double digits, and we don't see that really improving throughout the year. I think it will probably deteriorate a little further. Large projects remained particularly slow, which affects our Compressor Controls business and it still has decent opportunity in front of it.
But cost actions were taken in some of these businesses. They're all nimble. We have a huge advantage because we just have this asset-light footprint everywhere, so we don't have to do much around plants, but we have done a few things, investing a little less than $1 million in restructuring charges within the quarter. And that's inside the numbers, not an excluded item.
We had modest organic growth in the refinery application businesses. People seem to feel that's going to continue to improve throughout the year. Our other served markets in Energy, which represents about 40% of the segment, a couple of those businesses that were instrumentation-oriented were up and a couple of the businesses that were sensor products were down.
For the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year, we would think the oil and gas markets will remain challenging, with 20% of this business upstream and 40% in down to midstream. We wouldn't see that improving during the course of the year, but sequentially, it will get better just because Q1 is always our lowest quarter.
We think we'll have flat to modest growth in the other served markets that we have that report through the Energy Systems segment. The FX headwind should drive mid-single-digit segment decline through the balance of the year, in our opinion. But we do think we'll have stronger sequential reporting numbers in the second quarter than we did in the first. And I would point out that gross margins in Energy in the first quarter were still 55%, so this is not a business that's under siege by any stretch.
Next slide. Here, if we look at Industrial Technology, organic revenue was actually just modestly positive, 1 point of organic revenue. We had FX headwinds, which were negative 4 points in here. The share gains at Roper Pump gave us double-digit growth despite the declines in the upstream market, which is exactly what we predicted when we established the guidance.
Neptune's Toronto project is nearing a successful conclusion. It's down year-over-year. On a quarter basis, it will start to be down a little bit more than that in the second, third and fourth quarters compared to the prior year. So it's a headwind, basically, for the company.
We had growth at our Cornell Pump business that was driven by new products and niche applications that they are involved with. They may have a little bit of a tougher time with rental companies in the latter part of the year, but it's still holding up well at the moment.
Our material analysis businesses were down slightly, but we had terrific orders. In fact, all-time record orders for our Struers business in the first quarter, which was a pleasant surprise.
If we look at -- that project completion for Toronto we think should be sometime this summer. We think we'll continue to have weakness in the upstream portion of fluid handling for Roper and Cornell. The material analysis business we think will continue to improve. And given the FX headwinds, we would expect kind of mid-single-digit segment decline for the balance of the year after a little bit of positive. And this represents about 20% of the EBITDA for the enterprise.
Next slide. Here's Roper's RF Technology business. That business had organic revenue growth in the quarter of 11%. It had 1 point of FX headwind. And we actually sold a product line, which is called Black Diamond, that was a defense-oriented, rugged computer technology that really belonged in the hands of somebody that was clearly in that business. And we achieved a sale of that product line in the quarter, which added a little downward pressure, and it's been removed from the baseline.
We had very strong growth in toll and traffic. Our technology, which is trademarked Infinity Digital Lane Systems, continues to be deployed rapidly in Florida and in Texas. And bidding activity around our Infinity Lane Systems is very robust.
We had very significant tag shipments that benefited both the revenue and the operating margin. You can see the OP profit, at $74 million, was up 19% compared to the first quarter of a year ago.
And we had quite significant subscriber additions to our SaaS-based freight matching model that gave us double-digits growth. And normally, that's a business that grows sort of single digits, so that was very encouraging.
For the second part of the year, Q2 through Q4, we think the backlog is going to support the toll and traffic growth. The Riyadh project begins in earnest in the second quarter, and our tag shipment strength that we expect to continue with kind of known places for deployment.
Our Software and SaaS businesses we think will grow mid-single digits, but they do give us very, very outstanding cash returns, so modest growth there. It's always worth a lot of cash. And we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment for the balance for the year.  And you can see RF represents 27% of our EBITDA here on the pie.
Next slide. If you look at Medical solutions, Medical was up 15% in revenue and 22% operating profit, and OP margin was up 230 basis points to 37.3%. And there's a lot of noncash amortization in Medical. If I look at the EBITDA margin, it's 44.9%, so truly outstanding businesses. Organic revenue was up 7%. We've got the 3 points of negative FX in there.
Our MHA business had double-digit growth that was really driven by market conditions and new customer additions that we've gotten, as they continue to focus on building that platform. We had double-digit growth at our Verathon product business. We've got a series of product introductions we talked about last year, all of which are doing well. And we continue to build out their channel to get better coverage.
Sunquest's growth continued despite a difficult comparison. Last year, we had considerable revenue as a result of implementing meaningful use programs. So one thing is to sell the software, but implementation is a different -- a diverse revenue stream, and that heightened last year's numbers, so it will be difficult as a comp throughout this year. But the underlying recurring revenue continues to grow nicely.
The Scientific Imaging businesses were pretty flat here. As you'll notice, we're really calling out the segment as Medical Solutions because the Scientific Imaging portion really is down pretty much to microscopy applications. There's not a lot of stuff here to talk about anymore.
We did deploy $590 million of investment in 3 great medical software acquisitions for the Medical Solutions business. We'll explain those in a moment. For the balance of the year, we think MHA is going to continue to benefit from favorable market conditions. Most of us appear to be getting older, and there are a wide variety of people to provide services to. And the execution that MHA has is really, really world-class.
Sunquest we think is going to continue to perform well against those difficult comps I mentioned above. And Sunquest has a great deal of initiatives around 2016 that are gaining momentum, certainly did in the first quarter and are continuing now. Some of those we can't really talk a lot about because they're proprietary, but they're very exciting development opportunities for Sunquest.
The Medical products growth we think will be led by Verathon and Northern Digital in the last 3 quarters, as their pace picks up particularly there. We think we'll get mid-teens revenue growth for the segment. And the acquisitions that we made in the quarter are really going to help our future growth because there are synergies in the marketplace as they coordinate more with Sunquest and MHA in the future.
Next slide. If we look at these 3 health care IT acquisitions, these are all software companies. The first, Strata Decision Technology, is in Chicago, has a great leader, a wonderful team. They're really providing subscription financial analytics and performance platforms for hospitals. These enterprise-wide things are really around the effectiveness in cost-reduction opportunities for hospitals and decision support so that they can kind of think of themselves a little bit more like the rest of us think about cost and continuous improvement, and the technology is really spectacular.
Now they're already in 1 out of  5 U.S. hospitals with one or more of their applications, but they're very early stage for the new applications that have been developed, which is part of the reason we -- they really needed to be acquired by somebody like us who can rapidly invest in the development of those.
SoftWriters is a business that's going to be coordinated with MHA. It's in the long-term care pharmacy space. It provides enterprise software for people who do that work. It has on-premise software delivery models that get recurred billing. E-prescriptions are something that rapidly is growing, and this facilitates that. They have the exact same customer base really as MHA, so the 2 together are going to create a better service footprint for customers.
In Data Innovations, this is a business that will closely align with Sunquest. It's the largest clinical and blood laboratory middleware provider. And if you think about middleware, you might think about you having to download your printer driver to get your laptop or CPU to print properly. Well, Data Innovations, for want of a better way to explain it, is really the ability to connect, to communicate between lab instruments and the tests that are deployed, and then that information showing up where the hospital needs to have it. The -- Data Innovations has the largest library, with over 1,000 laboratory devices, types of devices, connected all over the world. They're deployed in 80 countries. And you can just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tests and feedback that are required to the clinical use of the data that they're interacting with. This adds a lot to our Sunquest capabilities in the hospital laboratory markets, and both companies should be better as a result of the synergies that we get out of this transaction.
Next slide would be to update our guidance. When we look at the -- I'm sorry, the next slide. If we look at the second quarter and the full year guidance, we're raising the guidance from $6.70 to $6.75 on the low end, up to $6.95 at the high end. Unfortunately, the FX headwinds are much greater. We started the year with using the year-end number, and that created a $0.10 drag. That's now up to a $0.25 drag as a result of where the currencies are at the end of the first quarter.
Our tax rate we still expect to be sort of 30% to 31%, a little higher than it was in the first quarter. Organic growth we think will still be in the 3% to 5% thing, with Q1 being strong; Q3, on organic, should be strong; second quarter, probably not as strong; and the fourth quarter, if we get normal year-end activity, should be pretty strong again.
We're going to raise our full year cash flow to $925 million. And we established guidance in the second quarter of $1.59 to $1.64, which recognizes the FX challenge that we'll have there.
Next slide. If we look then at the summary, before we open it for questions, we had basically record results across the board in the quarter, which is a nice way to start out with Roper Technologies. Organic growth at 5%, with Medical and RF driving mostly all of it. Operating margins at astonishing records at 28.7% and free cash flow, up 24% to $250 million, demonstrating the importance of focusing on how much cash people generate versus sometimes people looking too much on the net earnings number.
We deployed $590 million on our 3 great acquisitions. The pipeline is terrific. We have a lot of things open that we're interested in and several things that we're really excited about. We do think we'll have a record year in 2015, just powering through the end-market challenges we have in some of our businesses. And we were able to raise our DEPS and cash flow guidance, even though the FX headwinds increased by another $0.15 a share.
So with that, we'd like to open it up for questions for the first time for Roper Technologies."

And that came live in the second half of last year and has been building. So we have a favorable comp in the first half of this year, where that continues to go up. The upstream business on core pump technology was okay in the first quarter, but we expect it to be off throughout the remainder of the year. And in the second half of the year, we'll circle up with the comps from last year. So it will still be better than a year ago, and it helps us, at the expense of certain other people that were making those products. In addition, these drill things get relined, so that's like a continuous thing that happens no matter what the level of new drilling is, you get the relining, and that's a significant business. So it's just what we do in Houston. So all that's good, but you still have to moderate that with the fact that the absolute core portion of the upstream pump business will decline throughout the year."

So we have very niche applications where, in many cases, we're the only person who can really provide the solution that's being required. So as we went through all of our quarterly reviews, that's one of the things that we did ask about and test. But so far, that's not a concern for us. I think that's also reflected in the fact that the gross margin continues to be very strong inside both the Energy and Industrial segments, where it was 55% in Energy and 50% in Industrial. So that's really the proof with respect to price. If that's holding well, then gross margins generally will hold well."

And then secondly, just within the margin profile this quarter, I saw that your operating margins were down about 200 basis points. I know part of that was the restructuring. But what else really kind of drove the decline in operating margins on the Energy business?"

If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18%, and if you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pull the one-time expenses associated with restructuring out of that, and you get down into the mid-30% range for the decremental leverage. That's not at all different than what we would expect. We actually think that's very impressive performance out of those businesses, given that they start with 55% gross margin. So there's real cost actions, real belt tightening that has to happen and that will happen, and as  -- and will continue to happen in order to be able to hold that decremental leverage in the mid-30% to 40% range. Now as far as going forward, when you think about sequential improvement a little bit throughout the year, like I said, it's really driven by the non-oil and gas portion. So our things that are selling into, whether it be plastics or polymers or nondestructive testing, other markets that are not oil and gas-related, which is about 40% of the segment, that was down modestly in the first quarter. We expect that to be up modestly as we go forward throughout the year. And then the other piece is the timing associated with some of the project deliveries at CCC, which most of those are for downstream and midstream applications, more downstream, frankly. And those are things that we expect to come to fruition later in the year. So those are the drivers for why we expect the minus 5% organic in the first quarter to be closer to flat throughout the rest of the year."

If I think about -- a lot of your businesses, historically, they've kind of been portfolio companies and have not particularly integrated.

It's kind of dizzying to think about how many software systems a hospital might have if you think about all this different things you're starting to put together. I guess the nature of my question really is, is there a significant opportunity to do that?

If you think about Neptune, we never added anything to it, except they wanted to have this rugged mobile DAT business that we rolled over on and it never really went anywhere. In TransCore's case, we have made acquisitions that have been very strategic. Several years ago, we acquired this company called United Toll. Well, United Toll has become the entire technology leadership position around the world on toll and traffic with this Infinity Lane Systems. A very critical acquisition we made. And it's kind of fully integrated and gets sold as a bundle. When you think about MHA, I don't think many things necessarily would be sold as a bundle. SoftWriters, they continue to be sold. And MHA's product branding would continue to be sold, but they're going to work in an integrated way with one another. And in many cases, some of these niche acquisitions will report to the MHA or Sunquest platform business. So that's why we suggested that they were transformational in the way that Neptune and TransCore were transformational in '03 and '04. I think we are a little surprised -- if somebody would've asked us will your next $900 million of deployment would be in one business or 6, we would have thought it would be one. But they're so great and so good that we're happy to do those. And I think there will be more smaller acquisitions that are closely correlated. Now that said, they're still all going to be individual niche businesses. We're not going to be the Fuller Brush man to hospital administrators, so there's a lot of different stuff you pull out of the bag."

We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.ropertech.com. 
Please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of of the that information. 
Now if you please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and our recent softer acquisitions, including Data Innovations, SHP, SoftWriters, FoodLink and Strata for about $2.5 million. 
As a reminder, this represents revenue that absent our acquisitions, those businesses would have recognized.

We'll start off going through our second quarter enterprise financial results and then look at the detailed activity within the 4 segments and the outlook for the rest of 2015, and then take questions and answers from the audience. 
So next slide. As you can see here, a summary of the second quarter, we achieved all-time second quarter records for orders for revenue per net earnings for EBITDA, both on [indiscernible] on a percentage basis and cash flow and margins were really quite outstanding. 
Revenue was up 1% to $892 million. Organic was flat, but the FX headwinds were 3% in the quarter. We had 13% growth in medical and 12% in RF, but we'll talk more about those 2 areas, sort of mid-single digit organic growth going forward, and then additional benefits from acquisitions. 
We had declines in industrial at 9% and Energy in 12%. A lot of that is foreign exchange, as you'll see, but our oil and gas arena was down a little over 20% in the second quarter, which was up about on par, a little bit worse than we had an expected, and we don't really see an improvement in that balance of the year might get slightly worse. 
Gross margins despite the end market headwinds were up 100 basis points and reached 60.1%. Our operating margins were up 60 basis points to hit 28.5%, which is truly outstanding margin improvement in this environment. 
Net earnings were up 10% to $173 million and DEPS represented $1.70 and, of course, we cover, as always, $40 million of noncash amortization in there. 
Free cash flow was up 24% to $162 million, so these really are record results despite the foreign exchange headwinds and the end market difficult. Next slide. 
Here, we'll look at the quarter 2 income statement. You can see book-to-bill was 0.99 in each of the segments, it was sort of 1.01 to 0.98 or something, so orders were quite consistent with revenue. 
Revenue was, as we said, affected by 3% on FX there, but up 1% overall. Gross profit up 100 basis-point, operating margin 60. I can see an effect, the benefits we had that we had planned throughout the year on a state tax matter, which has been resolved as we expected. We thought it might have occurred at a later point in time, but it's impossible to know when it hit this quarter. So lower our tax rate from the 30.4% of last year to 25.7% this year and that certainly helped the net earnings being up by 10%. 
Next slide. Here, we look at that continuing compounding nature of how we grow cash flow. So in the second quarter, our operating cash flow was $173 million, which was a 23% increase over last year's second quarter results. Our free cash flow was $162 million, a 24% increase over last year. And for the first of of the year now, we've delivered $412 million in free cash flow, which represents a little over 23% of revenue and gives us a cash conversion ratio of 126%. 
And when you think about the compounding nature of us being able to reinvest our cash and transactions that give us still more cash, you can look at 2013 in the first half, we had $311 million and just in the 2-year period, we're up 39% in half 1 to $433 million, so we still think that cash measurement is far and away the most important thing for people to look at when you're looking at the quality of the company's performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues to improve. Our working capital was a function of our second quarter annualized net sales is down to 4%.  Two years ago, that number was 7.5% and people would consistently ask us how you can possibly keep at 7.5%, and we chose not to, but we got it better. First, we cut it in half. So very nice reductions in inventory from 6.3% of revenue 2 years ago to 5.5% now, and that's at the time when there were some considerable destocking in the oil and gas arena, which certainly didn't help us on inventories. 
In receivables, they've dropped from 19.7% to 16.6% and at the beginning of the quarter, given the difficulties, a lot of energy went into reinforcing our disciplined process as around receivables. Because as you know, in periods like this, you can have some sloppy activity around getting paid. 
And then if we take our inventory at 5.5% in receivables at 16.6% and we subtract the payables of 18.1%, you can see our total net working capital there is 4%. 
Next slide. If we look at the overall financial position at the company, our cash increased from a year ago at $679 million versus $565 million. Our end drawn revolver and the cash together gave us almost $1.9 billion in powder. The reality is we can easily increase that because of our debt ratio, as you can see, our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to $1.232 billion and while our gross debt-to-EBITDA is 2, our net that fact David is only 1.5. We have deployed $1 billion in acquisitions in the last 12 months, and we have a very active pipeline. now we did announce one acquisition, we'll talk about when we get to the RF segment, but there are others that were far along and working on. 
Next slide. Here, we'll discuss the individual nature of our segments. So the next slide. If we look at the 4 segments here, you can see that second quarter revenue in the blue chart and the green chart being the second quarter EBITDA. And so now you have really RF and Medical, representing a little over 70% of the total EBITDA that Roper is generating, and they do that at very high EBITDA margins. 
Our energy EBITDA in industrial tech, if you put the 2 together to $100 million of EBITDA at 331 in revenue. So even in a more difficult end market with FX pressures, we created EBITDA margins in the second quarter of 30%. The nice thing about the 70% EBITDA from RF and Medical is those businesses are continuing to grow at mid-single digits organically, and they give us higher leverage on the next dollar of revenue than our energy and industrial businesses do. 
Next slide. We look specifically at energy systems. It was down 12% on revenue versus last year second quarter, but I pointed that was due to foreign exchange and 7 points on organic. 
Deleveraging here was very well managed. You see the operating profit margin in the quarter was 26% gross margins remain above 55%, and we de-lever that only about a 34% ratio. So once again, they've been able to take their variable cost structure immediately adjust it. 
The oil and gas markets were weaker than we expected, particularly in those areas directly related to fracking. Our DESV business, the Diesel Engine Shutoff Valve business was down 50% and when we get to industrial, you'll see Roper Pump had some difficult things as well. 
The other market, some of which are industrial that we reported in energy all were satisfactory, generally flat, a little bit of improvement in one place or another. 
The business executed terrifically well in the segment in the quarter. They took some additional cost actions about $1 million in restructuring, which is included in our results around excluding it. This demonstrates the benefit of having very fixed view fixed assets so we never have to work around absorption issues like others do and we get a very quick payback on variable cost take outs. We've got about 150 employees in our oil and gas space between Energy and a little bit in Roper and Cornell Pump. 
For the second half of the year, we don't really see any kind of forecast improvement in oil and gas markets. It's kind of a mixed bag. If you listen to various people, I guess, if we were going to say will it get better at worst, we'd be planning that they're getting worse and not better, but we expect them to be pretty much the way they were in the second quarter. 
We expect to get some modest growth in underserved markets that these businesses have that are not in the oil and gas arena. And we think that FX headwinds are unfortunately going to continue to persist, much as they did in the second quarter. 
We think we'll have sort of high single digit organic decline for the rest of the year, but then gives us really easy comps for 2016. 
Next slide. We look at industrial, industrial continues to perform incredibly on a margin basis. Their gross margins in the quarter were over 50%, their operating margins were over 28%. They were down 9% on revenue, but 5% of that is foreign exchange and all the rest of it is virtually the fact that our Toronto project in Canada with Neptune is winding down, and they did very little in the second quarter, in fact, it was down $8 million in the second quarter versus last year. So the rest of the business actually performed find. It would have been flat to modestly up. 
Our oil and gas markets, again, were weaker than expected. Roper Pump saw some destocking activity in the surface pumps. Their revenue was down close to 80%,  but the Realign business was up twice as much as it had been the year before, so those products continue to be consumed in the ongoing activity of that technology that we've introduced. 
Rental markets for flow control as it relates to the upstream oil and gas was, of course, not good at all. 
Our Material Analysis business, Struers, had a very, very fine quarter. They were up more than double digits organic growth. On a constant-currency basis was up incredibly and still up more than 10% even adjusted for currency. 
As the Neptune project sort of -- it appears to us is virtually complete, we're only being asked to do odds and ends now, so that was a negative headwind of $8 million in the quarter. 
At the rest of Neptune, fortunately, was continuing to grow and look start like must be continuing to gain share. 
In the second half of the year, we don't really see any improvements as we've said around oil and gas markets. I don't think they get worse here, they'll likely to get a little bit of favorable increase. Roper Pump was a little slower than the rest of our businesses to react, so we've now cut about 40 people in flow control where the end markets have required that, so we think we'll get a little bit better deleverage performance out of them in the second half of the year than we got in the second quarter. 
Our Material Analysis business, there's no sign of weakening in any way. It's continuing to do really well. 
Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S. market. The Toronto project headwind in the second half for us is going to be about $20 million, it's about $30 million for the full year and that's the thing that happened sort of these kind of projects, they aren't those big ones that happen very often and they're working on a few. But the core U.S. business will have positive growth this year. So we think we'll have kind of mid-single digit organic decline for the second. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the RF business, you'll see we had revenue of $256 million, which represents organic growth of 6%. Actually, the organic growth would have been a little bit better. You can see in that topline, the FX is down 1 and divestiture is 1. You might remember in the first quarter, we sold our Black Diamond rugged mobile business and that was a little over $4 million drag on revenue in the second quarter for us. 
We had terrific results in our toll and traffic business and growth continues to expand. We've got multiple projects for upgrades that are in quotation now. We probably really never had a better forward-looking opportunity than we do today with toll and traffic. 
The Riyadh traffic project started up in the second quarter and already has resulted in several change orders and extensions that we think will benefit us, particularly in '16 and perhaps yet this year. 
We had double-digit growth in our tag sales for tolling. The software subscriber additions continued to grow nicely in our freight matching business. We have 3 of those, 1 in the East, 1 in the West and 1 in Canada. 
The strength in our RF product line businesses were -- was excellent particularly attendance for senior care, submetering for apartment, multifamily housing and the U.K. water application business Technolog did well as a result as well. 
For the second half, we still have that little Black Diamond headwind in the second half, it will be several million dollars, it doesn't repeat. But on the other hand, it didn't contribute any positive income, so it doesn't have any effect on them. 
We've got backlog and proposal activity in toll and traffic, as I said, sort of an all-time high with lots of long-term opportunities there. We don't see any pullback in our subscriber growth in our software businesses, whether they're licensed or SaaS. And we acquired On Center Software, which is in The Woodlands in Houston, Texas, very nice business, well managed by Cecilia Padilla. It's a really, again, a business that has higher EBITDA margins than Roper's base business. It's been growing at very solid double digits revenue, but we actually think it's been underinvested in to support even faster growth, and that business only just closed on Monday, so we're just getting started talking with them about how to enhance their growth profile. 
We think we'll get mid-single digit organic growth for the segment in RF, but total revenue, including acquisitions would be a little better. 
Next slide. Here if we look at medical solutions, you can see, once again, you got a little story about us pruning businesses. We got rid really exited our rugged mobile product line, that's in addition to the Black Diamond rugged mobile business, which was a little military app. This was a $5 million drag in the second quarter, and that's another $7 million drag for the balance of the year. So the right thing to do this at the time to do it, it wasn't contributing any income. The technology portion if we want, we embedded inside our MTech business, so that's really important for us. Organic revenue shows up at 2%, but if you adjust it for the rugged mobile discontinuance, organic revenue would have been higher. FX was a 3% headwind in the quarter from medical. But overall, you can see revenue grew at 13% even with those issues and operating profit was up 18% and operating margin, that's not EBITDA, operating margin was 36.6%. 
We had very strong performance out of Managed Health Care Associates. They continue to gain share, of course, they have their favorable market conditions as aging continues in the population, but just terrific results. 
Double-digit growth in our Medical Device businesses, Verathon was very strong, Northern Digital is very strong and our Cisco, multimodality business was very strong. 
Sunquest, recurring revenue growth was, as expected, is quite good, but we did have lower license I service sales in the quarter because of the meaningful use sort of take through the Python that occurred in 2014, so sort of a hopeless comp, but that will change pretty quickly as you'll see. 
Q1 acquisitions, all at 3 of them, the Strata business, the SoftWriters and Data Innovations performed very well. In fact, sort of the 3 together were above expectations. And I mentioned that we exited the rugged mobile product line finally. 
In the second half of the year, you can see that we expect MHA to continue to benefit from the market conditions and their ability to execute against that. We see additional medical products out of Verathon as they launch several things in Europe that are new to the continent and Northern Digital expands in its sphere business. 
The scientific imaging businesses is basically flat. Sometimes, they look worse than they are because they've had that rugged mobile business in it for quite a long time and for that gone, that gives us a little better headway for variable performance in the future. We think we'll get mid-single digit organic growth out of the segment, but, of course, much higher total revenue growth. And then Sunquest has got a very nice opportunity that mostly benefits us in 2016, but a lot of software module upgrades now that the meaningful use process has subside with the hospitals, the same people that were involved in those, both at the hospital and that our level are able to look and enhance growth as they do product upgrades, software upgrades for various applications within the hospital. 
Next slide. Here we get to the guidance nature of what we think through balance of the year. Next slide. 
For the full year, we were at -- we're establishing guidance at $6.61 to $6.75, the midpoint would be $6.68. Previously, we were at $6.75 to $6.95. The midpoint is $6.85. And we really decided to take that down because with -- we thought we had organic growth of at least 3%, but it looks like it's more 1% to 2% because of the depth of how much the oil and gas upstream markets really come down. We said at the beginning, the [indiscernible] upstream is about 5% of the business last year and about 14% for oil and gas in total. Now, oil and gas is down to 12%. As you might expect as the rest of the business is growing and the upstream portion will continue to climb as a function of total revenue. 
Will get mid-single digit growth out of Medical and RF organically, but we'll get got additional revenue because of the acquisition that we already have and others that are possibly going to occur. 
In oil and gas, we think that's going to continue to be weak. We think it's going to look much like the second quarter, so we don't see much of a recovery in any of those end markets. 
Our tax rate for the year we said at the beginning of the year , we thought it would be about 30.5%. We still think it would be about 30.5%. The discrete item that we had in the second quarter around state sales tax was something we expect to have and it was in our guidance for the full year, but it did move forward in the second quarter. 
Full year operating cash flow, we're saying should be around $925 million. In addition to our net earnings, we had about $160 million of noncash amortization. Our Q3 earnings, which should be just purely the net earnings with DEPS numbers, 1.53 to 1.57. Pressures for the year that we have to keep overcoming that we've done largely led by foreign exchange and then quite a bit from oil and gas, now that Toronto headwind and then some modest changes in imaging and Industrial. 
Had a pretty strong June compared to April and May, so we're a little bit encouraged in that respect. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the second quarter summary, once again, we have to really complement our operating people who acted very nimbly in terms of what was happening in the upstream oil and gas segment. Their ability to change variable cost is always just world-class. They add really terrific execution in the meantime, we wind up with record quarters and revenue net earnings and EBITDA for the quarter. And revenue certainly was hurt by the headwinds of FX, but, notwithstanding that, we sort of powered through at a very favorable way, acquisitions were up 4 and that offset the headwinds. And Medical and RF were up so much, they offset the decline in industrial and energy, which was led by that oil and gas problem. 
Gross margins actually increased in the quarter. It was pretty amazing starting out at 59.1, and you could still improve gross margins in the quarter that's organically flat. That says a lot about the quality operating people we had in place. 
Our operating margins were up to 28.5%, EBITDA margins at 33.9%. Net earnings we've covered before, free cash flow up 24% in the quarter. First acquisition that we've announced would have been in the quarter, it didn't get down the 20th of July was On Center, and we've got an active pipeline and we would expect to close some additional transactions before the end of the year. And in reflection, we just see the core as being very pleased given the FX and selected end market difficulty in terms of how we performed. 
So with that, I think we ready to open up for questions, John."

If you go back, and you look at how would this segments were in the second quarter of '09 and compared to second quarter '09 to the second quarter of '08 and then you look at the comparison of the second quarter of '15 and the second quarter of '14, you see kind of the rates have changed, you'd be astonished how much better all these are. The thing that is an amazing in the second quarter of '09, are Industrial tech business, which is largely Neptune and flow control. It had $32.5 million of operating profit on a reported basis, and that was on a $136 million of revenue. So it's margin, it was 23.8% in OP at the time that people were concerned the world was ending. This time, this reduction, our OP and industrial is $52.2 million, not $32.5 million, and our revenue is $186 million, not $136 million. So we have now OP margins of 28% in industrial in the quarter versus 23.8% in the second quarter of '09.. And it's nothing like the second quarter of '09 in terms of the rate of deescalation. Second quarter of '09 over '08, our sales in the flow control segments were down 25.5%, OP was down 31.7%. We went through a lot of currency issues either. This time, our revenue was down 9%, not 25% and our OP was down 13%, not 32%. And if you look at the Energy segment, the Energy segment in the second quarter of '09 had $23 million of OP on $105 million in revenues so it had OP margins of 22%. This time, it got $37.7 million in OP on $145 million in revenue. So the margins are 26%, up 400 basis points from the second quarter of '09. The sales trend in '09 versus '08 was down 27%. At this time,  it's 12.5% of that is FX and and OP was down 35%. This time, it's down 15%. So entirely different and then it's always for us painful because people ask these questions about these 2 businesses, which represents less than 30% of our EBITDA. Roper, let's go toe Medical. Medical in the second quarter of '09, we had $12.4 million of OP on $76 million of revenue, 16.3%. This quarter, Medical had $109 million in OP, 8x, 9x the number on $302 million in revenue. And it wasn't down, it was up 12% on sales, it was up 16% on OP. Our margin in medical was 36.1% versus last year's second quarter of 16.3%. Our challenge is simply to continue to grow these things as well as we can. In our RF segment, in 2009, the second quarter had $39 million of OP on $187 million in revenue, so our margin profile was 21.1%. Today, RF had $79.9 million, double OP, and it had 255.6% in revenues. So sales were up 4%, it really up more than organically. And the OP was up dramatically, so you're looking at margins of 31.3% versus 21.1%. In total, Roper in the second quarter, when people thought the business was ending, had $96 million of OP on $505 million in revenue, 19%. This quarter, had $252 million in OP on $890 million in revenue, 28.3%, so we're up 930 basis points quarter-over-quarter and the as reported GAAP OP number. So yet there's a sharp reduction. Yes, we got rid of 150 people. Yes, the investment in that restructuring will turn cash positive in the fourth quarter and no, we're not really worried about it."

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.ropertech.com. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Now if you please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, including Data Innovations, SHP, SoftWriters, FoodLink and Strata for about $2.5 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisitions, those businesses would have recognized. 
Now if you'll please turn the slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

So n",3561,"Thank you, John. We'll start off going through our second quarter enterprise financial results and then look at the detailed activity within the 4 segments and the outlook for the rest of 2015, and then take questions and answers from the audience. 
So next slide. You can see here a summary of the second quarter. We achieved all-time second quarter records for orders for revenue for net earnings for EBITDA, both nominally and a percentage basis and cash flow, and margins were really quite outstanding. 
Revenue was up 1% to $892 million. Organic was flat, but the FX headwinds were 3% in the quarter. We had 13% growth in medical and 4% in RF, but we'll talk more about those 2 areas, sort of mid-single-digit organic growth going forward and then additional benefits from acquisitions. We had declines in industrial at 9% and energy in 12%. A lot of that is foreign exchange, as you'll see, but our oil and gas arena was down a little over 20% in the second quarter, which was up about on par, a little bit worse than we had an expected. And we don't really see any improvement in that. For the balance of the year, it might get slightly worse. 
Gross margins, despite the end-market headwinds, were up 100 basis points and reached 60.1%. Our operating margins were up 60 basis points to hit 28.5%, which is truly outstanding margin improvement in this environment. Net earnings were up 10% to $173 million and DEPS represented $1.70. And of course, we cover, as always, about $40 million of noncash amortization in there. Free cash flow was up 24% to $162 million, so these really are record results despite the foreign exchange headwind and the end market difficult. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the quarter 2 income statement. You can see book-to-bill was 0.99 in without -- in each of the segments, it was sort of 1.01 to 0.98 or something, so orders were quite consistent with revenue. Revenue was, as we said, affected by 3% on FX there, but up 1% overall. Gross profit, up 100 basis point; operating margin, 60%. You can see an effect, the benefit we had that we had planned throughout the year on a state tax matter, which has been resolved as we expected. We thought it might have occurred at a later point in time, but it's impossible to know when it hit this quarter. So it lowered our tax rate from the 30.4% of last year to 25.7% this year and that certainly helped the net earnings being up 10%. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the continuing compounding nature of how we grow cash flow. So in the second quarter, our operating cash flow was $173 million, which was a 23% increase over last year's second quarter results. Our free cash flow was $162 million, a 24% increase over last year. And for the first half of the year now, we've delivered $412 million in free cash flow, which represents a little over 23% of revenue and gives us a cash conversion ratio of 126%. 
And when you think about the compounding nature of us being able to reinvest our cash in transactions that give us still more cash, you can look at 2013 in the first half, we had $311 million. And just in the 2-year period, we're up 39% in half 1 to $433 million. So we still think that cash measurement is far and away the most important thing for people to look at when you're looking at the quality of a company's performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues to improve. Our working capital as a function of our second quarter annualized net sales is down to 4%. 2 years ago, that number was 7.5% and people would consistently ask us how you can possibly keep it at 7.5%, and we chose not to, but we got it better. First, we cut it in half. So very nice reductions in the inventory from 6.3% of revenue 2 years ago to 5.5% now. And that's at a time when there were some considerable destocking in the oil and gas arena, which certainly didn't help us with the inventories. 
In receivables, they've dropped from 19.7% to 16.6%. And at the beginning of the quarter, given the difficulties, a lot of energy went into reinforcing our discipline processes around receivables. Because as you know, in periods like this, you can have some sloppy activity around getting paid. And then if we take our inventory at 5.5% and receivables at 16.6% and we subtract the payables of 18.1%, you can see our total net working capital there is 4%. 
Next slide. If we look at the overall financial position of the company, our cash increased from a year ago at $679 million versus $565 million. Our undrawn revolver and the cash together gave us almost $1.9 billion in powder. The reality is we can easily increase that because of our debt ratio. As you can see, our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to $1.232 billion and while our gross debt-to-EBITDA is 2, our net debt-to-EBITDA is only 1.5. 
We have deployed $1 billion in acquisitions in the last 12 months, and we have a very active pipeline now. We did announce one acquisition we'll talk about when we get to the RF segment, but there are others that we're far along and working on. 
Next slide. Here, we'll discuss the individual nature of our segments. 
So the next slide. If we look at the 4 segments here, you can see the second quarter revenue in the blue chart and the green chart being the second quarter EBITDA. And so now you have really RF and medical representing a little over 70% of the total EBITDA that Roper is generating, and they do that at very high EBITDA margins. 
Our energy EBITDA and Industrial Tech, if you put the 2 together, it's $100 million of EBITDA and $331 million in revenue. So even in a more difficult end market with FX pressures, we created EBITDA margins in the second quarter of 30%. The nice thing about the 70% EBITDA from RF and medical is those businesses are continuing to grow at mid-single digits organically, and they give us higher leverage on the next dollar of revenue than our energy and industrial businesses do. 
Next slide. We look specifically at energy systems. It was down 12% on revenue versus last year's second quarter, but I pointed that was due to foreign exchange and 7 points on organic. 
Deleveraging here was very well managed. You see the operating profit margin in the quarter was 26%. Gross margins remained above 55%, and we delevered at only about a 34% ratio. So once again, they've been able to take their variable cost structure and immediately adjust it. 
The oil and gas markets were weaker than we expected, particularly in those areas directly related to fracking. Our DESV [ph] business, the diesel engine shut-off valve business, was down 50%. And when we get to industrial, you'll see Roper Pump had some difficult things as well. The other market, some of which are industrial, that we report in energy, all were satisfactory, generally flat, a little bit of improvement in one place or another. 
The business executed terrifically well in the segment in the quarter. They took some additional cost actions, about $1 million in restructuring, which is included in our results. We're not excluding it. This demonstrates the benefit of having very few fixed assets, so we never have to work around absorption issues like others do and we get a very quick payback on variable cost takeouts. We've cut about 150 employees in our oil and gas space between energy and a little bit in Roper and Cornell Pump. 
For the second half of the year, we don't really see any kind of forecast improvement in oil and gas markets. There's kind of a mixed bag. If you listen to various people, I guess, if we were going to say would it get better or worst, we'd be planning that they're getting worse and not better. But we expect them to be pretty much the way they were in the second quarter. We expect to get some modest growth in other served markets that these businesses have that are not in the oil and gas arena. And we think that the FX headwinds are unfortunately going to continue to persist, much as they did in the second quarter. We think we'll have sort of high single-digit organic decline for the rest of the year, but then it gives us really easy comps for 2016. 
Next slide. We look at industrial. Industrial continues to perform incredibly on a margin basis. Their gross margins in the quarter were over 50%. Our operating margins were over 28%. They were down 9% on revenue, but 5% of that is foreign exchange. And all of the rest of it is virtually the fact that our Toronto project in Canada with Neptune is winding down, and they did very little in the second quarter. In fact, it was down $8 million in the second quarter versus last year. So the rest of the business actually performed fine. It would have been flat to modestly up. 
Our oil and gas markets, again, were weaker than expected. Roper Pump saw some destocking activity in their surface pumps. Their revenue was down close to 80%, but their reline business [ph] was up twice as much as it had been the year before. So those products continue to be consumed in the ongoing activity of that technology that we've introduced. Rental market for flow control as it relates to the upstream oil and gas was, of course, not good at all. 
Our material analysis business, Struers, had a -- just a very, very fine quarter. They were up more than double digits organic growth. On a constant-currency basis, it was up incredibly and still up more than 10% even adjusted for currency. 
As the Neptune project sort of -- it appears to us as virtually complete. We're only being asked to do odds and ends now, so that was a negative headwind of $8 million in the quarter. The rest of Neptune, fortunately, was continuing to grow and looks to us like must be continuing to gain share. 
In the second half of the year, we don't really see any improvements, as we've said, around oil and gas markets. I don't think they get worse here. Likely, they get a little bit of favorable increase. Roper Pump was a little slower than the rest of our businesses to react, so we've now cut about 40 people in flow control where the end markets have required that. So we think we'll get a little bit better deleverage performance out of them in the second half of the year than we got in the second quarter. Our material analysis business, there's no signs of it weakening in any way. It's continuing to do really very well. 
Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S. market. The Toronto project headwind in the second half for us is going to be about $20 million. It's about $30 million for the full year, and that's the thing that happens with these kind of projects. There aren't those big ones that happen very often and they're working on a few. But the core U.S. business will have positive growth this year. So we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic decline for the segment. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the RF business, you'll see we had revenue of $256 million, which represented organic growth of 6%. Actually, the organic growth would have been a little bit better. You can see in that top line, FX is down 1% and divestiture is 1%. You might remember in the first quarter, we sold our Black Diamond rugged mobile business and that was a little over a $4 million drag on revenue in the second quarter for us. 
We had terrific results in our toll and traffic business and growth continues to expand. We've got multiple projects for upgrades that are in quotation now. We probably really never had a better forward-looking opportunity than we do today with toll and traffic. 
The Riyadh traffic project started up in the second quarter and already has resulted in several change orders and extensions that we think will benefit us, particularly in '16 and perhaps yet this year. We had double-digit growth in our tag sales for tolling. The software subscriber additions continued to grow nicely in our freight matching business. We have 3 of those, 1 in the east, 1 in the west and 1 in Canada. 
The strength in our RF product line businesses were -- was excellent, particularly pendants for senior care; sub-metering for apartment, multifamily housing; and the U.K. water application business, Technolog, did well as a result as well. 
For the second half, we still have that little Black Diamond headwind in the second half. It will be several million dollars. It doesn't repeat. But on the other hand, it didn't contribute any positive income, so it doesn't have any effect on that. 
We've got backlog in proposal activity in toll and traffic, as I said, sort of at an all-time high with lots of long-term opportunities there. We don't see any pullback in our subscriber growth in our software businesses, whether they're licensed or SaaS. And we acquired On Center Software, which is in The Woodlands in Houston, Texas. A very nice business, well managed by Cecilia Padilla. It's a really, again, a business that has higher EBITDA margins than Roper's base business. It's been growing at very solid double-digit revenue, but we actually think it's been underinvested in to support even faster growth. And that business only just closed on Monday, so we're just getting started talking with them about how to enhance their growth profile. 
We think we'll get mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment in RF. But total revenue, including acquisitions would be a little better. 
Next slide. Here if we look at medical solutions, you can see once again, you got a little story about us pruning businesses. We got rid -- really exited our rugged mobile product line. That's in addition to the Black Diamond rugged mobile business, which was a little military app. This was a $5 million drag in the second quarter, and it's another $7 million drag for the balance of the year, so right thing to do. This is the time to do it. It wasn't contributing any income. The technology portion that we want, we've embedded inside our Amtech business, so that's really important for us. Organic revenue shows up at 2%, but if you adjust it for the rugged mobile discontinuance, organic revenue would have been higher. FX was a 3% headwind in the quarter for medical. But overall, you can see revenue grew at 13% even with those issues. And operating profit was up 18% and operating margin, that's not EBITDA, operating margin was 36.6%. 
We had very strong performance out of Managed Health Care Associates. They continue to gain share. Of course, they have their favorable market conditions as aging continues in the population, but just terrific results. 
Double-digit growth in our medical device businesses: Verathon was very strong; Northern Digital, very strong; and our CIVCO, multi-modality business was very strong. 
Sunquest recurring revenue growth was, as expected, it was quite good, but we did have lower license and service sales in the quarter because of the Meaningful Use sort of take through to Python that occurred in 2014, so sort of a hopeless comp. But that will change pretty quickly as you'll see. 
Q1 acquisitions, all at 3 of them, the Strata business, the SoftWriters business and Data Innovations performed very well. In fact, sort of the 3 together were above expectations. And I mentioned that we exited this rugged mobile product line finally. 
In the second half of the year, you can see that we expect MHA to continue to benefit from the market conditions and their ability to execute against that. We see additional medical products out of Verathon, as they launch several things in Europe that are new to the continent, and Northern Digital expands in its sphere business. 
The scientific imaging businesses is basically flat. Sometimes, they look worse than they are because they've had that rugged mobile business in it for quite a long time. And for that gone, that gives us a little better headway for variable performance in the future. We think we'll get mid-single-digit organic growth out of the segment, but, of course, much higher total revenue growth. And then Sunquest has got a very nice opportunity that mostly benefits us in 2016, but a lot of software module upgrades now that the Meaningful Use processes subside with the hospitals. The same people that were involved in those, both at the hospital and that our level, are able to look at enhanced growth as they do product upgrades, software upgrades for various applications within the hospital. 
Next slide. Here we get to the guidance nature of what we think for the balance of the year. 
Next slide. For the full year, we were at -- we're establishing guidance at $6.61 to $6.75, or midpoint would be $6.68. Previously, we were at $6.75 to $6.95 with a midpoint of $6.85. And we really decided to take that down because with -- we thought we'd have organic growth of at least 3%, but it looks to us like it's more like 1% to 2% because of the depth of how much the oil and gas upstream markets really come down. We said at the beginning, the upstream was about 5% of the business last year and about 14% for oil and gas in total. Now oil and gas is down to 12%, as you might expect as the rest of the business is growing. And the upstream portion will continue to climb as a function of total revenue. 
We'll get mid-single-digit growth out of medical and RF organically, but we'll get additional revenue because of the acquisitions we already have and others that are possibly going to occur. In oil and gas, we think that's going to continue to be weak. We think it's going to look much like the second quarter. So we don't see much of a recovery in any of those end markets. 
Our tax rate for the year, we said at the beginning of the year, we thought it would be about 30.5%. We still think it will be about 30.5%. The discrete item that we had in the second quarter around state sales tax was something we expected to have and it was in our guidance for the full year, but it did move forward into the second quarter. 
Full year operating cash flow, we're saying should be around $925 million. In addition to our net earnings, we have about $160 million of noncash amortization. Our Q3 earnings, which should be just purely the net earnings with DEPS numbers, $1.53 to $1.57. 
Pressures for the year that we have to keep overcoming, that we've done, largely led by foreign exchange and then quite a bit from oil and gas. We have that Toronto headwind and then some modest changes in imaging and industrial. Had a pretty strong June compared to April and May, so we're a little bit encouraged in that respect. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the second quarter summary, once again, we have to really compliment our operating people, who acted very nimbly in terms of what was happening in the upstream oil and gas segment. They -- their ability to change variable cost is always just world-class. They had really terrific execution. And in the meantime, we wound up with record orders and revenue and net earnings and EBITDA for the quarter. And revenue certainly was hurt by the headwinds of FX, but notwithstanding that, we sort of powered through at a very favorable way: Acquisitions were up 4 and that offset the headwinds. And medical and RF were up so much, they offset the decline in industrial and energy, which was led by that oil and gas problem. 
Gross margins actually increased in the quarter, which is pretty amazing if you're starting out with 59.1%, and you can still improve gross margins in a quarter that's organically flat. That says a lot about the quality of the operating people we have in place. 
Our operating margins were up to 28.5% and EBITDA margins at 33.9%. Net earnings, we've covered before. Free cash flow, up 24% in the quarter. First acquisition that we've announced would have been in the quarter. It didn't get done till the 20th of July, was On Center. And we've got an active pipeline and we would expect to close some additional transactions before the end of the year. And in reflection, we just see the quarter as being very pleased, given the FX and selected end-market difficulty in terms of how we performed. 
So with that, I think we're ready to open it up for questions, John."

But just -- I think it's just so instructive about how good our business model is. If you go back and you look at how the segments were in the second quarter of '09 and compared the second quarter '09 to the second quarter of '08, and then you looked at the comparison of the second quarter of '15 to the second quarter of '14 to see kind of the rates have changed, you'd be astonished at how much better all these are. The thing that is amazing in the second quarter of '09, are Industrial Tech business, which is largely Neptune and flow control. It had $32.5 million of operating profit on a reported basis, and that was on a $136 million of revenue. So it's margin. It was 23.8% in OP at a time that people were concerned the world was ending. This time, this reduction, our OP in industrial is $52.2 million, not $32.5 million, and our revenue is $186 million, not $136 million. So we have now OP margins of 28% in industrial in the quarter versus 23.8% in the second quarter of '09. And it's nothing like the second quarter of '09 in terms of the rate of de-escalation. Second quarter of '09 over '08, our sales in the flow control segment were down 25.5%. OP was down 31.7%. There wasn't a lot of currency issues either. This time, our revenue was down 9%, not 25%. And our OP was down 13%, not 32%. And if you look at the energy segment, the energy segment in the second quarter of '09 had $23 million of OP on $105 million in revenues, so it had OP margins of 22%. This time, it's got $37.7 million in OP on $145 million in revenue. So the margins are 26%, up 400 basis points from the second quarter of '09. The sales trend in '09 versus '08 was down 27%. This time, it's 12.5% of that's FX. And OP was down 35%. This time, it's down 15%. So entirely different. And then it's always, for us, painful because people ask these reader-cost questions about these 2 businesses, which represent less than 30% of our EBITDA. Roper -- let's go to medical. Medical in the second quarter of '09, we had $12.4 million of OP on $76 million of revenue, 16.3%. This quarter, medical had $109 million in OP, 8x -- 9x the number on $302 million in revenue. And it wasn't down. It was up 12% on sales and it was up 16% on OP. Our margin in medical was 36.1% versus last year's second quarter of 16.3%. Our challenge is simply to continue to grow these things as well as we can. In our RF segment, in 2009, the second quarter had $39 million of OP on $187 million in revenue, so our margin profile was 21.1%. Today, RF had $79.9 million, double OP, and it had 255.6% in revenue. So sales were up 4%, and they're really up more than organically. And the OP was up dramatically. So you're looking at margins of 31.3% versus 21.1%. In total, Roper in the second quarter, when people thought the business was ending, had $96 million of OP on $505 million in revenue, 19%. This quarter, had $252 million in OP on $890 million in revenue, 28.3%. So we're up 930 basis points quarter-over-quarter in the as-reported GAAP OP number. So -- yes, there's a sharp reduction. Yes, we got rid of 150 people. Yes, the investment in that restructuring will turn cash positive in the fourth quarter. And no, we're not really worried about it."

And we've done it so much for so long, it's just a cultural kind of thing. Nobody would hide stuff here.

If you'll turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, including Data Innovations, SHP, SoftWriters, FoodLink and Strata for about $2.5 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisitions, those businesses would have recognized.

We'll start off going through our second quarter enterprise [ph] financial results and then look at the detailed activity within the 4 segments and the outlook for the rest of 2015, and then take questions and answers from the audience.",3571,"Thank you, John. We'll start off going through our second quarter enterprise [ph] financial results and then look at the detailed activity within the 4 segments and the outlook for the rest of 2015, and then take questions and answers from the audience. 
So next slide. As you can see here a summary of the second quarter. We achieved all-time second quarter records for orders, for revenue, for net earnings, for EBITDA, both nominally and a percentage basis, and cash flow, and margins were really quite outstanding. 
Revenue was up 1% to $892 million. Organic was flat, but the FX headwinds were 3% in the quarter. We had 13% growth in medical and 4% in RF, but we'll talk more about those 2 areas, sort of mid-single-digit organic growth going forward and then additional benefits from acquisitions. We had declines in industrial at 9% and energy in [ph] 12%. A lot of that is foreign exchange, as you'll see. But our oil and gas arena was down a little over 20% in the second quarter, which was about on par, a little bit worse than we had an expected. And we don't really see any improvement in that. For the balance of the year, it might get slightly worse. 
Gross margins, despite the end-market headwinds, were up 100 basis points and reached 60.1%. Our operating margins were up 60 basis points to hit 28.5%, which is truly outstanding margin improvement in this environment. Net earnings were up 10% to $173 million and DEPS represented $1.70. And of course, we cover, as always, about $40 million of noncash amortization in there. Free cash flow was up 24% to $162 million, so these really are record results despite the foreign exchange headwind and the end market difficulty. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the quarter 2 income statement. You can see book-to-bill was 0.99 in without -- in each of the segments, it was sort of 1.01 to 0.98 or something, so orders were quite consistent with revenue. Revenue was, as we said, affected by 3% on FX there, but up 1% overall. Gross profit, up 100 basis points; operating margin, 60%. You can see an effect, a benefit we had that we had planned throughout the year on a state tax matter, which has been resolved as we expected. We thought it might have occurred at a later point in time, but it's impossible to know when it hit this quarter. So it lowered our tax rate from the 30.4% of last year to 25.7% this year and that certainly helped the net earnings being up 10%. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the continuing compounding nature of how we grow cash flow. So in the second quarter, our operating cash flow was $173 million, which was a 23% increase over last year's second quarter results. Our free cash flow was $162 million, a 24% increase over last year. And for the first half of the year now, we've delivered $412 million in free cash flow, which represents a little over 23% of revenue and gives us a cash conversion ratio of 126%. 
And when you think about the compounding nature of us being able to reinvest our cash in transactions that give us still more cash, you can look at 2013 in the first half, we had $311 million. And just in the 2-year period, we're up 39% in half 1 to $433 million. So we still think the cash measurement is far and away the most important thing for people to look at when you're looking at the quality of the company's performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues to improve. Our working capital as a function of our second quarter annualized net sales is down to 4%. 2 years ago, that number was 7.5% and people would consistently ask us how you could possibly keep it at 7.5%, and we chose not to. We got it better. First, we cut it in half. So very nice reductions in the inventory from 6.3% of revenue 2 years ago to 5.5% now. And that's at a time when there was some considerable destocking in the oil and gas arena, which certainly didn't help us with the inventories. 
In receivables, they've dropped from 19.7% to 16.6%. And at the beginning of the quarter, given the difficulties, a lot of energy went into reinforcing our discipline processes [indiscernible] receivables. Because as you know, in periods like this, you can have some sloppy activity around getting paid. And then if we take our inventory at 5.5% and receivables at 16.6% and we subtract the payables of 18.1%, you can see our total net working capital there is 4%. 
Next slide. If we look at the overall financial position of the company, our cash increased from a year ago at $679 million versus $565 million. Our undrawn revolver and the cash together give us almost $1.9 billion in powder. The reality is we can easily increase that because of our debt ratio. As you can see, our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to $1.232 billion and while our gross debt-to-EBITDA is 2, our net debt-to-EBITDA is only 1.5. 
We have deployed $1 billion in acquisitions in the last 12 months, and we have a very active pipeline now. We did announce one acquisition we'll talk about when we get to the RF segment, but there are others that we're far along and working on. 
Next slide. Here, we'll discuss the individual nature of our segments. 
So the next slide. If we look at the 4 segments here, you can see the second quarter revenue in the blue chart and the green chart being the second quarter EBITDA. And so now you have really RF and medical representing a little over 70% of the total EBITDA that Roper is generating, and they do that at very high EBITDA margins. 
Our energy EBITDA and Industrial Tech, if you put the 2 together, it's $100 million of EBITDA and $331 million in revenue. So even in a more difficult end market with FX pressures, we created EBITDA margins in the second quarter of 30%. The nice thing about the 70% EBITDA from RF and Medical is those businesses are continuing to grow at mid-single digits organically, and they give us higher leverage on the next dollar of revenue than our energy and industrial businesses do. 
Next slide. If we look specifically at energy systems. It was down 12% on revenue versus last year's second quarter, but 5 points of that was due to foreign exchange and 7 points on organic. 
Deleveraging here was very well managed. You see the operating profit margin in the quarter was 26%. Gross margins remained above 55%, and we delevered at only about a 34% ratio. So once again, they've been able to take their variable cost structure and immediately adjust it. 
The oil and gas markets were weaker than we expected, particularly in those areas directly related to fracking. Our DESV business, the diesel engine shut-off valve business, was down 50%. And when we get to industrial, you'll see Roper Pump had some difficult things as well. The other markets, some of which are industrial that we report in energy, all were satisfactory, generally flat, a little bit of improvement in one place or another. 
The business executed terrifically well in the segment in the quarter. They took some additional cost actions, about $1 million in restructuring, which is included in our results. We're not excluding it. This demonstrates the benefit of having very few fixed assets, so we never have to work around absorption issues like others do and we get a very quick payback on variable cost takeouts. We've cut about 150 employees in our oil and gas space between energy and a little bit in Roper and Cornell Pump. 
For the second half of the year, we don't really see any kind of forecast improvement in oil and gas markets. There's kind of a mixed bag. If you listen to various people, I guess, if we were going to say would it get better or worse, we'd be planning that they're getting worse and not better. But we expect them to be pretty much the way they were in the second quarter. We expect to get some modest growth in other served markets that these businesses have that are not in the oil and gas arena. And we think that the FX headwinds are unfortunately going to continue to persist, much as they did in the second quarter. We think we'll have sort of high single-digit organic decline for the rest of the year, but then it gives us really easy comps for 2016. 
Next slide. If we look at industrial. Industrial continues to perform incredibly on a margin basis. Their gross margins in the quarter were over 50%. Our operating margins were over 28%. They were down 9% on revenue, but 5% of that is foreign exchange. And all of the rest of it is virtually the fact that our Toronto project in Canada with Neptune is winding down, and they did very little in the second quarter. In fact, it was down $8 million in the second quarter versus last year. So the rest of the business actually performed fine. It would have been flat to modestly up. 
Our oil and gas markets, again, were weaker than expected. Roper Pump saw some destocking activity in their surface pumps. Their revenue was down close to 80%, but their reline business was up twice as much as it had been the year before. So those products continue to be consumed in the ongoing activity of that technology that we've introduced. Rental market for flow control as it relates to the upstream oil and gas was, of course, not good at all. 
Our material analysis business, Struers, had a -- just a very, very fine quarter. They were up more than double digits organic growth. On a constant-currency basis, it was up incredibly and still up more than 10% even adjusted for currency. 
As the Neptune project sort of -- it appears to us as virtually complete. We're only being asked to do odds and ends now, so that was a negative headwind of $8 million in the quarter. The rest of Neptune, fortunately, was continuing to grow and it looks to us like it must be continuing to gain share. 
In the second half of the year, we don't really see any improvements, as we've said, around oil and gas markets. I don't think they get worse here. Likely, they get a little bit of favorable increase. Roper Pump was a little slower than the rest of our businesses to react, so we've now cut about 40 people in flow control where the end markets have required that. So we think we'll get a little bit better deleverage performance out of them in the second half of the year than we got in the second quarter. Our material analysis business, there's no signs of it weakening in any way. It's continuing to do really very well. 
Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S. market. The Toronto project headwind in the second half for us is going to be about $20 million. It's about $30 million for the full year, and that's the thing that happens with these kind of projects. There aren't those big ones that happen very often and they're working on a few. But the core U.S. business will have positive growth this year. So we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic decline for the segment. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the RF business, you'll see we had revenue of $256 million, which represented organic growth of 6%. Actually, the organic growth would have been a little bit better. You can see in that top line, FX is down 1% and divestiture is 1%. You might remember in the first quarter, we sold our Black Diamond rugged mobile business and that was a little over a $4 million drag on revenue in the second quarter for us. 
We had terrific results in our toll and traffic business and growth continues to expand. We've got multiple projects for upgrades that are in quotation now. We've probably really never had a better forward-looking opportunity than we do today with toll and traffic. 
The Riyadh traffic project started up in the second quarter and already has resulted in several change orders and extensions that we think will benefit us, particularly in '16 and perhaps yet this year. We had double-digit growth in our tag sales for tolling. The software subscriber additions continued to grow nicely in our freight matching business. We have 3 of those, 1 in the east, 1 in the west and 1 in Canada. 
The strength in our RF product line businesses were -- was excellent, particularly pendants for senior care; sub-metering for apartment, multifamily housing; and the U.K. water application business, Technolog, did well as a result as well. 
For the second half, we still have that little Black Diamond headwind in the second half. It will be several million dollars. It doesn't repeat. But on the other hand, it didn't contribute any positive income, so it doesn't have any effect on that. 
We've got backlog in proposal activity in toll and traffic, as I said, sort of at an all-time high with lots of long-term opportunities there. We don't see any pullback in our subscriber growth in our software businesses, whether they're licensed or SaaS. And we acquired On Center Software, which is in The Woodlands in Houston, Texas. A very nice business, well managed by Cecilia Padilla. It's a really, again, a business that has higher EBITDA margins than Roper's base business. It's been growing at very solid double-digit revenue, but we actually think it's been underinvested in to support even faster growth. And that business only just closed on Monday, so we're just getting started talking with them about how to enhance their growth profile. 
We think we'll get mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment in RF. But total revenue, including acquisitions would be a little better. 
Next slide. Here if we look at medical solutions, you can see once again, you got a little story about us pruning businesses. We got rid -- we really exited our rugged mobile product line. That's in addition to the Black Diamond rugged mobile business, which was a little military app. This was a $5 million drag in the second quarter, and it's another $7 million drag for the balance of the year. It's the right thing to do. This is the time to do it. It wasn't contributing any income. The technology portion that we want, we've embedded inside our Amtech business, so that's really important for us. Organic revenue shows up at 2%, but if you adjust it for the rugged mobile discontinuance, organic revenue would have been higher. FX was a 3% headwind in the quarter for medical. But overall, you can see revenue grew at 13% even with those issues. And operating profit was up 18% and operating margin, that's not EBITDA, operating margin was 36.6%. 
We had very strong performance out of Managed Health Care Associates. They continue to gain share. Of course, they have very favorable market conditions as aging continues in the population, but just terrific results. 
Double-digit growth in our medical device businesses: Verathon was very strong; Northern Digital, very strong; and our CIVCO, multi-modality business was very strong. 
Sunquest recurring revenue growth was, as expected, it was quite good, but we did have lower license and service sales in the quarter because of the Meaningful Use, sort of pig through the Python, that occurred in 2014, so sort of a hopeless comp. But that will change pretty quickly as you'll see. 
Q1 acquisitions, all 3 of them, the Strata business, the SoftWriters business and Data Innovations performed very well. In fact, sort of the 3 together were above expectations. And I mentioned that we exited this rugged mobile product line finally. 
In the second half of the year, you can see that we expect MHA to continue to benefit from the market conditions and their ability to execute against that. We see additional medical products out of Verathon, as they launch several things in Europe that are new to the continent, and Northern Digital expands in its sphere business. 
The scientific imaging business is basically flat. Sometimes they look worse than they are because they've had that rugged mobile business in it for quite a long time. And with that gone, that gives us a little better headway for variable performance in the future. We think we'll get mid-single-digit organic growth out of the segment, but, of course, much higher total revenue growth. And then Sunquest has got a very nice opportunity that mostly benefits us in 2016, but a lot of software module upgrades now that the Meaningful Use processes subside with the hospitals. The same people that were involved in those, both at the hospital and that our level, are able to look at enhanced growth as they do product upgrades, software upgrades for various applications within the hospital. 
Next slide. Here we get to the guidance nature of what we think for the balance of the year. 
Next slide. For the full year, we were at -- we're establishing guidance at $6.61 to $6.75, or midpoint would be $6.68. Previously, we were at $6.75 to $6.95 with a midpoint of $6.85. And we've really decided to take that down because we -- we thought we'd have organic growth of at least 3%, but it looks to us like it's more like 1% to 2% because of the depth of how much the oil and gas upstream markets really come down. We said at the beginning, the upstream was about 5% of the business last year and about 14% for oil and gas in total. Now oil and gas is down to 12%, as you might expect as the rest of the business is growing. And the upstream portion will continue to decline as a function of total revenue. 
We'll get mid-single-digit growth out of medical and RF organically, but we'll get additional revenue because of the acquisitions that we already have and others that are possibly going to occur. In oil and gas, we think that's going to continue to be weak. We think it's going to look much like the second quarter. So we don't see much of a recovery in any of those end markets. 
Our tax rate for the year, we said at the beginning of the year, we thought it would be about 30.5%. We still think it will be about 30.5%. The discrete item that we had in the second quarter around state sales tax was something we expected to have and it was in our guidance for the full year, but it did move forward into the second quarter. 
Full year operating cash flow, we're saying should be around $925 million. In addition to our net earnings, we have about $160 million of noncash amortization. Our Q3 earnings, which would be just purely the net earnings with DEPS numbers, $1.53 to $1.57. 
Pressures for the year that we have to keep overcoming, that we've done, largely led by foreign exchange and then quite a bit from oil and gas. We have that Toronto headwind and then some modest changes in imaging and industrial. Had a pretty strong June compared to April and May, so we're a little bit encouraged in that respect. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the second quarter summary, once again, we have to really compliment our operating people, who acted very nimbly in terms of what was happening in the upstream oil and gas segment. They -- their ability to change variable cost is always just world-class. They had really terrific execution. And in the meantime, we wound up with record orders and revenue and net earnings and EBITDA for the quarter. And revenue certainly was hurt by the headwinds of FX, but notwithstanding that, we sort of powered through in a very favorable way. Acquisitions were up 4 and that offset the headwinds. And medical and RF were up so much, they offset the decline in industrial and energy, which was led by that oil and gas problem. 
Gross margins actually increased in the quarter, which is pretty amazing if you're starting out at 59.1%, and you can still improve gross margins in a quarter that's organically flat. That says a lot about the quality of the operating people we have in place. 
Our operating margins were up to 28.5% and the EBITDA margin is at 33.9%. Net earnings, we've covered before. Free cash flow, up 24% in the quarter. The first acquisition that we've announced that would have been in the quarter. It didn't get done till the 20th of July, was On Center. And we've got an active pipeline and we would expect to close some additional transactions before the end of the year. And in reflection, we just see the quarter as being very pleased, given the FX and selected end-market difficulty in terms of how we performed. 
So with that, I think we're ready to open it up for questions, John."

But just -- because I think it's just so instructive about how good our business model is. If you go back and you look at how the segments were in the second quarter of '09 and compare the second quarter '09 to the second quarter of '08, and then you looked at the comparison of the second quarter of '15 to the second quarter of '14 to see kind of the rates of change, you'd be astonished at how much better all these are. The thing that is amazing, in the second quarter of '09, our Industrial Tech business, which is largely Neptune and Flow Control. It had $32.5 million of operating profit on a reported basis, and that was on a $136 million of revenue. So it's margin. It was 23.8% in OP at a time that people were concerned the world was ending. This time, this reduction, our OP in industrial is $52.2 million, not $32.5 million, and our revenue is $186 million, not $136 million. So we have now OP margins of 28% in industrial in the quarter versus 23.8% in the second quarter of '09. And it's nothing like the second quarter of '09 in terms of the rate of de-escalation. Second quarter of '09 over '08, our sales in the Flow Control segment were down 25.5%. OP was down 31.7%. There wasn't a lot of currency issues either. This time, our revenue is down 9%, not 25%. And our OP was down 13%, not 32%. And if you look at the energy segment, the energy segment in the second quarter of '09 had $23 million of OP on $105 million in revenues, so it had OP margins of 22%. This time, it's got $37.7 million in OP on $145 million in revenue. So the margins are 26%, up 400 basis points from the second quarter of '09. The sales trend in '09 versus '08 was down 27%. This time, it's 12% and 1/2 of that's FX. And OP was down 35%. This time, it's down 15%. So entirely different. And then it's always, for us, painful because people ask these [indiscernible] cost questions about these 2 businesses, which represent less than 30% of our EBITDA. Roper -- let's go to medical. Medical in the second quarter of '09, we had $12.4 million of OP on $76 million of revenue, 16.3%. This quarter, medical had $109 million in OP, 8x -- 9x the number on $302 million in revenue. And it wasn't down. It was up 12% on sales and it was up 16% on OP. Our margin in medical was 36.1% versus last year's second quarter of 16.3%. Our challenge is simply to continue to grow these things as well as we can. In our RF segment, in 2009, the second quarter had $39 million of OP on $187 million in revenue, so our margin profile was 21.1%. Today, RF had $79.9 million, double OP, and it had 255.6% in revenue. So sales were up 4%, and they're really up more than organically. And the OP was up dramatically. So you're looking at margins of 31.3% versus 21.1%. In total, Roper in the second quarter, when people thought the business was ending, had $96 million of OP on $505 million in revenue, 19%. This quarter, had $252 million in OP on $890 million in revenue, 28.3%. So we're up 930 basis points quarter-over-quarter in the as-reported GAAP OP number. So -- yes, there's a sharp reduction. Yes, we got rid of 150 people. Yes, the investment in that restructuring will turn cash positive in the fourth quarter. And no, we're not really worried about it."

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.ropertech.com. 
So if you please turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of purchase accounting adjustments one to divert to acquire deferred revenue in our recent software acquisitions. That totals $2.2 million. 
In addition, we have an inventory step up expense for RF IDeas of $2 million. 
As a reminder, these adjustments represent adjustments that absent our acquisition, those businesses would have been able to show their profitability and revenue. 
Now if you'll please turn the slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?"

So we start here with our Q3 enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought was significant given the sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actua",3817,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. 
So we start here with our Q3 enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought was significant given the sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actually was modestly up from last year at $886 million and our book-to-bill was $101 million and above one most everywhere, with the exception of RF which is, of course, project driven. 
Growth was led by medical, which was up 12%. Revenue and RF Technology, which was up 6% revenue. The declines that we saw in the Industrial and Energy were adversely exactly as we have modeled. 
FX was about a 3% headwind in the quarter and resulted to a bit of negative organic issues. It seems about 2 of those Industrial and Energy headwinds. 
Gross margin were particular. They were up 130 basis points to 60.7% over last year and even up sequentially from the second quarter. 
EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points to 34.4%, both records. Net earnings were up 4% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus our guidance of $1.53 to $1.57. 
Our free cash flow was $220 million, which was up sharply from the second quarter, $162 million and $220 million of free cash flow represents 137% conversion. 
We deployed $435 million in 3 acquisitions, RF IDeas, Atlantic Health partners and On Center, which we have discussed earlier. 
And we just completed the Aderant acquisition on Wednesday, which was a $675 million net of tax benefit acquisition, we'll talk more about this morning. And today, we're announcing 2 more transactions CliniSys Group and Athys medical. So it was really an outstanding quarter and of course, great capital deployment for us. 
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, we're sort of lapping because if the old story about the ducks on the pond and they're moving along nicely but underneath, their feet are moving wildly. Lots of activity, but at the end of the day, we're up $1 million. But you got to know that, that's in the face of oil and gas being down about 3% of our entire revenue and FX about 3% and of course, the City of Toronto roll up, another one, so we had to overcome quite a bit of headwinds and still produce positive results. 
Our gross margin was up from 59.4% a year ago to 60.7%, and it really demonstrates the quality of our businesses because even in this difficult markets, they not only are holding our gross margins, but oftentimes, increasing them. 
If you look at the operating margin it, too, shows an incredible execution, 27.9% a year ago and 28.7% this year, up 80 basis points despite having quite a bit of M&A expenses that we took in during the quarter for all this activity. 
You can see that tax rate was 30.4%, which was a little bit lower than last year's 31.3%. But I'll remind you, our second quarter, it was only 25.7% so it was a $0.12 had been relative to Q2 on the tax rate and the tax rate gave us about $0.02 favorable in the quarter.  And then you can see the DEPS at $1.61. 
Next slide. The compounding of cash flow, if there's any theme around here, it would be that we are a base compounder. 
You can see our cash flow, our operating cash flow has gone up from $579 million during the first 3 quarters of last year to $660 million now. The operating cash flow conversion was 141%. Our free cash flow conversion was 137%, and what we always ask people to look at even though we don't report on a cash earnings per-share basis, if you take a look here at our revenue, free cash flow, you'll see that 25% of our revenue turned into free cash flow in the quarter. 
Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 15% over last year at $632 million, and we still do think cash is the best measure of performance. 
Next slide. We continue to look at the balance sheet and our asset velocity, you'll see that we've improved another 160 basis points from the third quarter of '14 to the third quarter of this year. Everything is better, inventory is down, receivables are down, payables are up, and so the net effect is we go from 5.8% at the end of the third quarter last year to 4.2% now and our governance process just continues to drive the working capital focus for everyone here throughout the unity. 
Next slide. We look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with very strong balance sheet. We had $700 million in cash. a lot of that's outside the U.S., of course, an undrawn revolver given us sort of cash and undraw of revolver capacity of about $1.6 billion and our gross net number, you can see there is at about $2.8 billion. 
Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is about $1.239 billion, that's not pro forma, that's just the actual number. Pro forma would be higher, of course, with our acquisitions. Given us a gross debt-to-EBITDA profile of about 2.3. 
Our pipeline opportunities are still really quite good, so we're going to continue to see acquisitions flowing here in 2016. 
We're rapidly getting to the point where we're going to billion dollars of cash flow very soon on an annual basis. And of course, we tend to reinvest that at about 1.3 to 1.5x that cash flow so we look at forward at $1.5 billion of so of investment opportunity next year. 
The Aderant transaction, of course, is going to be around $695 million in terms of -- the cash cost to that, so that will take up the rest of our revolver. And as a result, we've upside the revolver from $1.5 billion to $1.850 billion. 
And the CliniSys transaction will be the -- basically funded out of non-U.S. cash so there's no new borrowing required, so it gives us a very strong balance sheet. 
Next slide. Here, we just have a place order before we start talking about our segment deal and the outlook. 
Next slide. If you look at the performance of all 4 of the segments, they continue to be just marvelous. Here you are with these headwinds, currency challenges and everything else in energy and yet our EBITDA margins in the quarter were 33%. 
Our Industrial Technology, which is only about 10%, affected by oil and gas bill had 31% EBITDA margins, while RF had 36% and Medical, 45%.  So all of these segments have just incredible margins.  And if you think about it from a historical perspective, going back to look just at 2011, not very long ago, our collected EBITDA is up about 580 basis points since the third quarter of 2011. And also you want to remember when we report EBITDA, almost all of our D&A is really just noncash amortization. And then like depreciation, that noncash amortization has no call on future capital spending. 
Also, you can see Medical and RF are still over 2/3 of our total EBITDA. 
Next slide. So we look at the smallest segment, Energy Systems & Controls. We went into the year saying that will be about 60% of that segment would be in oil and gas, and that's actually going to be slightly less than that, just due to the sales. But notwithstanding that, we had a lot of FX exposure, of course, in Energy with a lot of non-U.S. activity, so FX was a negative 5% headwind in the quarter. The oil and gas markets were about as weak as we expected, in fact, when we look back about how it performed versus how we modeled them, there was literally no variance. 
The other served markets were flat with a few modest exceptions that were up. We had really terrific margin performance as everybody executed very nimbly, terrific deleverage performance. And the operating margin is actually up 60 basis points from a year ago, and I think notably, it's up 330 basis points from what we reported in the second quarter. So we've gone from 26% OP margin to 29.3% sequentially on effectively the same revenue. So that's quite an accomplishment. I think everybody in the segment, to most part, deserves a lot of credit for them. 
When we look at it's trending into Q4, what we would see is sort of the same level of weakness, but some incremental improvement just because of some seasonal programs that tend to occur inside energy. But with energy being less than 1 in every $7 of revenue, it won't have a big effect for us. 
We had strong growth in our nuclear test business on improving market conditions. There is a good deal of activity that's emerging both in China and Korea-based opportunity in the Middle East and start-ups, again, in Japan for the nuclear activity, so that's going to be a material improvement for us in the fourth quarter and into 2016. 
The cost actions that we took earlier this year, you can see, have already improved our margins here in the third quarter, and we expect the margins to improve still a bit more into the fourth quarter of this year. 
Next slide. The Industrial Technology segment, which is about 10% of oil and gas by the way, a little less in this quarter, it had a 4% hit on FX. We also have, in the Industrial Technology segment, the City of Toronto rolloff from Neptune, which we said this year would be in the neighborhood of $40 million or about $8 million to $9 million a quarter, and that's about what it was in this quarter, so that's most of the organic issue. 
Neptune, on the other hand, grew mid-single digits, excluding the completion of Toronto projects, but we were pleased with that. Our oil and gas markets were almost exactly as we expected them in here, but the margins remain really strong when you think about the challenges these folks had. They could have done a little better job on deleveraging, and we've talked to them about that and I think we'll see better performance in that respect in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to have growth in our material analysis businesses, and they are holding up very well given their European and Asian exposure. 
In the fourth quarter, we already announced as of October 2 that we completed the divestiture of ABEL Pumps. That was a business that we sold for EUR 95 million. It has very strong fourth quarter, so the buyer will be benefited by that. We had it projected in our guidance at about $14 million of revenue and about $0.03 a share of earnings, which of course now goes away. 
On the other hand, we get EUR 95 million and have already effectively reinvested that money in the acquisitions we've just made in higher-margin businesses that don't require the assets that ABEL was going to require to sustain its growth. 
Oil and gas is the week, but growth in the other markets is pretty good and is offsetting, for the most part, the oil and gas weakness. 
We do think in the fourth quarter, we'll have better margins, with better leverage performance. 
Next slide. We look here at RF Technology. We were up, as you can see, 6% revenue and up 10% in operating profit. If you look at that operating margin at 3-point -- 30.3%, up 120 basis points, want to remind us that the EBITDA margin in this segment is 35.7%, so we have a lot of noncash amortization and the 35.7 number demonstrates just how powerful the cash earnings profile of the RF Technology segment is. 
Organic revenue was up, for FX was a 1% headwind. The growth continued in our infinitive blade systems, both in Florida and Texas, and we have a number of quotations out so that looks very favorable as we go into next year. 
We had quite reasonable subscriber additions in our various freight matching businesses that supported growth in the quarter. 
And then we acquired RF IDeas in September, and that business has historically grown at double digits, and we certainly expect that, that will be the case in the future, both Rick and Greg, who are driving that business, have been there a long time, they have created unbelievable value-added reseller network and terrific connectivity with OEMs, primarily the business provides proprietary card reading technology, so you can think of it doing for the individual what Neptune reader technology does for a big collective entity. Lots of identification and authenticity idea that they have a lot of bit of a single sign-on things like printers. They are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications and thousands of customers. It's quite a decent balance sheet. As you might imagine as our deals are. 
If we look to the fourth quarter, the software business as we think will continue to grow at mid-single digits. We'll get great leverage out of them and terrific cash flow performance. 
The backlog and proposal activity that we have at toll and traffic is pretty good. We don't see any slowing in that arena. We'll finally give them with a couple of projects, which have been things that have been challenging to say the least that will be behind us. That's really good news. And then we'll have very strong segment margin performance, we think, continuing, led by our SaaS and application software businesses. 
Last Wednesday, we completed the acquisition of Aderant. Aderant is really an incredible company. If we turn to slide here, we can look at the detailed explanation of Aderant. It's just in a sense, it's just a great business. It has lots of complimentary notes that have come to us from various admirers of Aderant and Chris team. I think we've never had as many unsolicited inbound notes about what the great businesses, thanks, goodness it's finally in the home of a public company that will continue to invest in it. There's been an amount of fear, may be unwarranted, but for us very real from law firms, who I'm sure, would it shock you that they tend to be somewhat conservative who were not too happy to see Aderant in the hands of a private equity previously. And it always makes people worry about whether they can depend on continued internal development and growth. Aderant has really end-to-end platform of mission-critical software that primarily goes to law firms now but could be expanded to other professional services organizations. 
It adds 3,000 of the world's largest law firm and professional services organizations, and they really do a full suite of activity all the way from time capturing and building to docketing. They're in Atlanta, they got a great software business also in Auckland, New Zealand, which we're very encouraged by. 
We think they're going to generate over $125 million of revenue in 2016 and beyond. And of course, it is, as always, a high-margin business. 
If you look at our acquisition criteria on the right, you'll see it's got an excellent management team. In fact, we're retaining everyone so that's a check the box. High revenue, yes, we can check that box, over 95% customer retention. Strong cash flow characteristics, asset light, well yes, once again negative working capital so people pay us in advance for work that we're going to eventually perform. Very deep domain experience inside in terms of people who are accustomed and used to working with law firms and what their needs really are. And it has multiple growth opportunities, including opportunities to do additional acquisitions at the Aderant, which is one of the things that we've been so encouraged by these last 3 larger transactions in the form of Sunquest, which you see us doing, continual bolt-ons too and MHA, which we continue to do and now Aderant, which is the third largest acquisitions that we've made, we'll have a very strong forward opportunity to continue to add businesses to this very, very good platform.  It's another great niche software business for us. 
Next slide. We look at medical solutions, and it will have really dropped a reference to Scientific Imaging. I mean, the reality is that it's no longer vary material. In the quarter, the Scientific Imaging business had about a 6% decline, all of which really was our rugged mobile business, which would have been just gradually winding down. As you recall, we sold the Black Diamond business that was reported in RF, but it had both dap and this thing should be pretty well cycled through before the end of the year. If it weren't for that medical would have -- I'm sorry, Scientific Imaging would have been flat in the quarter. 
You can see that the Medical businesses grew organically by about 5%, while total revenue was up 12% because of the acquisition content. FX in the segment was 3% headwind. 
We had continued growth at MHA with significant customer acquisitions and Mike Sicilian and his team were able to acquire Atlantic Healthcare Partners, which is really a vaccine GPO, but it gives us a new channel Director physician offices. It will contribute meaningfully to our EBITDA in 2016 and is a terrific acquisition, and so congratulations to Mike and Jason Connely and others there. 
Our record revenue increased at the Sunquest, which was good sign. We really do believe Sunquest is going to be positioned for a strong 2016 and everything that we've seen as we continue to do these acquisitions, we'll talk about in a second, so just so we're putting together quite impressive platform of opportunities over a long period of time at Sunquest. 
Our Medical Device businesses were quite strong, driven by new product introductions and the execution around introducing those at both Verathon and Northern Digital. Those certainly outperforming the rest of our medical product businesses. 
Our recent acquisitions that we've done this year, all of which are performing above our internal plans for how they would do. 
We signed an agreement, just sort of virtually within the last couple of days, to acquire CliniSys Group U.K. It's a leading provider of hospital laboratory software and so just think about it basically as being the Sunquest of Europe. It has a sort of an elongated customary merger control review process that will happen in the U.K. and Europe. We expect that we should be able to get that all closed out, and it ought to be inside our reporting entity by maybe the end of January or certainly, early in 2016. 
We invested $170 million -- I'm sorry, GBP 170 million in that business, but all CliniSys will be paid for from our non-U.S. cash. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll continue to have like mid-single digit organic growth in the Medical businesses, but we those gross margins will continue as incredible as they are today. And once again, if you look at the OP margin where we reported 36.6%, but remember that the EBITDA margin is 45%, so lots of non-cash detractors on the OP margin can confuse people about how great and powerful these businesses are on a cash earnings basis. 
We continue to have outstanding margin and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter. Our Atlas Medical acquisition, which literally we finished yesterday, will also expand our laboratory connectivity. This is really an amazing business. It's been developed by Founder, Rob Atlas, was extremely well known in the hospital arena. And Rob will be joining the Sunquest team. Atlas Medical, this business will really be a bolt-on for Sunquest, but it provides support mechanism to both Sunquest and Data Innovations. 
The connectivity solutions are basically thinking about the lab to the physician outreach that a hospital would have been and then within the hospital, the concept of lab-to-lab communication where oftentimes people can't see the data they want, that results in unnecessary additional tests. 
We like the whole concept, the coordinated diagnostics inside the hospital. We really believe that gives us a preeminent edge over what other people do in this category and over time, you'll hear us talk more about Sunquest and Atlas as a combination. 
Next slide. Here we'll look at the guidance for the year. 
Next slide. We updated our guidance, actually, raised the guidance for the full year to $6.69 to $6.75. Previously, it was $6.61 to $6.75, so this moves the midpoint up from $6.68 to $6.72, so it's a 4-point increase, $0.04 a share increase. 
But remember, this is despite ABEL leaving and ABEL will cost us $0.03, maybe $0.04 during this.  So if we have not ABEL, we would have raised the high-end a little more, but we have to absorb that offset. 
And again, when you look at the cash conversion, third quarter was 137%, cash conversion for the year certainly should exceed 130%. So the DEPS number is one thing, but the cash performance is quite much more important. 
We also raised our operating cash flow target to between $925 million to $940 million for the full year, and that's another projected increase from what we suggested in the past and CapEx is not running very high this year, less than $40 million, so it's going to promote a lot of free cash flow. 
Next slide. So we go to the summary here for the third quarter. Really, a record quarter despite the headwinds, so not sure we could expect to do as well as we did. We're quite pleased with the performance. Book-to-bill at 1.01x is a good sign for the fourth quarter and gross margins with -- reaching 60.7%, and I went back to look at where we were in the third quarter in 2011 and we were at 53.7% gross margins, so we've added 700 basis points to our gross margins in the last 4 years here in the third quarter. Our operating margin is 28.7% and our EBITDA margin is 34.4%. And if you go back to the third quarter of 2011, you'll see EBITDA was about 28.6%, and now it's 34.4%. 
Our DEPS of $1.61 exceeded our guidance. Free cash flow, 25% of revenue and 137% conversion. 
Our full year DEPS raised and cash flow guidance raised. We deployed $435 million in 3 terrific acquisitions. And then just as we begin this quarter, we acquired Aderant, our third largest transaction in the history and yesterday, signed an agreement to acquire Atlas Medical. 
So we were able to confirm everything without that would happen in the fourth quarter and really believe we're very well positioned to have a record 2016, but we wont provide guidance around that until we report earnings in January. 
So with that, John, I think we're ready for opening up for questions."

So we don't want to go into some situations where people are going to write software of our software. We're really providing some kind of service to somebody we happen to be using softer to achieve the benefit of what it is. But you have to have the domain experience. So it in our guys at the core are software people, they're domain expertise softer who use software solutions for somebody that's efficient and effective for them. So as long as we continue to see things that that are in those spaces, we'll be able to make the acquisitions. A couple of sessions ago, I said, when we did Sunquest and we did MHA, they were really, really as important for the future of Roper Technologies as Neptune and TransCore were back in 2003 and '04 for Roper Industries. Sunquest and MHA gives us world-class leadership organization that allow us to bolt-on acquisitions and things that are complementary to them and most of what we've done this year has something to do with one or the other of those organizations. Aderant is similarly positioned to do that. It's a great organization. If you go back and look at first, he did a YouTube video on the day of the acquisition that was just brilliant. And you can see how he's expressing the fact that now being able being owned by public company, people in his customers can have the confidence that they'll get the continued investment for his program to continue to account the most important player in that area. So we're always kind of agnostic about what it is the business does. So we don't really have a boundary around the business as long as it hits the excellent magic team, high recurring revenue, great cash flow, prefer to have view of any assets and domain experience, then we're pretty wide open on where we would deploy our capital. Now, we also have some internal things we always want to be able to add value to the business and some meaningful way that we can understand. And we want to think that people working in our government system will perform better than they were when they did it, and we think of our intelligence process that either of those would happen, then we would have abandoned the deal."

The PP&E that used to generate ABEL Pumps, these are really large, they're more like closer, aggressive brand or something like that, are just totally at typically unique large test facilities mostly with this tests. A lot of their growth, which should be quite good will be in India related to power generation. And so the end markets that they serve, we're going to require additional capital deployment for us to continue to grow those businesses. And it wasn't deployed like we should invest. Therefore, we really felt that would be better if we cut this loose to somebody who is seeing this as growth platform, which can become. I think it's a good acquisition for the people that bought it and I think it will perform quite well for them. But we're able to get out of it at EUR 95 million and it would be hard-pressed to say sort of 12x trailing numbers is something which we should turn down."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.ropertech.com. 
So if you please turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation available on our website. 
For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of purchase accounting adjustments one to differ to acquire deferred revenue in our recent software acquisitions, that totals $2.2 million. 
In addition, we have an inventory step-up expense for RF IDeas of $2 million. 
As a reminder, these adjustments represent adjustments that absent our acquisition, those businesses would have been able to show their profitability and revenue. 
Now if you please turn the slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?"

So we start here with our Q3 Enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought was significant given the sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actua",3827,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. 
So we start here with our Q3 Enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought was significant given the sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actually was modestly up from last year at $886 million and our book-to-bill was 1.01x and above 1 most everywhere, with the exception of RF which is, of course, project-driven. 
Growth was led by Medical, which was up 12% in revenue and RF Technology, which was up 6% in revenue. The declines that we saw in the Industrial and Energy were virtually exactly as we had modeled. 
FX was about a 3% headwind in the quarter and that resulted in a bit of negative Organic as you can see there's about 2 of those Industrial and Energy headwinds. 
Gross margins were spectacular. They were up 130 basis points to 60.7% over last year and even up sequentially from the second quarter. 
EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points to 34.4%, both records. Net earnings were up 4% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus our guidance of $1.53 to $1.57. 
Our free cash flow was $220 million, which was up sharply from the second quarter, is $162 million, and the $220 million of free cash flow represents 137% conversion. 
We deployed $435 million in 3 acquisitions, RF IDeas, Atlantic Health partners and On Center, which we have discussed earlier. 
And we just completed the Aderant acquisition on Wednesday, which was a $675 million net of tax benefit acquisition, we'll talk more about this morning. And today, we're announcing 2 more transactions CliniSys Group and Atlas Medical. So it was really an outstanding quarter and of course, great capital deployment for us. 
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, we're sort of laughing because if the old story about the ducks on the pond and they're moving along nicely but underneath, their feet are moving wildly. Lots of activity, but at the end of the day, we're up $1 million. But you got to know that, that's in the face of oil and gas being down about 3% of our entire revenue and FX about 3% and of course, the city of Toronto roll up, another one, so we had to overcome quite a bit of headwinds and still produce positive results. 
Our gross margin was up from 59.4% a year ago to 60.7%, and it really demonstrates the quality of our businesses because even in these difficult markets, they not only are holding their gross margins, but oftentimes, increasing them. 
If you look at the operating margin it, too, shows an incredible execution, 27.9% a year ago and 28.7% this year, up 80 basis points despite having quite a bit of M&A expenses that we took in during the quarter for all this activity. 
You can see that tax rate was 30.4%, which was a little bit lower than last year's 31.3%. But I'll remind you, our second quarter, it was only 25.7% so there was a $0.12 headwind relative to Q2 on the tax rate and the tax rate gave us about $0.02 favorable in the quarter.  And then you can see the DEPS at $1.61. 
Next slide. The compounding of cash flow, if there's any theme around here, it would be that, that we are a base compounder. 
You can see our cash flow, our operating cash flow has gone up from $579 million during the first 3 quarters of last year to $660 million now. The operating cash flow conversion was 141%. Our free cash flow conversion was 137%, and what we always ask people to look at even though we don't report on a cash earnings per-share basis, if you take a look here at our revenue, free cash flow, you'll see that 25% of our revenue turned into free cash flow in the quarter. 
Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 15% over last year at $632 million, and we still do think cash is the best measure of performance. 
Next slide. We continue to look at the balance sheet and our asset velocity, you'll see that we've improved another 160 basis points from the third quarter of '14 to the third quarter of this year. Everything is better, inventory is down, receivables are down, payables are up, and so the net effect is we go from 5.8% at the end of the third quarter last year to 4.2% now and our governance process just continues to drive the working capital focus for everyone here throughout the unity. 
Next slide. We look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with very strong balance sheet. We had $700 million in cash, lot of that's outside the U.S., of course, an undrawn revolver given us sort of cash and undraw of revolver capacity of about $1.6 billion and our gross net number, you can see there is at about $2.8 billion. 
Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is about $1.239 billion, that's not pro forma, that's just the actual number. Pro forma would be higher, of course, with our acquisitions. Given us a gross debt-to-EBITDA profile of about 2.3. 
Our pipeline opportunities are still really quite good, so we're going to continue to see acquisitions flowing here in 2016. 
We're rapidly getting to the point where we're going to have billion dollars of cash flow very soon on an annual basis. And of course, we tend to reinvest that at about 1.3 to 1.5x that cash flow so we still look forward to another $1.5 billion or so of investment opportunity next year. 
The Aderant transaction, of course, is going to be around $695 million in terms of -- the cash cost to that, so that will take up the rest of our revolver. And as a result, we've upsized the revolver from its $1.5 billion to $1.850 billion. 
And the CliniSys transaction will be the -- basically funded out of non-U.S. cash so there's no new borrowing required, so it gives us a very strong balance sheet. 
Next slide. Here, we just have a placeholder before we start talking about our segment deal and the outlook. 
Next slide. If you look at the performance of all 4 of the segments, they continue to be just marvelous. Here you are with these headwinds, currency challenges and everything else in Energy and yet our EBITDA margins in the quarter were 33%. 
Our Industrial Technology, which is only about 10%, affected by oil and gas still had 31% EBITDA margins, while RF had 36% and Medical, 45%.  So all of these segments have just incredible margins.  And if you think about it from a historical perspective, going back to look just at 2011, not very long ago, our collected EBITDA is up about 580 basis points since the third quarter of 2011. And also you want to remember when we report EBITDA, almost all of our D&A is really just noncash amortization. And unlike depreciation, that noncash amortization has no call on future capital spending. 
Also, you can see Medical and RF are still over 2/3rds of our total EBITDA. 
Next slide. So we look at the smallest segment, Energy Systems & Controls. We went into the year saying that about 60% of that segment would be in oil and gas, and that's actually going to be slightly less than that, just due to the sales. But notwithstanding that, we had a lot of FX exposure, of course, in Energy with a lot of non-U.S. activity, so FX was a negative 5% headwind in the quarter. The oil and gas markets were about as weak as we expected, in fact, when we look back about how they performed versus how we modeled them, there was literally no variance. 
The other served markets were flat with a few modest exceptions that were up. We had really terrific margin performance as everybody executed very nimbly, terrific deleverage performance. And the operating margin is actually up 60 basis points from a year ago, and I think notably, it's up 330 basis points from what we reported in the second quarter. So we've gone from 26% OP margin to 29.3% sequentially on effectively the same revenue. So that's quite an accomplishment. I think everybody in the segment, to the most part, deserves a lot of credit for that. 
When we look at it's trending into Q4, what we would see is sort of the same level of weakness, but some incremental improvement just because of some seasonal programs that tend to occur inside energy. But with energy being less than 1 in every $7 of revenue, it won't have a big effect for us. 
We had strong growth in our nuclear test business on improving market conditions. There is a good deal of activity that's emerging both in China and Korea-based opportunity in the Middle East and start-ups, again, in Japan for the nuclear activity, so that's going to be a material improvement for us in the fourth quarter and into 2016. 
The cost actions that we took earlier this year, you can see, have already improved our margins here in the third quarter, and we expect the margins to improve still a bit more into the fourth quarter of this year. 
Next slide. The Industrial Technology segment, which is about 10% of oil and gas by the way, a little less in this quarter, it had a 4% hit on FX. We also have, in the Industrial Technology segment, the city of Toronto rolloff from Neptune, which we said this year would be in the neighborhood of $40 million or about $8 million to $9 million a quarter, and that's about what it was in this quarter, so that's most of the organic issue. 
Neptune, on the other hand, grew mid-single digits, excluding the completion of Toronto projects, so we were pleased with that. And oil and gas markets were almost exactly as we expected them in here, but the margins remain really strong when you think about the challenges those folks had. They could have done a little better job on deleveraging, and we've talked to them about that and I think we'll see better performance in that respect in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to have growth in our material analysis businesses, and they are holding up very well given their European and Asian exposure. 
In the fourth quarter, we already announced as of October 2 that we completed the divestiture of ABEL Pumps. That was a business that we sold for EUR 95 million. It has very strong fourth quarter, so the buyer will be benefited by that. We had it projected in our guidance at about $14 million of revenue and about $0.03 a share of earnings, which of course now goes away. 
On the other hand, we get EUR 95 million and have already effectively reinvested that money in the acquisitions we've just made in higher-margin businesses that don't require the assets that ABEL was going to require to sustain its growth. 
Oil and gas is still week, but growth in the other markets is pretty good and is offsetting, for the most part, the oil and gas weakness. 
We do think in the fourth quarter, we'll have better margins, with better leverage performance. 
Next slide. We look here at RF Technology. We were up, as you can see, 6% revenue and up 10% in operating profit. If you look at that operating margin at 3-point -- 30.3%, up 120 basis points, want to remind us that the EBITDA margin in this segment is 35.7%, so we have a lot of noncash amortization and the 35.7 number demonstrates just how powerful the cash earnings profile of the RF Technology segment is. 
Organic revenue was up 4, FX was a 1% headwind. The growth continued in our Infinity Lane Systems, both in Florida and Texas, and we have a number of quotations out so that looks very favorable as we go into next year. 
We had quite reasonable subscriber additions in our various freight matching businesses that supported growth in the quarter. 
And then we acquired RF IDeas in September, and that business has historically grown at double digits, and we certainly expect that, that will be the case in the future, both Rick and Greg, who are driving that business, have been there a long time, they have created unbelievable value-added reseller network and terrific direct connectivity with OEMs, primarily the business provides proprietary card reading technology, so you can think of it doing for the individual what Neptune reader technology does for a big collective entity. Lots of identification and authenticity ID that they have, a lot of it is for single sign-on things like printers. They are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications and thousands of customers. It's quite a decent balance sheet. As you might imagine as our deals are. 
If we look to the fourth quarter, the software business as we think will continue to grow at mid-single digits. We'll get great leverage out of them and terrific cash flow performance. 
The backlog and proposal activity that we have at toll and traffic is pretty good. We don't see any slowing in that arena. We'll finally get done with a couple of projects, which have been things that have been challenging to say the least that will be behind us. That's really good news. And then we'll have very strong segment margin performance, we think, continuing, led by our SaaS and application software businesses. 
Last Wednesday, we completed the acquisition of Aderant. Aderant is really an incredible company. If we turn to slide here, we can look at a detailed explanation of Aderant. It's just in a sense, it's just a great business. It has lots of complimentary notes that have come to us from various admirers of Aderant and Chris Giglio's team. I think we've never had as many unsolicited inbound notes about what a great business this is, and thank goodness it's finally in the home of a public company that will continue to invest in it. There's been an amount of fear, may be unwarranted, but nonetheless very real from law firms, who I'm sure, wouldn't shock you that they tend to be somewhat conservative who were not too happy to see Aderant in the hands of private equity previously. And it always makes people worry about whether they can depend on continued internal development and growth. Aderant has really end-to-end platform of mission-critical software that primarily goes to law firms now but could be expanded to other professional services organizations. 
It has 3,000 of the world's largest law firms and professional services organizations, and they really do a full suite of activity all the way from time capturing and billing to docketing. They're in Atlanta, they've got a great software business also in Auckland, New Zealand, which we're very encouraged by. 
We think they're going to generate over $125 million of revenue in 2016 and beyond. And of course, it is, as always, a high-margin business. 
If you look at our acquisition criteria on the right, you'll see it's got excellent management team. In fact, we're retaining everyone so they have to check the box. High recurring revenue, yes, you can check that box, over 95% customer retention. Strong cash flow characteristics, asset light, well yes, once again negative working capital so people pay us in advance for work that we're going to eventually perform. Very deep domain experience inside in terms of people who are accustomed and used to working with law firms and what their needs really are. And it has multiple growth opportunities, including opportunities to do additional acquisitions at Aderant, which is one of the things that we've been so encouraged by these last 3 larger transactions in the form of Sunquest, which you see us doing, continual bolt-ons too and MHA, which we continue to do and now Aderant, which is the third largest acquisitions that we've made, we'll have a very strong forward opportunity to continue to add businesses to this very, very good platform.  It's another great niche software business for us. 
Next slide. We look at Medical Solutions, and it will have really drop the reference to Scientific Imaging. I mean, the reality is that it's no longer very material. In the quarter, the Scientific Image business had about a 6% decline, all of which really was our rugged mobile business, which we have been just gradually winding down. As you recall, we sold the Black Diamond business that was reported in RF, but it had both DAP and JLT and these things should be pretty well cycled through before the end of the year. If it weren't for that Medical would have -- I'm sorry, Scientific Imaging would have been flat in the quarter. 
You can see that the Medical businesses grew organically by about 5%, while total revenue was up 12% because of the acquisition content. FX in the segment was 3% headwind. 
We had continued growth at MHA with significant customer acquisitions and Mike Sicilian and his team were able to acquire Atlantic Healthcare Partners, which is really a vaccine GPO, but it gives us a new channel direct to physician offices. It will contribute meaningfully to our EBITDA in 2016 and is a terrific acquisition, and so congratulations to Mike, and Jason Conely, and others there. 
Our recurring revenue increased at Sunquest, which was good sign. We really do believe Sunquest is going to be positioned for a strong 2016 and everything that we've seen as we continue to do these acquisitions, we'll talk about in a second, so just so we're putting together quite impressive platform of opportunities over a long period of time at Sunquest. 
Our Medical Device businesses were quite strong, driven by new product introductions and the execution around introducing those at both Verathon and Northern Digital. Those certainly outperforming the rest of our Medical product businesses. 
Our recent acquisitions that we've done this year, all of which are performing above our internal plans for how they would do. 
We signed an agreement, just sort of virtually within the last couple of days, to acquire CliniSys Group U.K. It's a leading provider of hospital laboratory software and so just think about it basically as being the Sunquest of Europe. It has a sort of an elongated customary merger control review process that will happen in the U.K. and Europe. We expect that we should be able to get that all closed out, and it ought to be inside our reporting entity by maybe the end of January or certainly, early in 2016. 
We invested $170 million -- I'm sorry, GBP 170 million in that business, but all CliniSys will be paid for from our non-U.S. cash. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll continue to have like mid-single digit organic growth in the Medical businesses, gross margins will continue as incredible as they are today. And once again, you look at the OP margin, we reported 36.6%, but remember that the EBITDA margin is 45%, so lots of non-cash detractors on the OP margin can confuse people about how great and powerful these businesses are on a cash earnings basis. 
We continue to have outstanding margin and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter. Our Atlas Medical acquisition, which literally we finished yesterday, will also expand our laboratory connectivity. This is really an amazing business. It's been developed by founder, Rob Atlas, who is extremely well known in the hospital arena. And Rob will be joining the Sunquest team. Atlas Medical, his business will really be a bolt-on for Sunquest, but it provides support mechanism to both Sunquest and Data Innovations. 
The connectivity solutions are basically thinking about the lab to the physician outreach that a hospital would have and then within the hospital, the concept of lab-to-lab communication where oftentimes people can't see the data they want, that results in unnecessary additional tests. 
We like the whole concept with coordinated diagnostics inside the hospital. We really believe that this gives us a preeminent edge over what other people do in this category and over time, you'll hear us talk more and more about Sunquest and Atlas as a combination. 
Next slide. Here we'll look at the guidance for the year. 
Next slide. We updated our guidance, actually, raised the guidance for the full year to $6.69 to $6.75. Previously, it was $6.61 to $6.75, so this moves the midpoint up from $6.68 to $6.72, so it's a 4-point increase, $0.04 a share increase. 
But remember, this is despite ABEL leaving and ABEL will cost us $0.03, maybe $0.04 during this.  So if we had not sold ABEL, we would have raised the high-end a little more, but we have to absorb that offset. 
And again, when you look at the cash conversion, third quarter was 137%, cash conversion for the year certainly should exceed 130%. So the DEPS number is one thing, but the cash performance is quite much more important. 
We also raised our operating cash flow target to between $925 million to $940 million for the full year, and that's another projected increase from what we suggested in the past and CapEx is not running very high this year, less than $40 million, so it's going to promote a lot of free cash flow. 
Next slide. So we go to the summary here for the third quarter. Really, a record quarter despite the headwinds, so I'm not sure we could have expected to do as well as we did and we're quite pleased with the performance. Book-to-bill at 1.01x is a good sign for the fourth quarter and gross margins with -- reaching 60.7%, I went back to look at where we were in the third quarter in 2011 and we were at 53.7% gross margins, so we've added 700 basis points to our gross margins in the last 4 years here in the third quarter. Our operating margin is 28.7% and our EBITDA margin is 34.4%. And if you go back to the third quarter of 2011, you'll see EBITDA was about 28.6%, and now it's 34.4%. 
Our DEPS of $1.61 exceeded our guidance. Free cash flow, 25% of revenue and 137% conversion. 
Our full year DEPS raised and cash flow guidance raised. We deployed $435 million in 3 terrific acquisitions. And then just as we begin this quarter, we acquired Aderant, our third largest transaction in our history and yesterday, signed an agreement to acquire Atlas Medical. 
So we were able to confirm everything we thought that would happen in the fourth quarter and really believe we're very well positioned to have a record 2016, but we wont provide guidance around that until we report earnings in January. 
So with that, John, I think we're ready for opening up for questions."

So we don't want to go into some situation where people are going to write software off of our software. We're really providing some kind of service to somebody who happen to be using software to achieve the benefit of what it is. But you have to have domain experience. So our guys at the core aren't software people, they're domain experts who use software to create a solution for somebody that's efficient and effective for them. So as long as we continue to see things that are in those spaces, we'll be able to make the acquisitions. A couple of sessions ago, I said, when we did Sunquest and we did MHA, they were really, really as important for the future of Roper Technologies as Neptune and TransCore were back in 2003 and '04 for Roper Industries. Sunquest and MHA gives us world-class leadership organization that allow us to do bolt-on acquisitions and things that are complementary to them and most of what we've done this year has something to do with one or the other of those organizations. Aderant is similarly positioned to do that. It's a great organization. You go back and look at Chris Giglio, he did a YouTube video on the day of the acquisition that was just brilliant. And you can see how he's expressing the fact that now being owned by public company, people and his customers can have confidence that they'll get the continued investment for his program to continue to account the most important player in that area. So we're always kind of agnostic about what it is the business does. So we don't really have a boundary around the business as long as it hits the excellent magic team, high recurring revenue, great cash flow, prefer to have view of any assets and domain experience, then we're pretty wide open on where we would deploy our capital. Now, we also have some internal things we always want to be able to add value to the business and some meaningful way that we can understand. And we want to think that people working in our governing system will perform better than they were when they weren't in it, and if we think in our diligence process that neither of those would happen, then we would abandon the deal."

You get rid of the city of Toronto drag, which to their, and get rid of the rugged mobile, kind of winding that thing down, and we just get rid of a lot of drags and -- so organic bees will be more favorable next year."

We think they're valued pretty highly inside our overall portfolio. I think people approach us, I mean, our phone rang off the hook when people saw -- when we sold Noble, everybody in the world is calling us up about, hey, can we buy your pump businesses, can we buy your Energy business, can we do this, can we do that? The answer is no. I mean, what are you talking about? You guys trade at a multiple that's lower than the imputed value on our business. And if we're going to do anything we're going to do it for shareholders. Shareholders get a premium to what they would be. So I do think there are creative things that people kind of approach us on, and are always willing to listen to various things, but we like the businesses that we own today for the most part."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.ropertech.com. 
So if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation available on our website. 
For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of purchase accounting adjustments one to defer to acquired deferred revenue in our recent software acquisitions, that totals $2.2 million. 
In addition, we have an inventory step-up expense for RF IDeas of $2 million. 
As a reminder, these adjustments represent adjustments that, absent our acquisition, those businesses would have been able to show their profitability and revenue. 
Now if you please turn the slide, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?"

So we start here with our Q3 Enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought was significant given the sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actua",3829,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. 
So we start here with our Q3 Enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought was significant given the sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actually was modestly up from last year at $886 million and our book-to-bill was 1.01x and above 1 most everywhere, with the exception of RF which is, of course, project-driven. 
Growth was led by Medical, which was up 12% in revenue and RF Technology, which was up 6% in revenue. The declines that we saw in the Industrial and Energy were virtually exactly as we had modeled. 
FX was about a 3% headwind in the quarter and that resulted in a bit of negative Organic as you can see there's about 2 of those Industrial and Energy headwinds. 
Gross margins were spectacular. They were up 130 basis points to 60.7% over last year and even up sequentially from the second quarter. 
EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points to 34.4%, both records. Net earnings were up 4% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus our guidance of $1.53 to $1.57. 
Our free cash flow was $220 million, which was up sharply from the second quarter's $162 million, and the $220 million of free cash flow represents 137% conversion. 
We deployed $435 million in 3 acquisitions, RF IDeas, Atlantic Health Partners and On Center, which we have discussed earlier. 
And we just completed the Aderant acquisition on Wednesday, which was a $675 million net of tax benefit acquisition, we'll talk more about this morning. And today, we're announcing 2 more transactions CliniSys Group and Atlas Medical. So it was really an outstanding quarter and of course, great capital deployment for us. 
Next slide. If you look at the income statement, we're sort of laughing because if the old story about the ducks on the pond and they're moving along nicely but underneath, their feet are moving wildly. Lots of activity, but at the end of the day, we're up $1 million. But you got to know that, that's in the face of oil and gas being down about 3% of our entire revenue and FX about 3% and of course, the city of Toronto roll up, another one, so we had to overcome quite a bit of headwinds and still produce positive results. 
Our gross margin was up from 59.4% a year ago to 60.7%, and it really demonstrates the quality of our businesses because even in these difficult markets, they not only are holding their gross margins, but are oftentimes, increasing them. 
If you look at the operating margin it, too, shows an incredible execution, 27.9% a year ago and 28.7% this year, up 80 basis points despite having quite a bit of M&A expenses that we took in during the quarter for all this activity. 
You can see that tax rate was 30.4%, which was a little bit lower than last year's 31.3%. But I'd remind you, our second quarter, it was only 25.7% so there was a $0.12 headwind relative to Q2 on the tax rate and the tax rate gave us about $0.02 favorable in the quarter. And then you can see the DEPS at $1.61. 
Next slide. The compounding of cash flow, if there's any theme around here, it would be that, that we are a base compounder. 
You can see our cash flow, our operating cash flow has gone up from $579 million during the first 3 quarters of last year to $660 million now. The operating cash flow conversion was 141%. Our free cash flow conversion was 137%, and what we always ask people to look at even though we don't report on a cash earnings per-share basis, if you take a look here at our revenue, free cash flow, you'll see that 25% of our revenue turned into free cash flow in the quarter. 
Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 15% over last year at $632 million, and we still do think cash is the best measure of performance. 
Next slide. We continue to look at the balance sheet and our asset velocity. You'll see that we've improved another 160 basis points from the third quarter of '14 to the third quarter of this year. Everything is better, inventory is down, receivables are down, payables are up, and so the net effect is we go from 5.8% at the end of the third quarter last year to 4.2% now and our governance process just continues to drive the working capital focus for everyone here throughout the entity. 
Next slide. We look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with very strong balance sheet. We had $700 million in cash, lot of that's outside the U.S., of course, an undrawn revolver giving us sort of cash and undrawn revolver capacity of about $1.6 billion and our gross net number, you can see there is at about $2.8 billion. 
Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is about $1.239 billion, that's not pro forma, that's just the actual number. Pro forma would be higher, of course, with our acquisitions, giving us a gross debt-to-EBITDA profile of about 2.3x. 
Our pipeline opportunities are still really quite good, so we're going to continue to see acquisitions flowing here in 2016. 
We're rapidly getting to the point where we're going to have $1 billion dollars of cash flow very soon on an annual basis. And of course, we tend to reinvest that at about 1.3 to 1.5x that cash flow so we still look forward to another $1.5 billion or so of investment opportunity next year. 
The Aderant transaction, of course, is going to be around $695 million in terms of -- the cash cost to that, so that will take up the rest of our revolver. And as a result, we've upsized the revolver from its $1.5 billion to $1.850 billion. 
And the CliniSys transaction will be the -- basically funded out of non-U.S. cash so there's no new borrowing required, so it gives us a very strong balance sheet. 
Next slide. Here, we just have a placeholder before we start talking about our segment deal and the outlook. 
Next slide. If you look at the performance of all 4 of the segments, they continue to be just marvelous. Here you are with these headwinds, currency challenges and everything else in Energy and yet our EBITDA margins in the quarter were 33%. 
Our Industrial Technology, which is only about 10%, affected by oil and gas still had 31% EBITDA margins, while RF had 36% and Medical, 45%. So all of these segments have just incredible margins. And if you think about it from a historical perspective, going back to look just at 2011, not very long ago, our collected EBITDA is up about 580 basis points since the third quarter of 2011. And also you want to remember when we report EBITDA, almost all of our D&A is really just noncash amortization. And unlike depreciation, that noncash amortization has no call on future capital spending. 
Also, you can see Medical and RF are still over 2/3 of our total EBITDA. 
Next slide. So we look at the smallest segment, Energy Systems & Controls. We went into the year saying that about 60% of that segment would be in oil and gas, and that's actually going to be slightly less than that, just due to the sales. But notwithstanding that, we had a lot of FX exposure, of course, in Energy with a lot of non-U.S. activity, so FX was a negative 5% headwind in the quarter. The oil and gas markets were about as weak as we expected, in fact, when we look back about how they performed versus how we modeled them, there was literally no variance. 
The other served markets were flat with a few modest exceptions that were up. We had really terrific margin performance as everybody executed very nimbly, terrific deleverage performance. And the operating margin is actually up 60 basis points from a year ago, and I think notably, it's up 330 basis points from what we reported in the second quarter. So we've gone from 26% OP margin to 29.3% sequentially on effectively the same revenue. So that's quite an accomplishment. I think everybody in the segment, to the most part, deserves a lot of credit for that. 
When we look at it, it's trending into Q4, what we would see is sort of the same level of weakness, but some incremental improvement just because of some seasonal programs that tend to occur inside Energy. But with Energy being less than 1 in every $7 of revenue, it won't have a big effect for us. 
We had strong growth in our nuclear test business on improving market conditions. There is a good deal of activity that's emerging both in China and Korea-based opportunity in the Middle East and start-ups, again, in Japan for the nuclear activity, so that's going to be a material improvement for us in the fourth quarter and into 2016. 
The cost actions that we took earlier this year, you can see, have already improved our margins here in the third quarter, and we expect the margins to improve still a bit more into the fourth quarter of this year. 
Next slide. The Industrial Technology segment, which is about 10% of oil and gas by the way, a little less in this quarter, it had a 4% hit on FX. We also have, in the Industrial Technology segment, the city of Toronto rolloff from Neptune, which we said this year would be in the neighborhood of $40 million or about $8 million to $9 million a quarter, and that's about what it was in this quarter, so that's most of the organic issue. 
Neptune, on the other hand, grew mid-single digits, excluding the completion of Toronto projects, so we were pleased with that. And oil and gas markets were almost exactly as we expected them in here, but the margins remain really strong when you think about the challenges those folks had. They could have done a little better job on deleveraging, and we've talked to them about that and I think we'll see better performance in that respect in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to have growth in our material analysis businesses, and they are holding up very well given their European and Asian exposure. 
In the fourth quarter, we already announced as of October 2 that we completed the divestiture of ABEL Pumps. That was a business that we sold for EUR 95 million. It has very strong fourth quarter, so the buyer will be benefited by that. We had it projected in our guidance at about $14 million of revenue and about $0.03 a share of earnings, which of course now goes away. 
On the other hand, we get EUR 95 million and have already effectively reinvested that money in the acquisitions we've just made in higher-margin businesses that don't require the assets that ABEL was going to require to sustain its growth. 
Oil and gas is still weak, but growth in the other markets is pretty good and is offsetting, for the most part, the oil and gas weakness. 
We do think in the fourth quarter, we'll have better margins, with better leverage performance. 
Next slide. We look here at RF Technology. We were up, as you can see, 6% revenue and up 10% in operating profit. If you look at that operating margin at 3-point -- 30.3%, up 120 basis points, want to remind us that the EBITDA margin in this segment is 35.7%, so we have a lot of noncash amortization and the 35.7% number demonstrates just how powerful the cash earnings profile of the RF Technology segment is. 
Organic revenue was up 4, FX was a 1% headwind. The growth continued in our Infinity Lane Systems, both in Florida and Texas, and we have a number of quotations out so that looks very favorable as we go into next year. 
We had quite reasonable subscriber additions in our various freight matching businesses that supported growth in the quarter. 
And then we acquired RF IDeas in September, and that business has historically grown at double digits, and we certainly expect that, that will be the case in the future, both Rick and Greg, who are driving that business, have been there a long time, they have created unbelievable value-added reseller network and terrific direct connectivity with OEMs, primarily the business provides proprietary card reading technology, so you can think of it doing for the individual what Neptune reader technology does for a big collective entity. Lots of identification and authenticity [ph] ID that they have, a lot of it is for single sign-on things like printers. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications and thousands of customers. It's quite a decent balance sheet, as you might imagine, as our deals are.
If we look to the fourth quarter, the software business as we think will continue to grow at mid-single digits. We'll get great leverage out of them and terrific cash flow performance. 
The backlog and proposal activity that we have at toll and traffic is pretty good. We don't see any slowing in that arena. We'll finally get done with a couple of projects, which have been things that have been challenging to say the least that will be behind us. That's really good news. And then we'll have very strong segment margin performance, we think, continuing, led by our SaaS and application software businesses. 
Last Wednesday, we completed the acquisition of Aderant. Aderant is really an incredible company. If we turn to slide here, we can look at a detailed explanation of Aderant. It's just -- in a sentence, it's just a great business. It has lots of complementary notes that have come to us from various admirers of Aderant and Chris Giglio's team. I think we've never had as many unsolicited inbound notes about what a great business this is, and thank goodness it's finally in the home of a public company that will continue to invest in it. There's been an amount of fear, may be unwarranted, but nonetheless very real from law firms, who, I'm sure, it wouldn't shock you that they tend to be somewhat conservative who were not too happy to see Aderant in the hands of private equity previously. And it always makes people worry about whether they can depend on continued internal development and growth. Aderant has really end-to-end platform of mission-critical software that primarily goes to law firms now but could be expanded to other professional services organizations. 
It has 3,000 of the world's largest law firms and professional services organizations, and they really do a full suite of activity all the way from time capturing and billing to docketing. They're in Atlanta, they've got a great software business also in Auckland, New Zealand, which we're very encouraged by. 
We think they're going to generate over $125 million of revenue in 2016 and beyond. And of course, it is, as always, a high-margin business. 
If you look at our acquisition criteria on the right, you'll see it's got excellent management team. In fact, we're retaining everyone so that's a ""check the box."" High recurring revenue, yes, you can check that box, over 95% customer retention. Strong cash flow characteristics, asset light, well yes, once again negative working capital so people pay us in advance for work that we're going to eventually perform. Very deep domain experience inside in terms of people who are accustomed and used to working with law firms and what their needs really are. And it has multiple growth opportunities, including opportunities to do additional acquisitions at Aderant, which is one of the things that we've been so encouraged by these last 3 larger transactions in the form of Sunquest, which you see us doing, continual bolt-ons to and MHA, which we continue to do and now Aderant, which is the third largest acquisitions that we've made, we'll have a very strong forward opportunity to continue to add businesses to this very, very good platform. It's another great niche software business for us. 
Next slide. We look at Medical Solutions, and have really dropped the reference to Scientific Imaging. I mean, the reality is that it's no longer very material. In the quarter, the Scientific Image business had about a 6% decline, all of which really was our rugged mobile business, which we have been just gradually winding down. As you recall, we sold the Black Diamond business that was reported in RF, but it had both DAT and JLT and these things should be pretty well cycled through before the end of the year. If it weren't for that Medical would have -- I'm sorry, Scientific Imaging would have been flat in the quarter. 
You can see that the Medical businesses grew organically by about 5%, while total revenue was up 12% because of the acquisition content. FX in the segment was 3% headwind. 
We had continued growth at MHA with significant customer acquisitions and Mike Sicilian and his team were able to acquire Atlantic Healthcare Partners, which is really a vaccine GPO, but it gives us a new channel direct to physician offices. It will contribute meaningfully to our EBITDA in 2016 and is a terrific acquisition, and so congratulations to Mike, and Jason Conely, and others there. 
Our recurring revenue increased at Sunquest, which was good sign. We really do believe Sunquest is going to be positioned for a strong 2016 and everything that we've seen as we continue to do these acquisitions, we'll talk about in a second, so just so we're putting together quite impressive platform of opportunities over a long period of time at Sunquest. 
Our Medical Device businesses were quite strong, driven by new product introductions and the execution around introducing those at both Verathon and Northern Digital. Those are certainly outperforming the rest of our Medical product businesses. 
Our recent acquisitions that we've done this year, all of which are performing above our internal plans for how they would do. 
We signed an agreement, just sort of virtually within the last couple of days, to acquire CliniSys Group U.K. It's a leading provider of hospital laboratory software and so just think about it basically as being the Sunquest of Europe. It has a sort of an elongated customary merger control review process that will happen in the U.K. and Europe. We expect that we should be able to get that all closed out, and it ought to be inside our reporting entity by maybe the end of January or certainly, early in 2016. 
We invested $170 million -- I'm sorry, GBP 170 million in that business, but all CliniSys will be paid for from our non-U.S. cash. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll continue to have like mid-single digit organic growth in the Medical businesses, gross margins will continue as incredible as they are today. And once again, you look at the OP margin, we reported 36.6%, but remember that the EBITDA margin is 45%, so lots of non-cash detractors on the OP margin can confuse people about how great and powerful these businesses are on a cash earnings basis. 
We continue to have outstanding margin and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter. Our Atlas Medical acquisition, which literally we finished yesterday, will also expand our laboratory connectivity. This is really an amazing business. It's been developed by founder, Rob Atlas, who is extremely well known in the hospital arena. And Rob will be joining the Sunquest team. Atlas Medical, his business will really be a bolt-on for Sunquest, but it provides support mechanism to both Sunquest and Data Innovations. 
The connectivity solutions are basically thinking about the lab to the physician outreach that a hospital would have and then within the hospital, the concept of lab-to-lab communication where oftentimes people can't see the data they want, that results in unnecessary additional tests. 
We like the whole concept with coordinated diagnostics inside the hospital. We really believe that this gives us a preeminent edge over what other people do in this category and over time, you'll hear us talk more and more about Sunquest and Atlas as a combination. 
Next slide. Here we'll look at the guidance for the year. 
Next slide. We updated our guidance, actually, raised the guidance for the full year to $6.69 to $6.75. Previously, it was $6.61 to $6.75, so this moves the midpoint up from $6.68 to $6.72, so it's a 4-point increase, $0.04 a share increase. But remember, this is despite ABEL leaving and ABEL will cost us $0.03, maybe $0.04 during this. So if we had not sold ABEL, we would have raised the high-end a little more, but we have to absorb that offset. 
And again, when you look at the cash conversion, third quarter was 137%, cash conversion for the year certainly should exceed 130%. So the DEPS number is one thing, but the cash performance is quite much more important. 
We also raised our operating cash flow target to between $925 million to $940 million for the full year, and that's another projected increase from what we suggested in the past and CapEx is not running very high this year, less than $40 million, so it's going to promote a lot of free cash flow. 
Next slide. So we go to the summary here for the third quarter. Really, a record quarter despite the headwinds, so I'm not sure we could have expected to do as well as we did and we're quite pleased with the performance. Book-to-bill at 1.01x is a good sign for the fourth quarter and gross margins with -- reaching 60.7%, I went back to look at where we were in the third quarter in 2011 and we were at 53.7% gross margins, so we've added 700 basis points to our gross margins in the last 4 years here in the third quarter. Our operating margin is 28.7% and our EBITDA margin is 34.4%. And if you go back to the third quarter of 2011, you'll see EBITDA was about 28.6%, and now it's 34.4%. 
Our DEPS of $1.61 exceeded our guidance. Free cash flow, 25% of revenue and 137% conversion. 
Our full year DEPS raised and cash flow guidance raised. We deployed $435 million in 3 terrific acquisitions. And then just as we begin this quarter, we acquired Aderant, our third largest transaction in our history and yesterday, signed an agreement to acquire Atlas Medical. 
So we were able to confirm everything we thought that would happen in the fourth quarter and really believe we're very well positioned to have a record 2016, but we won't provide guidance around that until we report earnings in January. 
So with that, John, I think we're ready for opening up for questions."

So we don't want to go into some situation where people are going to write software off of our software. We're really providing some kind of service to somebody and we happen to be using software to achieve the benefit of what it is. But you have to have domain experience. So our guys at the core aren't software people, they're domain experts who use software to create a solution for somebody that's efficient and effective for them. So as long as we continue to see things that are in those spaces, we'll be able to make the acquisitions. A couple of sessions ago, I said, when we did Sunquest and we did MHA, they were really, really as important for the future of Roper Technologies as Neptune and TransCore were back in 2003 and '04 for Roper Industries. Sunquest and MHA gives us world-class leadership organization that allow us to do bolt-on acquisitions and things that are complementary to them and most of what we've done this year has something to do with one or the other of those organizations. Aderant is similarly positioned to do that. It's a great organization. You go back and look at Chris Giglio, he did a YouTube video on the day of the acquisition that was just brilliant. And you can see how he's expressing the fact that now being owned by public company, people and his customers can have confidence that they'll get the continued investment for his program to continue to account the most important player in that area. So we're always kind of agnostic about what it is the business does. So we don't really have a boundary around the business as long as it hits the excellent management team, high recurring revenue, great cash flow, prefer to have view of any assets and domain experience, then we're pretty wide open on where we would deploy our capital. Now, we also have some internal things. We always want to be able to add value to the business and some meaningful way that we can understand. And we want to think that people working in our governance system will perform better than they were when they weren't in it, and if we think in our diligence process that neither of those would happen, then we would abandon the deal."

We just signed the agreement when we're filing a lot of material like we do here with HSR, so that's all going into customary merger control reviews. So we've agreed with the seller that we're not going to provide any information until after the deal closes. So I can't tell you a lot about that. But the end markets are quite similar to what happens in here in the United States, the hospitals. While people think that there's universal health care in the U.K., there's actually a wide variety of provincial providers inside that system and CliniSys allows these people to have a uniform operating platform around all the things that go along with labs. And we'll be able to make them be more efficient for the health care system because they'll now get access to our Data Innovations technology and they'll get access to some of the ways we do things at Sunquest. So we think from an end-user viewpoint, the owner who has built this very good business in the U.K. and recently acquired a business similar to it in Germany, will benefit from providing additional services and clarity to the people that use [indiscernible] system to drive their laboratories. So we're bullish about that. But that's about as far as I can go, Joe."
