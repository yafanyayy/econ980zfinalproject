Our agenda this morning",2189,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you're joining us this morning with me on the call today or Vincent Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the President of our 4 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2014 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials, and we'll talk about the recent movement of the pound sterling, and then, we're going to take your questions.
On a number of fronts, 2014 was another very successful year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results in our Regulated Utility segment and a competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite the continued challenging market conditions. And we've made significant progress towards the spinoff of our supply business, which is designed to unlock significant value for our shareholders. The continued excellent performance of our utility, operations and our ongoing infrastructure investments in those companies, together with the successful restructuring of our corporate support functions, give us confidence in PPL's ability to achieve compound growth and earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the spinoff of supply business.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2014 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.85 from our 2013 results. Adjusting for special items, our 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, matching the level that we achieved in 2013, despite significantly lower hedged power prices in our supply business. I'm very pleased, we're able to match our 2013 ongoing earnings per share this year with a solid financial performance of our Regulated Utilities, primarily in Pennsylvania and the U.K., offsetting that $0.10 decline we saw in supply.
For the fourth quarter, reported earnings were $1.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $0.60 in 2013. For the year, our utility operations in United States and the United Kingdom include our earnings from ongoing operations by combined $116 million or 8.5%. The primary drivers for this impressive performance are returns on additional transmission investments of Pennsylvania, higher returns as a result of power plant environmental projects in Kentucky and higher utility revenues resulting from U.K. price increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 4 -- 5 rather for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. As we said in our news release this morning, going forward, we're excluding from our forecast any earnings from our supply business and the net cost associated with the supply spinoff. We believe this approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the ongoing portfolio of PPL. As we previously communicated, we're restricted in providing supply or Talen forecast while in registration with the SEC. We appreciate everyone's patience during this process, and know that Paul and his team are very excited to communicate the full Talen story, which will occur as soon as possible following the spend. We provide an update to PPL Energy Supply's hedge profile in the appendix of today's presentation material, consistent with the prior practice.
Our 2015 forecast range for earnings from our Regulated Utility operations is $2.05 to $2.25 per share, unchanged from what we provided with our June announcement of the Talen transaction. The midpoint of this range is $2.15, which is 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted Regulated Utility earnings from ongoing operations were more supply earnings and includes the full impact of dyssynergies related to the spinoff of supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.
As I mentioned earlier, the excellent performance of our prior utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments gives us great confident in our ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following this supply spinoff. The slide shows that we're anticipating slight increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. The slide also shows a significant improvement in the Corporate and Other categories that we expect to realize as a result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the 75 million of dyssynergies we discussed at the time of the announcement. In addition to the Talen spinoff, 2015 is a transitional year for PPL in many other ways. In the U.K., we're moving to the REO regulatory construct, and we are in rate cases in Kentucky and expect to file rate case during the year in Pennsylvania as well.
Growth in earnings in 2015 comes largely from the corporate restructuring efforts, but growth beyond 2015 will be driven by our utility companies.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Regulated operations. We're very pleased to know that WPD was recently named Utility of the Year by the International Addition of Utility Week. This marks back-to-back years that PPL companies were named Utility of the Year. In judging WPD as the winner, a panel of industry experts scrutinized the business performance in terms of customer satisfaction, stakeholder return, sustainability and corporate social responsibility, staff development and stakeholder relationship. We congratulate the employees of WPD for this impressive achievement, and this recognition underscores the value we see in our U.K. business, as a key component of the portfolio going forward. Back in the U.S., progress is continuing on a rate cases Kentucky. As we told you on November, we've requested increases in annual based electro grades of $30 million and $150 million at LG&E and KU, respectively, and an increase in annual-based gas rates of $14 million at LG&E. The increases are principally driven by investments in generation supply and other infrastructure investments needed to maintain and enhance the safe and reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers and to meet federal environmental regulations. We anticipate that the new rates will go into effect on July 1st of this year. A time line for the rate case consideration is included in today's appendix.
In 2014, we also continue to focus on major capital projects in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with capital spending for the domestic utilities of approximately $2.3 billion during the year. In Pennsylvania, nearly $350 million was spent on our 2 largest transmission projects, Susquehanna-Roseland and the NorthWestern projects, which are now 95% and 60% complete, respectively. $140 million was spent on this projects improving the reliability of our distribution system, while earning a near real time return. In Kentucky, some key construction achievements were reached as new environmental systems were completed in 2014 for 2 of the units at our KU station, and 1 of the units at our LG&E station. And Gen land fill and as tranport system also became operational during the year. Construction of our new Kentucky combined cycle gas unit 7 is on schedule with commercial operation in the unit estimated to begin by the end of May this year.
Turning to Slide 7. Let's briefly discuss domestic weather normalized for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the year were essentially flat with lower residential and commercial sales being offset by continued strong industrial sector growth. Industrial sector growth is driven by solid production levels being be maintained by several of our manufacturing customers, amid improving economic conditions. Fourth quarter sales in Kentucky were lower because of the decline in residential and commercial sales, that was somewhat offset by industrial growth. The residential and commercial downturn is attributable to the continued slow growth or decline in several parts of Kentucky and Virginia.
As you can see, sales increased slightly in Pennsylvania in 2014, with the industrial category showing the strongest growth. The industrial sales growth is occurring, primarily, in this cement, metal and steel sectors. Pennsylvania weather-normalized sales in the fourth quarter showed slightly higher commercial sector use than was the case last year. That increase resulted from a higher customer account this year, as a result of improving economic conditions.
Moving to Slide 8. Looking back on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments at the Supply segment. In November, we completed the sale of the Montana Hydro electro facility to NorthWestern Energy for about $900 million. As a reminder, these cash proceeds remain with PPL following the spin, and we expect they use them to fund utility infrastructure investments and pay down holding company debt in Kentucky this year. Looking an overall portfolio performance, we executed very well in 2015, outperforming our initial margin projections due to expanded spread, fleet optimization and availability to our periods and our strategic hedging program that captured incremental value even when our units were on economic to dispatch.
You can see from the chart and the appendix on Slide 28 that we experienced some cold gas switching this year, as low gas prices enabled our combined cycle gas units to continue to run like baseload units. Further we see market reforms, such as PGM's proposed capacity performance product, the shift in the variable resource requirement curve and a recent increase in the offer cap, as constructive signal supporting the competitive power business in PGM for the future.
Next, I'd like to talk about our significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business, which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. Last week, we submitted our response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, accepting their proposed mitigation plan to address potential market power issues in mid-Atlantic region. The approval process is moving ahead as expected with the nuclear regulatory commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and we continue to anticipate approvals within our original projected timelines. The Talen Energy transition team headed by Paul Farr, President of PPL Energy Supply, has completed its staffing plan and continues to work towards their targeted synergies. We expect to close the Talen transaction in the second quarter of 2015.
Before we move on to Vince, I'll briefly provide you with an overview of our key objectives for 2015, which you'll see on Slide 9. Our primary objective, obviously, for this year, is the completion of the energy supply spinoff. In the U.K., our folks are focused on executing the new business plan that was accepted as part of the REO 81 process, which began April 1st of this year. In Kentucky, as mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with the efforts on our rate cases, and in Pennsylvania, while we don't have details on our filing, we do expect to file a distribution base case during the year.
In Kentucky, the major focus continues to be the execution of our generation and environmental construction projects, which are on schedule and on budget. In Pennsylvania, we're also focused on executing the large capital expenditure plan to continue to strengthen both our transmission and distribution systems.
And finally, we're very focused on implementing the corporate restructuring currently underway. We're confident that 2015 will be another solid year for PPL, as our employees implement our business plans to provide excellent service to customers and to continue to invest in infrastructure improvements. I'd like to take this opportunity to say that PPL employees have done an excellent job in designing and implementing a transition process that will launch a strong and streamline corporate structure for the new PPL as well as Talen Energy on course to operate safely and efficiently on day 1. 2014 was, obviously, an eventful year for PPL, one in which we began to place new paths in growing value for our shareholders, even while we continue to provide the highest quality of service to our customers.
Our high-level performance during this challenging year further strengthens my confidence that both PPL and Talen Energy will be very successful companies for years to come. PPL has a strong record of strategic and financial execution. As we enter a new phase of our evolution, we're confident that we will continue to provide shareowners with competitive returns and our customers with best-in-class reliability and service at reasonable cost. As a pure play electric utility going forward, we believe our 3 regulatory jurisdictions provide predictable earnings opportunities with timely recovery of investments.
Our Transmission business as grown rapidly, and we continue to identify additional projects that will drive further growth in that part of the business. We expect the Transmission business to be the fastest-growing part of our business before the foreseeable future. Finally, despite the recent decline in the British pound, we're confident in our ability to achieve an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%, given our current hedge levels and loan track record of successful hedging programs that are help drive our ability to meet or exceed earnings expectations. I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?"
185508,282841209,755385,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partial",2454,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partially offset by higher earnings from the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. Full year 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were the same as last year, both at $2.45 per share. Higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments were offset by lower earnings from the Supply segment and Corporate and Other. The $0.03 reduction in Corporate and Other is, primarily, driven by tax-related items and higher financing and other costs.
Let's move to a more detailed review of 2014 segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned a $1.37 per share in 2014, a $0.05 increase compared to 2013. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M due to lower pension expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes due to an increase in 2014 taxable dividend and from a 2013 positive adjustment related to an IRS ruling on our earnings to profit calculation. We also had higher depreciation from assets placement service and other of $0.03 per share.
One other item of note for the U.K. Regulated segment in an attempt to provide with additional visibility and transparency into the U.K. business, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC. PPL is, primarily, the U.K. Regulated segment, exclusive of the after-tax effect of allocated interest from the debt issued at PPL cap funding for the Midlands acquisition. We'll put those amounts, so you can reconcile the PPL Global LLC results to the results of the U.K. Regulated segment presented here today. We hope you'll find this additional disclosure useful. We're still assessing the format in which to provide this information, which we expect to furnish separately in 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.47 per share in 2014, a $0.01 decrease from 2013. This decrease was due to higher O&M, driven predominantly by timing of generation maintenance outages, strong related expenses and higher uncollectible accounts. Higher depreciation from assets placement service, higher financing costs from higher debt balance to fund CapEx and other of $0.03 per share. This decrease in earnings was almost fully offset by higher gross margins from returns on environmental capital investment and higher sales volume due to favorable weather. The other variances of negative $0.03 for both the Kentucky and U.K. Regulated segments is related to the way we compute diluted earnings per share using this converted method of accounting for the debt component of the equity unit. Not to get too technical, but the interest add back to income in 2013, was higher than the add back in 2014. And with no change in the number of shares outstanding, this had the effect of reducing EPS this year compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.40 per share in 2014, a $0.09 increase over 2013. This increase was due to higher delivery margins in both transmission and distribution from higher returns on additional capital investments and lower O&M. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions and higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx.
Finishing our segment review with supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.29 per share in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of $0.10 per share. This decrease was, primarily, due to lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by favorable baseload asset performance, gains on certain commodity positions and benefits of unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. Lower margins were partially offset by lower financing costs, primarily, due to a repayment of the lower amount debt in December of 2013, when we exited a lease and acquired that plant, and lower income taxes driven by chewing up our state effective tax rate at year end 2014, and a valuation allowance adjustment reported in 2013, related to deferred tax asset for state net operating loss.
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a work from our 2014 ongoing earnings of $2.45 to our 2014 adjusted utility earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03, which adjust for the Supply segment and related to synergies from the spin, as Bill described. This adjusted 2014 earnings amount is the starting point from which we are facing our 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate.
Starting from $2.45, we removed the current year supply earnings of $0.29. With that, adjusted for the $0.07 of O&M dyssynergies, previously discussed, this is the $75 million of indirect corporate cost that were allocated to supply, but do not go with supply as part of the spinoff. As we discussed, corporate restructuring effort currently underway is intended to eliminate this dyssynergy. We also adjusted for the $0.05 of interest on the $880 million of debt at PPL cap funding that was previously allocated to supply, but will remain with PPL Corp. This is a permanent dyssynergy. 
Finally, the adjusted the depreciation dyssynergies down from $0.03 previously disclosed to $0.01, since by the time we get to 2017, there is only $0.01 of depreciation dyssynergy remaining, as these assets are generally IT systems that have short useful life, and some of the assets become fully depreciated over this time period.
Turning to Slide 16. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 adjusted regulated utility ongoing earnings of $2.03 to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2015 ongoing Regulated Utility forecast. Corporate and Other is forecasted to contribute $0.11 to the improvement in 2015 earnings. As we implement the corporate restructuring, we expect to reduce the O&M dyssynergies of $0.07. And in 2014, we incurred about $0.02 of deferred tax asset adjustment that we do not expect to incur in 2015. 
In the U.K., as discussed previously, utility revenues will decrease by about $0.14, primarily, due to revenue profiling and a lower weighted average cost of capital, partially offset by inflation and other items, as we move into the REO ED1 price control beginning April 1 of this year. Offsetting lower revenues, our lower U.S. income tax is as a result of the decrease in taxable dividends and a higher British pound exchange rate for 2015, as a result of our hedging program. The hedge rate for 2015 is about $1.63 Compared to a realized hedge rate of $1.60 in 2014.
In Kentucky, we anticipate a slight increase in earnings with rate increases effective July 1. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by increases in O&M, due to higher pension and other labor related cost, higher depreciation on the increase plan service and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky. In Pennsylvania, we expect lower earnings in 2015, due primarily to higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. These negative drivers are expected to be partially offset by improved margins driven by increased transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital investments.
On Slide 17. We provide update on our free cash flow before dividends. Actual 2014 free cash flow before dividends was in line with the projection we provided last February, which if you recall included the proceeds from the sale of the Montana Hydro facilities. Looking at 2015, we are projecting a decrease in our free cash flow, primarily, driven by the $900 million Montana Hydro sale proceeds that we received in 2014, and the free cash flows of energy supply that are included in 2014 of about $200 million. 2015 cash from operations and capital expenditures exclude the Supply segment, except for $191 million of distributions to be received by court by the end of the first quarter with no additional distribution from supply thereafter.
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015 through 2019 are detailed on this slide, with Regulatory Utility investment totaling almost $18 billion over that period. This includes previously announced initiatives, such as the U.K. spending for our accepted ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plan in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations as well as focusing on system reliability and generation capacity replacement with the retirement of some of our in Kentucky, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. Our revised capital plan reflects incremental investment of approximately $900 million in Pennsylvania through 2018, including $500 million for transmission investment, including line rebuilds, new substations and substation security, and $200 million for distribution improvement, the smart meter replacement program and upgrades to our facility. Most of the increased distribution spend is recoverable to rate mechanisms, including the disk and the smart meter arrival. The revised plan also includes an  increase of over $270 million from 2015 to 2018 in Kentucky environmental spending due to increases in scope to meet the fluid and water guidelines and other projects related to cold combustion residuals, including ash pond closures. This increase partially offset the net reduction of about $600 million of spend from 2015 to 2018 from the deferral of the Green River CCD plan.
And finally, our capital plan is based on identifying projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.
Turning to Slide 19. Our updated investment plan drives a CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base to 2019, driving value for both our customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are targeting to achieve compound annual growth in earnings per share of 4% to 6% to at least 2017. At this time, I'll highlight certain key assumptions used for each segment, that supports the 4% to 6% earnings CAGR. For the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, assumptions contributing to this growth include the successful -- excuse me, execution of our capital plans for both transmission and distribution. Earnings growth through 2017 is based on transmission CapEx spend of $2.1 billion and distribution CapEx spend of $1.2 billion, with disk and smart meter CapEx contributing $530 million and $160 million, respectively. The successful distribution base rate case plan for 2015 with new rates effective in early 2016, and we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the Kentucky Regulated segment, key assumptions include the successful execution of our environmental CapEx program of $1.3 billion and the completion of the combined natural gas power plant. Successful completion of the current base rate cases with new rates effective July 1, 2015, and once again, we're assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the U.K. related segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem accepted ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provide 8 years of base revenue certainty, continued opportunity to outperform targets and the ability to true up certain costs, such as the annual change in the cost of debt and inflation, as determined by the U.K. RPI. We've also assumed a budgeted currency rate of $1.60 per pound. And for RPI under the Ofgem methodology, forecasted inflation rate used for the '15, '16 regulatory year is 2.6%, which will be chewed up for the actual realized inflation in the '17, '18 regulatory year. Our long range RPI assumption beyond '15, '16 is 3%. Incentive revenues are soon to be slightly higher for the 2014, '15 regulatory year compared $125 million for the regulatory year ended in March 2014. We assume incentive revenues decline from there, given the type of performance targets under ED1.
For Corporate and Other, we've built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings. At this point, we fully expect to be achieve this level of savings. We also assume equity issuances of $200 million annually, which is an increase of $100 million per year from our prior disclosure. This increase is to help fund the additional CapEx in the plant, while maintaining our strong credit metrics.
Moving to Slide 21. We know many of you have been focused on the recent movement in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate. We'd like to understand the effect that has on our earnings from WPD. The next couple of slides present information on our hedge levels and provide details that help us budgeted rate of $1.60 per pound. On this slide, we detail our hedging status for 2015 and 2016, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. First, we are nearly fully hedged at 97% for 2015, at an average rate of $1.63.
For 2016, we are 70% hedged at an average rate of $0.61. Since our third quarter update, we have laid down additional hedges for 2016 using callers to help protect against the further decline, but preserve some upside should the pound strengthen from its current position. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure in 2015, given our 97% hedge levels, and minimal exposure in 2016, even if rates stay at their current level.
Turning to Slide 22. As I just indicated, our business plan uses a $1.60 as the budgeted rate for open positions. While this rate is higher than the current spot rates, we believe it is indicative of a longer-term exchange rate based on historical data. First, the 5-year average rate was a $1.59, and the 10, 15, 20-year averages were all above $1.65.
Over the last 3 years when the exchange rate dip a low at $1.50, it was short lived as seen by the blue line. In the last 20 years, only 20 days went below $1.40. And about 90% of the time, the exchange rate was $1.50 or higher. Similar to the commodity hedge program we use to hedge our supply business, our foreign currency hedging program sets ranges as guidelines that provides flexibility to take advantage of periods of pound strengthening, as we did earlier in 2014 by increasing our hedge levels for 2015 and '16 and does not require us to fully hedge our exposure at lower levels.
As you are aware, we have been very successful with this strategy on the commodity side of our business. And as I detailed, this strategy is positioned us well for 2015 and '16. I know that was a lot, but that concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Post the spinoff of Talen, a large portion, more than 50% will come from the U.K., and historically, there've been very kind of differences in valuation methodologies, investors have used for non-U.S. utilities versus U.S. utilities.

And as we go forward, we're also looking at other ways in which we can highlight to investors the real significant value that we believe exist in the U.K. business. And some of that value is, obviously, shown self through our fast track that we just mentioned. As well as the fact that we're entering into a full 8-year period upon which we have a great deal of certainty on the revenues and the cost side. So we think it's a great business. It fits well with our portfolio to the extent that we cannot overcome, maybe, questions or concerns that investors have, we would, obviously, as you point out want to try to engage in activities that would either highlight that value or reweight the portfolio. But at this point, I don't think there is a need or desire to do any of that. And I would also mention that because our west businesses are growing much faster than the U.K. business, over time the waiting is going to come down for the U.K., just through our organic growth in the U.S. So I think over time, we'll continue to highlight the value in the business and make sure it's appropriately valued and look at any opportunity we need to make sure that shareowners get that value out of it."

Our agenda this morni",2195,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you're joining us this morning, with me on the call today are Vincent Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the Presidents of our 4 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2014 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials, and we'll talk about the recent movement of the pound sterling, and then, we're going to take your questions.
On a number of fronts, 2014 was another very successful year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results in our regulated utility segments and a competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite the continued challenging market conditions. And we made significant progress towards the spinoff of our supply business, which is designed to unlock significant value for our shareowners. The continued excellent performance of our utility, operations and our ongoing infrastructure investments in those companies together with the successful restructuring of our corporate support functions, give us confidence in PPL's ability to achieve compound growth and earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the spinoff of supply business.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2014 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.85 from our 2013 results. Adjusting for special items, our 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, matching the level that we achieved in 2013, despite significantly lower hedged power prices in our supply business. I'm very pleased, we're able to match our 2013 ongoing earnings per share this year with a solid financial performance of our regulated utilities, primarily in Pennsylvania and the U.K., offsetting the $0.10 decline we saw in supply.
For the fourth quarter, reported earnings were $1.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $0.60 in 2013. For the year, our utility operations in United States and the United Kingdom improved earnings from ongoing operations by combined $116 million or 8.5%. The primary drivers for this impressive performance are returns on additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania, higher returns as a result of power plant environmental projects in Kentucky and higher utility revenues resulting from U.K. price increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 4 -- 5 rather for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. As we said in our news release this morning, going forward, we're excluding from our forecast any earnings from our supply business and the net cost associated with the supply spinoff. We believe this approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the ongoing portfolio of PPL. As we previously communicated, we're restricted in providing supply or Talen forecast while in registration with the SEC. We appreciate everyone's patience during this process, I know that Paul and his team are very excited to communicate the full Talen story, which will occur as soon as possible following the spend. We provided an update to PPL Energy Supply's hedge profile in the appendix of today's presentation material, consistent with our prior practice.
Our 2015 forecast range for earnings from our regulated utility operations is $2.05 to $2.25 per share, unchanged from what we provided with our June announcement of the Talen transaction. The midpoint of this range is $2.15, which is 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations remove supply earnings and includes the full impact of  dissynergies related to the spinoff of supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.
As I mentioned earlier, the excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments gives us great confident in our ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the supply spinoff. The slide shows that we're anticipating slight increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. This slide also shows a significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as the result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time of the announcement. In addition to the Talen spinoff, 2015 is a transitional year for PPL in many other ways. In the U.K., we're moving to the RIIO regulatory construct, and we are in rate cases in Kentucky and expect to file rate case during the year in Pennsylvania as well.
Growth in earnings in 2015 comes largely from the corporate restructuring efforts, but growth beyond 2015 will be driven by our utility companies.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Regulated operations. We're very pleased to know that WPD was recently named Utility of the Year by the International Addition of Utility Week. This marks back-to-back years that PPL companies were named Utility of the Year. In judging WPD as the winner, a panel of industry experts scrutinized the business performance in terms of customer satisfaction, stakeholder return, sustainability and corporate social responsibility, staff development and stakeholder relationship. We congratulate the employees of WPD for this impressive achievement, and this recognition underscores the value we see in our U.K. business, as a key component of the portfolio going forward. Back in the U.S., progress is continuing on a rate cases in Kentucky. As we told you in November, we've requested increases in annual based electric rates of $30 million and $150 million at LG&E and KU, respectively, and an increase in annual-based gas rates of $14 million at LG&E. The increases are principally driven by investments in generation supply and other infrastructure investments needed to maintain and enhance the safe and reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers and to meet federal environmental regulations. We anticipate that the new rates will go into effect on July 1st of this year. A timeline for the rate case consideration is included in today's appendix.
In 2014, we also continue to focus on major capital projects in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with capital spending for the domestic utilities of approximately $2.3 billion during the year. In Pennsylvania, nearly $350 million was spent on our 2 largest transmission projects, Susquehanna-Roseland and the Northeast/Pocono projects, which are now 95% and 60% complete, respectively. $140 million was spent on this projects improving the reliability of our distribution system, while earning a near real time return. In Kentucky, some key construction achievements were reached as new environmental systems were completed in 2014 for 2 of the units at our KU gen station, and for 1 of the units at our LG&E Mill Creek station. The gen landfill and as tranport system also became operational during the year. Construction of our new Kentucky combined cycle gas unit Cane Run 7 is on schedule with commercial operation in the unit estimated to begin by the end of May this year.
Turning to Slide 7. Let's briefly discuss domestic weather normalized for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the year were essentially flat with lower residential and commercial sales being offset by continued strong industrial sector growth. Industrial sector growth is driven by solid production levels being maintained by several of our large manufacturing customers amid improving economic conditions. Fourth quarter sales in Kentucky were lower because of the decline in residential and commercial sales, that was somewhat offset by industrial growth. The residential and commercial downturn is attributable to the continued slow growth or decline in several rural parts of Kentucky and Virginia.
As you can see, sales increased slightly in Pennsylvania in 2014, with the industrial category showing the strongest growth. The industrial sales growth is occurring, primarily, in this cement, metal and steel sectors. Pennsylvania weather-normalized sales in the fourth quarter showed slightly higher commercial sector use than was the case last year. That increase resulted from a higher customer account this year, as a result of improving economic conditions.
Moving to Slide 8. Looking back on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments at the Supply segment. In November, we completed the sale of the Montana Hydro electro facilities to NorthWestern Energy for about $900 million. As a reminder, these cash proceeds remain with PPL following the spin, and we expect to use them to fund utility infrastructure investments and pay down holding company debt in Kentucky this year. Looking in overall portfolio performance, we executed very well in 2014, outperforming our initial margin projections due to expanded spark spreads, fleet optimization and availability during peak load periods and our strategic hedging program that captured incremental value even when our units were uneconomic to dispatch.
You can see from the chart and the appendix on Slide 28 that we experienced some coal-to-gas switching this year, as low gas prices enabled our combined cycle gas units to continue to run like baseload units. Further we see market reforms, such as PGM's proposed capacity performance product, the shift in the variable resource requirement curve and a recent increase in the offer cap, as constructive signal supporting the competitive power business in PGM for the future.
Next, I'd like to talk about our significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business, which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. Last week, we submitted a response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, accepting their proposed mitigation plan to address potential market power issues in the mid-Atlantic region. The approval process is moving ahead as expected with the nuclear regulatory commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and we continue to anticipate approvals within our original projected timelines. The Talen Energy transition team headed by Paul Farr, President of PPL Energy Supply, has completed its staffing plan and continues to work towards their targeted synergies. We expect to close the Talen transaction in the second quarter of 2015.
Before we move on to Vince, I'll briefly provide you with an overview of our key objectives for 2015, which you'll see on Slide 9. Our primary objective, obviously, for this year is the completion of the energy supply spinoff. In the U.K., our folks are focused on executing the new business plan that was accepted as part of the RIIO-ED1 process, which begins April 1st of this year. In Kentucky, as mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with the efforts on our rate cases, and in Pennsylvania, while we don't yet have details on our filing, we do expect to file a distribution base case during the year.
In Kentucky, the major focus continues to be the execution of our generation and environmental construction projects, which are on schedule and on budget. In Pennsylvania, we're also focused on executing the large capital expenditure plan to continue to strengthen both our transmission and distribution systems.
And finally, we're very focused on implementing the corporate restructuring currently underway. We're confident that 2015 will be another solid year for PPL, as our employees implement our business plans to provide excellent service to customers and to continue to invest in infrastructure improvements. I'd like to take this opportunity to say that PPL employees have done an excellent job in designing and implementing a transition process that will launch a strong and streamline corporate structure for the new PPL as well as set Talen Energy on course to operate safely and efficiently on Day 1. 2014 was, obviously, an eventful year for PPL, one in which we began to place new paths in growing value for our shareowners, even while we continue to provide the highest quality of service to our customers.
Our high-level performance during this challenging year further strengthens my confidence that both PPL and Talen Energy will be very successful companies for years to come. PPL has a strong record of strategic and financial execution. As we enter a new phase of our evolution, we're confident that we will continue to provide shareowners with competitive returns and our customers with best-in-class reliability and service at reasonable cost. As a pure play electric utility going forward, we believe our 3 regulatory jurisdictions provide predictable earnings opportunities with timely recovery of investments.
Our Transmission business has grown rapidly, and we continue to identify additional projects that will drive further growth in that part of the business. We expect the Transmission business to be the fastest growing part of our business for the foreseeable future. Finally, despite the recent decline in the British pound, we're confident in our ability to achieve an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%, given our current hedge levels and loan track record of successful hedging programs that will help drive our ability to meet or exceed earnings expectations. I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partial",2478,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partially offset by higher earnings from the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. Full year 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were the same as last year, both at $2.45 per share. Higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments were offset by lower earnings from the Supply segment and Corporate and Other. The $0.03 reduction in Corporate and Other is, primarily, driven by tax-related items and higher financing and other costs.
Let's move to a more detailed review of 2014 segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned a $1.37 per share in 2014, a $0.05 increase compared to 2013. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M due to lower pension expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes due to an increase in 2014 taxable dividends and from a 2013 positive adjustment related to an IRS ruling on our earnings to profits calculation. We also had higher depreciation from assets placement service and other of $0.03 per share.
One other item of note for the U.K. Regulated segment in an attempt to provide you with additional visibility and transparency into the U.K. business, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC. PPL Global is, primarily, the U.K. Regulated segment, exclusive of the after-tax effect of allocated interest from the debt issued at PPL cap funding for the Midlands acquisition. We'll footnote those amounts, so you can reconcile the PPL Global LLC results to the results of the U.K. Regulated segment presented here today. We hope you'll find this additional disclosure useful. We're still assessing the format in which to provide this information, which we expect to furnish separately in an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.47 per share in 2014, a $0.01 decrease from 2013. This decrease was due to higher O&M, driven predominantly by timing of generation maintenance outages, storm-related expenses and higher uncollectible accounts. Higher depreciation from assets placement service, higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx and other of $0.03 per share. This decrease in earnings was almost fully offset by higher gross margins from returns on environmental capital investment and higher sales volume due to favorable weather. The other variances of negative $0.03 for both the Kentucky and U.K. Regulated segments is related to the way we compute diluted earnings per share using these converted method of accounting for the debt component of the equity units. Not to get too technical, but the interest add back to net income in 2013, was higher than the add back in 2014. And with no change in the number of shares outstanding, this has the effect of reducing EPS this year compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.40 per share in 2014, a $0.09 increase over 2013. This increase was due to higher delivery margins in both transmission and distribution from higher returns on additional capital investments and lower O&M. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions and higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx.
Finishing our segment review with supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.29 per share in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of $0.10 per share. This decrease was, primarily, due to lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by favorable baseload asset performance, gains on certain commodity positions and the net benefits of unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. Lower margins were partially offset by lower financing costs, primarily, due to the repayment of the lower amount rental debt in December of 2013, when we exited a lease and acquired that plant, and lower income taxes driven by chewing up our state effective tax rate at year end 2014, and a valuation allowance adjustment reported in 2013 related to deferred tax assets for state net operating losses.
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 ongoing earnings of $2.45 to our 2014 adjusted utility earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03, which adjust for the Supply segment and are related to synergies from the spin, as Bill described. This adjusted 2014 earnings amount is the starting point from which we are basing our 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate.
Starting from $2.45, we removed the current year supply earnings of $0.29. We then adjusted for the $0.07 of O&M dissynergies, previously disclosed, this is the $75 million of indirect corporate cost that were allocated to supply, but do not go with supply as part of the spinoff. As we've discussed, corporate restructuring effort currently underway is intended to eliminate this dissynergy. We also adjusted for the $0.05 of interest on the $880 million of debt at PPL cap funding that was previously allocated to supply, but will remain with PPL Corp. This is a permanent dissynergy. 
Finally, we adjusted the depreciation dissynergies down from $0.03 previously disclosed to $0.01, since by the time we get to 2017, there is only $0.01 of depreciation dissynergy remaining, as these assets are generally IT systems that have short useful life, and some of the assets become fully depreciated over this time period.
Turning to Slide 16. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 adjusted regulated utility ongoing earnings of $2.03 to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2015 ongoing Regulated Utility forecast. Corporate and Other is forecasted to contribute $0.11 to the improvement in the 2015 earnings. As we implement the corporate restructuring, we expect to reduce the O&M dissynergies of $0.07. And in 2014, we incurred about $0.02 of deferred tax asset adjustments that we do not expect to incur in 2015. 
In the U.K., as discussed previously, utility revenues will decrease by about $0.14, primarily, due to revenue profiling and a lower weighted average cost of capital, partially offset by inflation and other items, as we move into the RIIO-ED1 price control period beginning April 1 of this year. Offsetting lower revenues, our lower U.S. income tax is as a result of the decrease in taxable dividends and a higher British pound exchange rate for 2015, as a result of our hedging program. The hedge rate for 2015 is about $1.63 compared to a realized hedge rate of $1.60 in 2014.
In Kentucky, we anticipate a slight increase in earnings with rate increases effective July 1. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by increases in O&M, due to higher pension and other labor related cost, higher depreciation on the increase plan and service, and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky. In Pennsylvania, we expect lower earnings in 2015, due primarily to higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. These negative drivers are expected to be partially offset by improved margins driven by increased transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital investments.
On Slide 17. We provide update on our free cash flow before dividends. Actual 2014 free cash flow before dividends was in line with the projection we provided last February, which if you recall included the proceeds from the sale of the Montana Hydro facilities. Looking at 2015, we are projecting a decrease in our free cash flow, primarily, driven by the $900 million Montana Hydro sale proceeds that we received in 2014, and the free cash flows of energy supply that are included in 2014 of about $200 million. 2015 cash from operations and capital expenditures exclude the Supply segment, except for $191 million of distributions to be received by court at the end of the first quarter with no additional distributions from the supply thereafter.
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015 through 2019 are detailed on this slide, with the Regulated Utility investment totaling almost $18 billion over that period. This includes previously announced initiatives, such as U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations as well as focusing on system reliability and generation capacity replacement with the retirement of some of our coal fleet in Kentucky, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. Our revised capital plan reflects incremental investment of approximately $900 million in Pennsylvania through 2018, including $500 million per transmission investments, including line rebuilds, new substations and substation security, and $200 million for distribution improvement, the smart meter replacement program and upgrades to our facilities. Most of the increased distribution spend is recoverable to rate mechanisms, including the disk and the smart meter rider. The revised plan also includes an increase of over $270 million from 2015 to 2018 in Kentucky environmental spending due to increases in scope to meet effluent water guidelines and other projects related to cold combustion residuals, including ash pond closures. This increase partially offsets the net reduction of about $600 million of spend from 2015 to '18 from the deferral of the Green River CCGT plan.
And finally, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.
Turning to Slide 19. Our updated investment plan drives a CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base to 2019, driving value for both our customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are targeting to achieve compound annual growth in earnings per share of 4% to 6% to at least 2017. At this time, I'll highlight certain key assumptions used for each segment, that supports the 4% to 6% earnings CAGR. For the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, assumptions contributing to this growth include the successful -- excuse me, execution of our capital plan for both transmission and distribution. Earnings growth through 2017 is based on transmission CapEx spend of $2.1 billion and distribution CapEx spend of $1.2 billion, with disk and smart meter CapEx contributing $530 million and $160 million, respectively. The successful distribution base rate case plan for 2015 with new rates effective in early 2016, and we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the Kentucky Regulated segment, key assumptions include the successful execution of our environmental CapEx program of $1.3 billion and the completion of the Cane Run combined cycle natural gas power plant. Successful completion of the current base rate cases with new rates effective July 1, 2015, and once again, we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provide 8 years of base revenue certainty, continued opportunity to outperform targets and the ability to true up certain costs, such as the annual change in the cost of debt and inflation, as determined by the U.K. RPI. We have also assumed a budgeted currency rate of $1.60 per pound. And for RPI under the Ofgem methodology, the forecasted inflation rate used for the '15, '16 regulatory year is 2.6%, which will be chewed up for the actual realized inflation in the '17, '18 regulatory year. Our long range RPI assumption beyond '15, '16 is 3%. Incentive revenues are soon to be slightly higher for the 2014, '15 regulatory year compared to the $125 million we earned for the regulatory year ended in March 2014. We assume incentive revenues decline from there, given the tighter performance targets under RIIO-ED1.
For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve this level of savings. We also assume equity issuances of $200 million annually, which is an increase of $100 million per year from our prior disclosure. This increase is to help fund the additional CapEx in the plant, while maintaining our strong credit metrics.
Moving to Slide 21. We know many of you have been focused on the recent movement in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate. We'd like to understand the effect it has on our earnings from WPD. The next couple of slides present information on our hedge levels and provide details that help us set a budgeted rate of $1.60 per pound. On this slide, we detail our hedging status for 2015 and 2016, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. First, we are nearly fully hedged at 97% for 2015, at an average rate of $1.63.
For 2016, we are 70% hedged at an average rate of $0.61. Since our third quarter update, we have layered on additional hedges for 2016 using callers to help protect against the further decline, but preserve some upside should the pound strengthen from its current position. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure in 2015, given our 97% hedge level and minimal exposure in 2016, even if rates stay at their current levels.
Turning to Slide 22. As I just indicated, our business plan uses a $1.60 as the budgeted rate for open positions. While this rate is higher than the current spot rate, we believe it is indicative of a longer-term exchange rate based on historical data. First, the 5-year average GBP rate was a $1.59, and the 10, 15, 20-year averages were all above $1.65.
Over the last 3 years when the exchange rate dip below at $1.50, it was short lived as seen by the blue line. In the last 20 years, only 20 days went below $1.40. And about 90% of the time, the exchange rate was $1.50 or higher. Similar to the commodity hedge program we use to hedge our supply business, our foreign currency hedging program sets ranges as guidelines that provides flexibility to take advantage of periods of pound strengthening, as we did earlier in 2014 by increasing our hedge levels for 2015 and '16 and does not require us to fully hedge our exposure at lower levels.
As you are aware, we have been very successful with this strategy on the commodity side of our business. And as I detailed, this strategy has positioned us well for 2015 and '16. I know that was a lot, but that concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

As well as the fact that we're into a -- entering into a full 8-year period upon which we have a great deal of certainty on the revenues and the cost side. So we think it's a great business. It fits well with our portfolio to the extent that we cannot overcome, maybe, questions or concerns that investors have, we'd obviously, as you point out, want to try to engage in activities that would either highlight that value or reweight the portfolio.

We're pleased that you're joining us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our 4 business segments.Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning",2198,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you're joining us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our 4 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2014 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials, and we'll talk about the recent movement of the pound sterling, and then, we're going to take your questions.
On a number of fronts, 2014 was another very successful year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results in our regulated utility segments and a competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite the continued challenging market conditions. And we made significant progress towards the spinoff of our supply business, which is designed to unlock significant value for our shareowners. The continued excellent performance of our utility, operations and our ongoing infrastructure investments in those companies together with the successful restructuring of our corporate support functions, give us confidence in PPL's ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the spinoff of the supply business.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2014 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.85 from our 2013 results. Adjusting for special items, our 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, matching the level that we achieved in 2013, despite significantly lower hedged power prices in our supply business. I'm very pleased, we're able to match our 2013 ongoing earnings per share this year with a solid financial performance of our regulated utilities, primarily in Pennsylvania and the U.K., offsetting the $0.10 decline we saw in supply.
For the fourth quarter, reported earnings were $1.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $0.60 in 2013. For the year, our utility operations in United States and the United Kingdom improved earnings from ongoing operations by combined $116 million or 8.5%. The primary drivers for this impressive performance are returns on additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania, higher returns as a result of power plant environmental projects in Kentucky and higher utility revenues resulting from U.K. price increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 4 -- 5 rather for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. As we said in our news release this morning, going forward, we're excluding from our forecast any earnings from our supply business and the net cost associated with the supply spinoff. We believe this approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the ongoing portfolio of PPL. As we previously communicated, we're restricted in providing supply or Talen forecast while in registration with the SEC. We appreciate everyone's patience during this process, I know that Paul and his team are very excited to communicate the full Talen story, which will occur as soon as possible following the spin. We provided an update to PPL Energy Supply's hedge profile in the appendix of today's presentation material, consistent with our prior practice.
Our 2015 forecast range for earnings from our regulated utility operations is $2.05 to $2.25 per share, unchanged from what we provided with our June announcement of the Talen transaction. The midpoint of this range is $2.15, which is 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removed supply earnings and includes the full impact of  dissynergies related to the spinoff of supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.
As I mentioned earlier, the excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the supply spinoff. The slide shows that we're anticipating slight increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. This slide also shows a significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as the result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time of the announcement. In addition to the Talen spinoff, 2015 is a transitional year for PPL in many other ways. In the U.K., we're moving to the RIIO regulatory construct, and we are in rate cases in Kentucky and expect to file a rate case during the year in Pennsylvania as well.
Growth in earnings in 2015 comes largely from the corporate restructuring efforts, but growth beyond 2015 will be driven by our utility companies.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Regulated operations. We're very pleased to note that WPD was recently named Utility of the Year by the international edition of Utility Week. This marks back-to-back years that PPL companies were named Utility of the Year. In judging WPD as the winner, a panel of industry experts scrutinized the business performance in terms of customer satisfaction, stakeholder return, sustainability and corporate social responsibility, staff development and stakeholder relationship. We congratulate the employees of WPD for this impressive achievement, and this recognition underscores the value we see in our U.K. business, as a key component of the portfolio going forward. Back in the U.S., progress is continuing on our rate cases in Kentucky. As we told you in November, we've requested increases in annual base electric rates of $30 million and $150 million at LG&E and KU, respectively, and an increase in annual base gas rates of $14 million at LG&E. The increases are principally driven by investments in generation supply and other infrastructure investments needed to maintain and enhance the safe and reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers and to meet federal environmental regulations. We anticipate that the new rates will go into effect on July 1st of this year. A timeline for the rate case consideration is included in today's appendix.
In 2014, we also continued to focus on major capital projects in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with capital spending for the domestic utilities of approximately $2.3 billion during the year. In Pennsylvania, nearly $350 million was spent on our 2 largest transmission projects, Susquehanna-Roseland and the Northeast/Pocono projects, which are now 95% and 60% complete, respectively. $140 million was spent on disk projects improving the reliability of our distribution system, while earning a near real time return. In Kentucky, some key construction achievements were reached as new environmental systems were completed in 2014 for 2 of the units at our KU gen station, and for 1 of the units at our LG&E Mill Creek station. The gen landfill and ash tranport system also became operational during the year. Construction of our new Kentucky combined cycle gas unit Cane Run 7 is on schedule with commercial operation in the unit estimated to begin by the end of May this year.
Turning to Slide 7. Let's briefly discuss domestic weather-normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the year were essentially flat with lower residential and commercial sales being offset by continued strong industrial sector growth. Industrial sector growth is driven by solid production levels being maintained by several of our large manufacturing customers amid improving economic conditions. Fourth quarter sales in Kentucky were lower because of the decline in residential and commercial sales, that was somewhat offset by industrial growth. The residential and commercial downturn is attributable to the continued slow growth or decline in several rural parts of Kentucky and Virginia.
As you can see, sales increased slightly in Pennsylvania in 2014, with the industrial category showing the strongest growth. The industrial sales growth is occurring, primarily, in the cement, metal and steel sectors. Pennsylvania weather-normalized sales in the fourth quarter showed slightly higher commercial sector use than was the case last year. That increase resulted from a higher customer count this year, as a result of improving economic conditions.
Moving to Slide 8. Looking back on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments at the Supply segment. In November, we completed the sale of the Montana Hydro electro facilities to NorthWestern Energy for about $900 million. As a reminder, these cash proceeds remain with PPL following the spin, and we expect to use them to fund utility infrastructure investments and pay down holding company debt in Kentucky this year. Looking into overall portfolio performance, we executed very well in 2014, outperforming our initial margin projections due to expanded spark spreads, fleet optimization and availability during peak load periods and our strategic hedging program that captured incremental value even when our units were uneconomic to dispatch.
You can see from the chart in the appendix on Slide 28 that we experienced some coal-to-gas switching this year, as low gas prices enabled our combined cycle gas units to continue to run like baseload units. Further we see market reforms, such as PGM's proposed capacity performance product, the shift in the variable resource requirement curve and a recent increase in the offer cap, as constructive signals supporting the competitive power business in PGM for the future.
Next, I'd like to talk about our significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business, which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. Last week, we submitted a response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, accepting their proposed mitigation plan to address potential market power issues in the mid-Atlantic region. The approval process is moving ahead as expected with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and we continue to anticipate approvals within our original projected timelines. The Talen Energy transition team headed by Paul Farr, President of PPL Energy Supply, has completed its staffing plan and continues to work towards their targeted synergies. We expect to close the Talen transaction in the second quarter of 2015.
Before we move on to Vince, I'll briefly provide you with an overview of our key objectives for 2015, which you'll see on Slide 9. Our primary objective, obviously, for this year is the completion of the energy supply spinoff. In the U.K., our folks are focused on executing the new business plan that was accepted as part of the RIIO-ED1 process, which begins April 1st of this year. In Kentucky, as mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with the efforts on our rate cases, and in Pennsylvania, while we don't yet have details on our filing, we do expect to file a distribution base case during the year.
In Kentucky, the major focus continues to be the execution of our generation and environmental construction projects, which are on schedule and on budget. In Pennsylvania, we're also focused on executing the large capital expenditure plan to continue to strengthen both our transmission and distribution systems.
And finally, we're very focused on implementing the corporate restructuring currently underway. We're confident that 2015 will be another solid year for PPL, as our employees implement our business plans to provide excellent service to customers and to continue to invest in infrastructure improvements. I'd like to take this opportunity to say that PPL employees have done an excellent job in designing and implementing a transition process that will launch a strong and streamlined corporate structure for the new PPL as well as set Talen Energy on course to operate safely and efficiently on Day 1. 2014 was, obviously, an eventful year for PPL, one in which we began to blaze new paths in growing value for our shareowners, even while we continue to provide the highest quality of service to our customers.
Our high-level performance during this challenging year further strengthens my confidence that both PPL and Talen Energy will be very successful companies for years to come. PPL has a strong record of strategic and financial execution. As we enter a new phase of our evolution, we're confident that we will continue to provide shareowners with competitive returns and our customers with best-in-class reliability and service at reasonable cost. As a pure play electric utility going forward, we believe our 3 regulatory jurisdictions provide predictable earnings opportunities with timely recovery of investments.
Our Transmission business has grown rapidly, and we continue to identify additional projects that will drive further growth in that part of the business. We expect the Transmission business to be the fastest growing part of our business for the foreseeable future. Finally, despite the recent decline in the British pound, we're confident in our ability to achieve an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%, given our current hedge levels and long track record of successful hedging programs that have helped drive our ability to meet or exceed earnings expectations. I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?"
185508,282841209,756316,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partial",2478,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partially offset by higher earnings from the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. Full year 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were the same as last year, both at $2.45 per share. Higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments were offset by lower earnings from the Supply segment and Corporate and Other. The $0.03 reduction in Corporate and Other is, primarily driven by tax-related items and higher financing and other costs.
Let's move to a more detailed review of 2014 segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned a $1.37 per share in 2014, a $0.05 increase compared to 2013. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M due to lower pension expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes due to an increase in 2014 taxable dividends and from a 2013 positive adjustment related to an IRS ruling on our earnings to profits calculation. We also had higher depreciation from assets placement service and other of $0.03 per share.
One other item of note for the U.K. Regulated segment in an attempt to provide you with additional visibility and transparency into the U.K. business, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC. PPL Global is, primarily, the U.K. Regulated segment, exclusive of the after-tax effect of allocated interest from the debt issued at PPL cap funding for the Midlands acquisition. We'll footnote those amounts, so you can reconcile the PPL Global LLC results to the results of the U.K. Regulated segment presented here today. We hope you'll find this additional disclosure useful. We're still assessing the format in which to provide this information, which we expect to furnish separately in an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.47 per share in 2014, a $0.01 decrease from 2013. This decrease was due to higher O&M, driven predominantly by timing of generation maintenance outages, storm-related expenses and higher uncollectible accounts. Higher depreciation from assets placed in service, higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx and other of $0.03 per share. This decrease in earnings was almost fully offset by higher gross margins from returns on environmental capital investment and higher sales volume due to favorable weather. The other variances of negative $0.03 for both the Kentucky and U.K. Regulated segments is related to the way we compute diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method of accounting for the debt component of the equity units. Not to get too technical, but the interest add back to net income in 2013 was higher than the add back in 2014. And with no change in the number of shares outstanding, this has the effect of reducing EPS this year compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.40 per share in 2014, a $0.09 increase over 2013. This increase was due to higher delivery margins in both transmission and distribution from higher returns on additional capital investments and lower O&M. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions and higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx.
Finishing our segment review with supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.29 per share in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of $0.10 per share. This decrease was, primarily, due to lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by favorable baseload asset performance, gains on certain commodity positions and the net benefits of unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. Lower margins were partially offset by lower financing costs, primarily, due to the repayment of the lower Mount Bethel debt in December of 2013, when we exited a lease and acquired that plant, and lower income taxes driven by truing up our state effective tax rate at year end 2014, and a valuation allowance adjustment recorded in 2013 related to deferred tax assets for state net operating losses.
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 ongoing earnings of $2.45 to our 2014 adjusted utility earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03, which adjust for the Supply segment and are related to synergies from the spin, as Bill described. This adjusted 2014 earnings amount is the starting point from which we are basing our 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate.
Starting from $2.45, we removed the current year Supply earnings of $0.29. We then adjusted for the $0.07 of O&M dissynergies, previously disclosed. This is the $75 million of indirect corporate costs that were allocated to Supply, but do not go with Supply as part of the spinoff. As we've discussed, corporate restructuring effort currently underway is intended to eliminate this dissynergy. We also adjusted for the $0.05 of interest on the $880 million of debt at PPL cap funding that was previously allocated to Supply, but will remain with PPL Corp. This is a permanent dissynergy. 
Finally, we adjusted the depreciation dissynergy down from $0.03 previously disclosed to $0.01, since by the time we get to 2017, there is only $0.01 of depreciation dissynergy remaining, as these assets are generally IT systems that have short useful lives, and some of the assets become fully depreciated over this time period.
Turning to Slide 16. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 adjusted regulated utility ongoing earnings of $2.03 to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2015 ongoing Regulated Utility forecast. Corporate and Other is forecasted to contribute $0.11 to the improvement in the 2015 earnings. As we implement the corporate restructuring, we expect to reduce the O&M dissynergies of $0.07. And in 2014, we incurred about $0.02 of deferred tax asset adjustments that we do not expect to incur in 2015. 
In the U.K., as discussed previously, utility revenues will decrease by about $0.14, primarily, due to revenue profiling and a lower weighted average cost of capital, partially offset by inflation and other items, as we move into the RIIO-ED1 price control period beginning April 1 of this year. Offsetting lower revenues, our lower U.S. income tax is as a result of the decrease in taxable dividends and a higher British pound exchange rate for 2015, as a result of our hedging program. The hedged rate for 2015 is about $1.63 compared to a realized hedge rate of $1.60 in 2014.
In Kentucky, we anticipate a slight increase in earnings with rate increases effective July 1. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by increases in O&M, due to higher pension and other labor related cost, higher depreciation on the increase plan and [ph] service, and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky. In Pennsylvania, we expect lower earnings in 2015, due primarily to higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. These negative drivers are expected to be partially offset by improved margins driven by increased transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital investments.
On Slide 17. We provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. Actual 2014 free cash flow before dividends was in line with the projection we provided last February, which if you recall included the proceeds from the sale of the Montana Hydro facilities. Looking at 2015, we are projecting a decrease in our free cash flow, primarily, driven by the $900 million Montana Hydro sale proceeds that we received in 2014, and the free cash flows of energy supply that are included in 2014 of about $200 million. 2015 cash from operations and capital expenditures exclude the Supply segment, except for $191 million of distributions to be received by court at the end of the first quarter with no additional distributions from supply thereafter.
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015 through 2019 are detailed on this slide, with Regulated Utility investment totaling almost $18 billion over that period. This includes previously announced initiatives, such as U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations as well as focusing on system reliability and generation capacity replacement with the retirement of some of our coal fleet in Kentucky, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. Our revised capital plan reflects incremental investment of approximately $900 million in Pennsylvania through 2018, including $500 million per transmission investments, including line rebuilds, new substations and substation security, and $200 million for distribution improvements, the smart meter replacement program and upgrades to our facilities. Most of the increased distribution spend is recoverable through rate mechanisms, including the disk and the smart meter rider. The revised plan also includes an increase of over $270 million from 2015 to 2018 in Kentucky environmental spending due to increases in scope to meet effluent water guidelines and other projects related to coal combustion residuals, including ash pond closures. This increase partially offsets the net reduction of about $600 million of spend from 2015 to '18 from the deferral of the Green River 5 CCGT plan.
And finally, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.
Turning to Slide 19. Our updated investment plan drives a CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base to 2019, driving value for both our customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are targeting to achieve compound annual growth in earnings per share of 4% to 6% through at least 2017. At this time, I'll highlight certain key assumptions used for each segment, that supports the 4% to 6% earnings CAGR. For the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, assumptions contributing to this growth include the successful -- excuse me, execution of our capital plan for both transmission and distribution. Earnings growth through 2017 is based on transmission CapEx spend of $2.1 billion and distribution CapEx spend of $1.2 billion, with disk and smart meter CapEx contributing $530 million and $160 million, respectively. The successful distribution base rate case plan for 2015 with new rates effective in early 2016, and we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the Kentucky Regulated segment, key assumptions include the successful execution of our environmental CapEx program of $1.3 billion and the completion of the Cane Run combined cycle natural gas-fired plant. Successful completion of the current base rate cases with new rates effective July 1, 2015, and once again, we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides 8 years of base revenue certainty, continued opportunity to outperform targets and the ability to true up certain costs, such as the annual change in the cost of debt and inflation, as determined by the U.K. RPI. We have also assumed a budgeted currency rate of $1.60 per GBP. And for RPI under the Ofgem methodology, the forecasted inflation rate used for the '15, '16 regulatory year is 2.6%, which will be trued up for the actual realized inflation in the '17-'18 regulatory year. Our long range RPI assumption beyond '15-'16 is 3%. Incentive revenues are soon to be slightly higher for the 2014-15 regulatory year compared to the $125 million we earned for the regulatory year ended in March 2014. We assume incentive revenues decline from there, given the type of performance targets under RIIO-ED1.
For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve this level of savings. We also assume equity issuances of $200 million annually, which is an increase of $100 million per year from our prior disclosure. This increase is to help fund the additional CapEx in the plan, while maintaining our strong credit metrics.
Moving to Slide 21. We know many of you have been focused on the recent movement in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate and would like to understand the effect it has on our earnings from WPD. The next couple of slides present information on our hedge levels and provide details that help us set a budgeted rate of $1.60 per GBP. On this slide, we detail our hedging status for 2015 and 2016, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. First, we are nearly fully hedged at 97% for 2015, at an average rate of $1.63.
For 2016, we are 70% hedged at an average rate of $1.61. Since our third quarter update, we have layered on additional hedges for 2016 using collars to help protect against a further decline, but preserve some upside should the GBP strengthen from its current position. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure in 2015, given our 97% hedge level and minimal exposure in 2016, even if rates stay at their current levels.
Turning to Slide 22. As I just indicated, our business plan uses $1.60 as the budgeted rate for our open positions. While this rate is higher than the current spot rate, we believe it is indicative of a longer-term exchange rate based on historical data. First, the 5-year average GBP rate was a $1.59, and the 10, 15, and 20-year averages were all above $1.65.
Over the last 3 years when the exchange rate dipped below at $1.50, it was short-lived as seen by the blue line. In the last 20 years, only 20 days went below $1.40. And about 90% of the time, the exchange rate was $1.50 or higher. Similar to the commodity hedge program we use to hedge our supply business, our foreign currency hedging program sets ranges as guidelines that provide flexibility to take advantage of periods of GBP strengthening, as we did earlier in 2014 by increasing our hedge levels for 2015 and '16 and does not require us to fully hedge our exposure at lower levels.
As you are aware, we have been very successful with this strategy on the commodity side of our business. And as I detailed, this strategy has positioned us well for 2015 and '16. I know that was a lot, but that concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

We're also doing some extra investment in the distribution space, talked about the smart meter plan. We're doing a lot of things, smart grid related smart switches, what we call tielines, which basically ties circuits together which further enable smart grids. So those are the principal components of the additional investment."

As well as the fact that we're into a -- entering into a full 8-year period upon which we have a great deal of certainty on the revenues and the cost side. So we think it's a great business. It fits well with our portfolio. To the extent that we cannot overcome, maybe, questions or concerns that investors have, we'd obviously, as you point out, want to try to engage in activities that would either highlight that value or reweight the portfolio. But at this point, I don't think there is a need or desire to do any of that.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our 4 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2014 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials, and we'll talk about the recent movement of the pound sterling, and then, we're going to take your questions.
On a number of fronts, 2014 was another very successful year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results in our regulated utility segments and a competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite the continued challenging market conditions. And we made significant progress towards the spinoff of our supply business, which is designed to unlock significant value for our shareowners. The continued excellent performance of our utility, operations and our ongoing infrastructure investments in those companies together with the successful restructuring of our corporate support functions, give us confidence in PPL's ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the spinoff of the supply business.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2014 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.85 from our 2013 results. Adjusting for special items, our 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, matching the level that we achieved in 2013, despite significantly lower hedged power prices in our supply business. I'm very pleased, we're able to match our 2013 ongoing earnings per share this year with a solid financial performance of our regulated utilities, primarily in Pennsylvania and the U.K., offsetting the $0.10 decline we saw in supply.
For the fourth quarter, reported earnings were $1.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $0.60 in 2013. For the year, our utility operations in United States and the United Kingdom improved earnings from ongoing operations by combined $116 million or 8.5%. The primary drivers for this impressive performance are returns on additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania, higher returns as a result of power plant environmental projects in Kentucky and higher utility revenues resulting from U.K. price increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 4 -- 5 rather for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. As we said in our news release this morning, going forward, we're excluding from our forecast any earnings from our supply business and the net cost associated with the supply spinoff. We believe this approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the ongoing portfolio of PPL. As we previously communicated, we're restricted in providing supply or Talen forecast while in registration with the SEC. We appreciate everyone's patience during this process, I know that Paul and his team are very excited to communicate the full Talen story, which will occur as soon as possible following the spin. We provided an update to PPL Energy Supply's hedge profile in the appendix of today's presentation material, consistent with our prior practice.
Our 2015 forecast range for earnings from our regulated utility operations is $2.05 to $2.25 per share, unchanged from what we provided with our June announcement of the Talen transaction. The midpoint of this range is $2.15, which is 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removed supply earnings and includes the full impact of dissynergies related to the spinoff of supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.
As I mentioned earlier, the excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the supply spinoff. The slide shows that we're anticipating slight increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. This slide also shows a significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as the result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time of the announcement. In addition to the Talen spinoff, 2015 is a transitional year for PPL in many other ways. In the U.K., we're moving to the RIIO regulatory construct, and we are in rate cases in Kentucky and expect to file a rate case during the year in Pennsylvania as well.
Growth in earnings in 2015 comes largely from the corporate restructuring efforts, but growth beyond 2015 will be driven by our utility companies.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Regulated operations. We're very pleased to note that WPD was recently named Utility of the Year by the international edition of Utility Week. This marks back-to-back years that PPL companies were named Utility of the Year. In judging WPD as the winner, a panel of industry experts scrutinized the business performance in terms of customer satisfaction, stakeholder return, sustainability and corporate social responsibility, staff development and stakeholder relationship. We congratulate the employees of WPD for this impressive achievement, and this recognition underscores the value we see in our U.K. business, as a key component of the portfolio going forward. Back in the U.S., progress is continuing on our rate cases in Kentucky. As we told you in November, we've requested increases in annual base electric rates of $30 million and $150 million at LG&E and KU, respectively, and an increase in annual base gas rates of $14 million at LG&E. The increases are principally driven by investments in generation supply and other infrastructure investments needed to maintain and enhance the safe and reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers and to meet federal environmental regulations. We anticipate that the new rates will go into effect on July 1st of this year. A timeline for the rate case consideration is included in today's appendix.
In 2014, we also continued to focus on major capital projects in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with capital spending for the domestic utilities of approximately $2.3 billion during the year. In Pennsylvania, nearly $350 million was spent on our 2 largest transmission projects, Susquehanna-Roseland and the Northeast/Pocono projects, which are now 95% and 60% complete, respectively. $140 million was spent on disk projects improving the reliability of our distribution system, while earning a near real time return. In Kentucky, some key construction achievements were reached as new environmental systems were completed in 2014 for 2 of the units at our KU gen station, and for 1 of the units at our LG&E Mill Creek station. The gen landfill and ash transport system also became operational during the year. Construction of our new Kentucky combined cycle gas unit Cane Run 7 is on schedule with commercial operation in the unit estimated to begin by the end of May this year.
Turning to Slide 7. Let's briefly discuss domestic weather-normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the year were essentially flat with lower residential and commercial sales being offset by continued strong industrial sector growth. Industrial sector growth is driven by solid production levels being maintained by several of our large manufacturing customers amid improving economic conditions. Fourth quarter sales in Kentucky were lower because of the decline in residential and commercial sales, that was somewhat offset by industrial growth. The residential and commercial downturn is attributable to the continued slow growth or decline in several rural parts of Kentucky and Virginia.
As you can see, sales increased slightly in Pennsylvania in 2014, with the industrial category showing the strongest growth. The industrial sales growth is occurring, primarily, in the cement, metal and steel sectors. Pennsylvania weather-normalized sales in the fourth quarter showed slightly higher commercial sector use than was the case last year. That increase resulted from a higher customer count this year, as a result of improving economic conditions.
Moving to Slide 8. Looking back on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments at the Supply segment. In November, we completed the sale of the Montana Hydro electro facilities to NorthWestern Energy for about $900 million. As a reminder, these cash proceeds remain with PPL following the spin, and we expect to use them to fund utility infrastructure investments and pay down holding company debt in Kentucky this year. Looking into overall portfolio performance, we executed very well in 2014, outperforming our initial margin projections due to expanded spark spreads, fleet optimization and availability during peak load periods and our strategic hedging program that captured incremental value even when our units were uneconomic to dispatch.
You can see from the chart in the appendix on Slide 28 that we experienced some coal-to-gas switching this year, as low gas prices enabled our combined cycle gas units to continue to run like baseload units. Further we see market reforms, such as PGM's proposed capacity performance product, the shift in the variable resource requirement curve and a recent increase in the offer cap, as constructive signals supporting the competitive power business in PGM for the future.
Next, I'd like to talk about our significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business, which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. Last week, we submitted a response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, accepting their proposed mitigation plan to address potential market power issues in the mid-Atlantic region. The approval process is moving ahead as expected with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and we continue to anticipate approvals within our original projected timelines. The Talen Energy transition team headed by Paul Farr, President of PPL Energy Supply, has completed its staffing plan and continues to work towards their targeted synergies. We expect to close the Talen transaction in the second quarter of 2015.
Before we move on to Vince, I'll briefly provide you with an overview of our key objectives for 2015, which you'll see on Slide 9. Our primary objective, obviously, for this year is the completion of the energy supply spinoff. In the U.K., our folks are focused on executing the new business plan that was accepted as part of the RIIO-ED1 process, which begins April 1st of this year. In Kentucky, as mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with the efforts on our rate cases, and in Pennsylvania, while we don't yet have details on our filing, we do expect to file a distribution base case during the year.
In Kentucky, the major focus continues to be the execution of our generation and environmental construction projects, which are on schedule and on budget. In Pennsylvania, we're also focused on executing the large capital expenditure plan to continue to strengthen both our transmission and distribution systems.
And finally, we're very focused on implementing the corporate restructuring currently underway. We're confident that 2015 will be another solid year for PPL, as our employees implement our business plans to provide excellent service to customers and to continue to invest in infrastructure improvements. I'd like to take this opportunity to say that PPL employees have done an excellent job in designing and implementing a transition process that will launch a strong and streamlined corporate structure for the new PPL as well as set Talen Energy on course to operate safely and efficiently on Day 1. 2014 was, obviously, an eventful year for PPL, one in which we began to blaze new paths in growing value for our shareowners, even while we continue to provide the highest quality of service to our customers.
Our high-level performance during this challenging year further strengthens my confidence that both PPL and Talen Energy will be very successful companies for years to come. PPL has a strong record of strategic and financial execution. As we enter a new phase of our evolution, we're confident that we will continue to provide shareowners with competitive returns and our customers with best-in-class reliability and service at reasonable cost. As a pure play electric utility going forward, we believe our 3 regulatory jurisdictions provide predictable earnings opportunities with timely recovery of investments.
Our Transmission business has grown rapidly, and we continue to identify additional projects that will drive further growth in that part of the business. We expect the Transmission business to be the fastest growing part of our business for the foreseeable future. Finally, despite the recent decline in the British pound, we're confident in our ability to achieve an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%, given our current hedge levels and long track record of successful hedging programs that have helped drive our ability to meet or exceed earnings expectations. I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partial",2478,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partially offset by higher earnings from the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. Full year 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were the same as last year, both at $2.45 per share. Higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments were offset by lower earnings from the Supply segment and Corporate and Other. The $0.03 reduction in Corporate and Other is, primarily driven by tax-related items and higher financing and other costs.
Let's move to a more detailed review of 2014 segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned a $1.37 per share in 2014, a $0.05 increase compared to 2013. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M due to lower pension expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes due to an increase in 2014 taxable dividends and from a 2013 positive adjustment related to an IRS ruling on our earnings to profits calculation. We also had higher depreciation from assets placement service and other of $0.03 per share.
One other item of note for the U.K. Regulated segment in an attempt to provide you with additional visibility and transparency into the U.K. business, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC. PPL Global is, primarily, the U.K. Regulated segment, exclusive of the after-tax effect of allocated interest from the debt issued at PPL cap funding for the Midlands acquisition. We'll footnote those amounts, so you can reconcile the PPL Global LLC results to the results of the U.K. Regulated segment presented here today. We hope you'll find this additional disclosure useful. We're still assessing the format in which to provide this information, which we expect to furnish separately in an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.47 per share in 2014, a $0.01 decrease from 2013. This decrease was due to higher O&M, driven predominantly by timing of generation maintenance outages, storm-related expenses and higher uncollectible accounts. Higher depreciation from assets placed in service, higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx and other of $0.03 per share. This decrease in earnings was almost fully offset by higher gross margins from returns on environmental capital investment and higher sales volume due to favorable weather. The other variances of negative $0.03 for both the Kentucky and U.K. Regulated segments is related to the way we compute diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method of accounting for the debt component of the equity units. Not to get too technical, but the interest add back to net income in 2013 was higher than the add back in 2014. And with no change in the number of shares outstanding, this has the effect of reducing EPS this year compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.40 per share in 2014, a $0.09 increase over 2013. This increase was due to higher delivery margins in both transmission and distribution from higher returns on additional capital investments and lower O&M. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions and higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx.
Finishing our segment review with supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.29 per share in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of $0.10 per share. This decrease was, primarily, due to lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by favorable baseload asset performance, gains on certain commodity positions and the net benefits of unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. Lower margins were partially offset by lower financing costs, primarily, due to the repayment of the lower Mount Bethel debt in December of 2013, when we exited a lease and acquired that plant, and lower income taxes driven by truing up our state effective tax rate at year end 2014, and a valuation allowance adjustment recorded in 2013 related to deferred tax assets for state net operating losses.
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 ongoing earnings of $2.45 to our 2014 adjusted utility earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03, which adjust for the Supply segment and are related to synergies from the spin, as Bill described. This adjusted 2014 earnings amount is the starting point from which we are basing our 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate.
Starting from $2.45, we removed the current year Supply earnings of $0.29. We then adjusted for the $0.07 of O&M dissynergies, previously disclosed. This is the $75 million of indirect corporate costs that were allocated to Supply, but do not go with Supply as part of the spinoff. As we've discussed, corporate restructuring effort currently underway is intended to eliminate this dissynergy. We also adjusted for the $0.05 of interest on the $880 million of debt at PPL cap funding that was previously allocated to Supply, but will remain with PPL Corp. This is a permanent dissynergy. 
Finally, we adjusted the depreciation dissynergy down from $0.03 previously disclosed to $0.01, since by the time we get to 2017, there is only $0.01 of depreciation dissynergy remaining, as these assets are generally IT systems that have short useful lives, and some of the assets become fully depreciated over this time period.
Turning to Slide 16. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 adjusted regulated utility ongoing earnings of $2.03 to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2015 ongoing Regulated Utility forecast. Corporate and Other is forecasted to contribute $0.11 to the improvement in the 2015 earnings. As we implement the corporate restructuring, we expect to reduce the O&M dissynergies of $0.07. And in 2014, we incurred about $0.02 of deferred tax asset adjustments that we do not expect to incur in 2015. 
In the U.K., as discussed previously, utility revenues will decrease by about $0.14, primarily, due to revenue profiling and a lower weighted average cost of capital, partially offset by inflation and other items, as we move into the RIIO-ED1 price control period beginning April 1 of this year. Offsetting lower revenues, our lower U.S. income tax is as a result of the decrease in taxable dividends and a higher British pound exchange rate for 2015, as a result of our hedging program. The hedged rate for 2015 is about $1.63 compared to a realized hedge rate of $1.60 in 2014.
In Kentucky, we anticipate a slight increase in earnings with rate increases effective July 1. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by increases in O&M, due to higher pension and other labor related cost, higher depreciation on the increase plan and [ph] service, and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky. In Pennsylvania, we expect lower earnings in 2015, due primarily to higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. These negative drivers are expected to be partially offset by improved margins driven by increased transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital investments.
On Slide 17. We provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. Actual 2014 free cash flow before dividends was in line with the projection we provided last February, which if you recall included the proceeds from the sale of the Montana Hydro facilities. Looking at 2015, we are projecting a decrease in our free cash flow, primarily, driven by the $900 million Montana Hydro sale proceeds that we received in 2014, and the free cash flows of energy supply that are included in 2014 of about $200 million. 2015 cash from operations and capital expenditures exclude the Supply segment, except for $191 million of distributions to be received by court at the end of the first quarter with no additional distributions from supply thereafter.
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015 through 2019 are detailed on this slide, with Regulated Utility investment totaling almost $18 billion over that period. This includes previously announced initiatives, such as U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations as well as focusing on system reliability and generation capacity replacement with the retirement of some of our coal fleet in Kentucky, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. Our revised capital plan reflects incremental investment of approximately $900 million in Pennsylvania through 2018, including $500 million per transmission investments, including line rebuilds, new substations and substation security, and $200 million for distribution improvements, the smart meter replacement program and upgrades to our facilities. Most of the increased distribution spend is recoverable through rate mechanisms, including the disk and the smart meter rider. The revised plan also includes an increase of over $270 million from 2015 to 2018 in Kentucky environmental spending due to increases in scope to meet effluent water guidelines and other projects related to coal combustion residuals, including ash pond closures. This increase partially offsets the net reduction of about $600 million of spend from 2015 to '18 from the deferral of the Green River 5 CCGT plan.
And finally, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.
Turning to Slide 19. Our updated investment plan drives a CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base to 2019, driving value for both our customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are targeting to achieve compound annual growth in earnings per share of 4% to 6% through at least 2017. At this time, I'll highlight certain key assumptions used for each segment, that supports the 4% to 6% earnings CAGR. For the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, assumptions contributing to this growth include the successful -- excuse me, execution of our capital plan for both transmission and distribution. Earnings growth through 2017 is based on transmission CapEx spend of $2.1 billion and distribution CapEx spend of $1.2 billion, with disk and smart meter CapEx contributing $530 million and $160 million, respectively. The successful distribution base rate case plan for 2015 with new rates effective in early 2016, and we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the Kentucky Regulated segment, key assumptions include the successful execution of our environmental CapEx program of $1.3 billion and the completion of the Cane Run combined cycle natural gas-fired plant. Successful completion of the current base rate cases with new rates effective July 1, 2015, and once again, we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.
For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides 8 years of base revenue certainty, continued opportunity to outperform targets and the ability to true up certain costs, such as the annual change in the cost of debt and inflation, as determined by the U.K. RPI. We have also assumed a budgeted currency rate of $1.60 per GBP. And for RPI under the Ofgem methodology, the forecasted inflation rate used for the '15, '16 regulatory year is 2.6%, which will be trued up for the actual realized inflation in the '17-'18 regulatory year. Our long range RPI assumption beyond '15-'16 is 3%. Incentive revenues are soon to be slightly higher for the 2014-15 regulatory year compared to the $125 million we earned for the regulatory year ended in March 2014. We assume incentive revenues decline from there, given the type of performance targets under RIIO-ED1.
For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve this level of savings. We also assume equity issuances of $200 million annually, which is an increase of $100 million per year from our prior disclosure. This increase is to help fund the additional CapEx in the plan, while maintaining our strong credit metrics.
Moving to Slide 21. We know many of you have been focused on the recent movement in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate and would like to understand the effect it has on our earnings from WPD. The next couple of slides present information on our hedge levels and provide details that help us set a budgeted rate of $1.60 per GBP. On this slide, we detail our hedging status for 2015 and 2016, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. First, we are nearly fully hedged at 97% for 2015, at an average rate of $1.63.
For 2016, we are 70% hedged at an average rate of $1.61. Since our third quarter update, we have layered on additional hedges for 2016 using collars to help protect against a further decline, but preserve some upside should the GBP strengthen from its current position. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure in 2015, given our 97% hedge level and minimal exposure in 2016, even if rates stay at their current levels.
Turning to Slide 22. As I just indicated, our business plan uses $1.60 as the budgeted rate for our open positions. While this rate is higher than the current spot rate, we believe it is indicative of a longer-term exchange rate based on historical data. First, the 5-year average GBP rate was a $1.59, and the 10, 15, and 20-year averages were all above $1.65.
Over the last 3 years when the exchange rate dipped below at $1.50, it was short-lived as seen by the blue line. In the last 20 years, only 20 days went below $1.40. And about 90% of the time, the exchange rate was $1.50 or higher. Similar to the commodity hedge program we use to hedge our supply business, our foreign currency hedging program sets ranges as guidelines that provide flexibility to take advantage of periods of GBP strengthening, as we did earlier in 2014 by increasing our hedge levels for 2015 and '16 and does not require us to fully hedge our exposure at lower levels.
As you are aware, we have been very successful with this strategy on the commodity side of our business. And as I detailed, this strategy has positioned us well for 2015 and '16. I know that was a lot, but that concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And as we go forward, we're also looking at other ways in which we can highlight to investors the real significant value that we believe exists in the U.K. business. And some of that value has, obviously, shown itself through our fast track that Rick just mentioned. As well as the fact that we're into a -- entering into a full 8-year period upon which we have a great deal of certainty on the revenues and the cost side. So we think it's a great business. It fits well with our portfolio. To the extent that we cannot overcome, maybe, questions or concerns that investors have, we'd obviously, as you point out, want to try to engage in activities that would either highlight that value or reweight the portfolio. But at this point, I don't think there is a need or desire to do any of that. And I would also mention that because our U.S. businesses are growing much faster than the U.K. business, over time the weighting is going to come down for the U.K., just through our organic growth in the U.S. So I think over time, we'll continue to highlight the value in the business and make sure it's appropriately valued and look at any opportunity we need to, to make sure that shareowners get that value out of it."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 first quarter earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials. He'll also provide an update on our U.K. operations, including our improved currency hedge status, a new look at our sensitivity changes in RPI or U.K. inflation, and our enhanced stability to repatriate cash. Then we will take your questions.
The first quarter of 2015 marked a successful start of the year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results overall with solid performance across our regulated utility businesses. The competitive Supply segment also turned in a solid performance despite ongoing challenging market conditions.
As I'll describe in more detail shortly, we're on track to complete the spin-off of Supply on June 1.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter of 2015 reported earnings of $0.96 per share, an increase of $0.47 from our first quarter 2014 results. Adjusting for special items are regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations of $0.77 per share, up 17% from first quarter 2014 adjusted regulated utility results.
If you recall from our 2014 year-end earnings call, we discussed, excluding the Supply segment earnings and net cost associated with the Supply spinoff from our ongoing earnings to provide results for our regulated utility operations. This approach provides our investors with a clear picture of the financial performance of the going forward part of our PPL portfolio.
Consistent with that approach, we've adjusted the ongoing earnings on this slide to focus on our regulated utility operations. With regards to regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations, I'm pleased with the increase we achieved in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago. Strong first quarter earnings at our U.K. regulated segment drove the 17% increase. Vince will provide more details on all the quarterly results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. Based on first quarter performance, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations. The mid-point of this range, $2.15 per share, is approximately 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations were moved supply earnings and includes the full impact of these synergies related to the spinoff of Supply, including an indirect O&M, interest and depreciation.
Based on the continued excellent performance of our utility operations, the organic growth from plans and approved infrastructure investments and the results of our corporate restructuring efforts, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 4% to 6% to at least 2017.
As shown here on Slide 5, for 2015, we're anticipating small increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities, and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. The slide also shows the significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as a result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of these synergies we discussed at the time we announced the spinoff. At the outset of the year, I mentioned that 2015 is very much a transitional year for PPL.
On April 1, our U.K. regulated segment transitioned to the new RIIO-ED1 8-year price control period. On June 1, the spinoff of our Supply business and creation of Talen Energy will be completed. In Kentucky, we expect our rate case to be concluded in the second quarter, with new rates taking effect July 1. And in Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in late March, and we're working through the public utility commission's review process. All these 2015 initiatives are on track and we're really pleased with the progress thus far.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Kentucky regulated operations. We continue to make progress on our Kentucky rate proceedings, reaching a settlement agreement in April, with all the parties in the base rate cases before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. If the settlement is approved by the commission, it will result in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at movable gas and electric. The settlement focuses on the total amount of cost we can recover, rather than establishing a return on equity with respect to base rates. While the settlement did not establish an ROE for base rates, we will earn a 10% return on equity investment related to the environmental cost recovery mechanism and our guest line tracker mechanism. The settlement agreement also provides for deferred cost recovery on a portion of the cost associated with pensions and Kentucky Utility's Green River plant, which is scheduled to be retired in April of 2016. We are pleased to reach a unanimous settlement with the case. As I mentioned, we anticipate that new rates will go into effect on July 1 of this year. 
We also continue to focus on major capital projects in Kentucky. Recent milestones include the retirement of our Cane Run unit 6 coal-fired generating unit, the first of 3 units that are being retired at that facility. The retirement comes as the company prepares its new Cane Run 7 combined cycle gas-fired unit online later this quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. On March 31, we filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public utility commission for an increase of $167.5 million in annual distribution revenue requirement at PPL electric utilities. This request is driven by investments we're making to our new, strengthened and modernized Pennsylvania delivery network. If approved by the PUC, we expect the increase to take effect January 1 of 2016. We're also set to energize the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in just a few days. This $630 million project represents a major upgrade to the nation's electric grid. The new 500kv powerline will strengthen reliability for millions of people in the Northeast. The 3-year project created significant economic development benefits in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including the creation of about 2,000 construction jobs. This project was 1 of 7 projects nationwide to be fast tracked by the Obama administration's Rapid Response Team, recognizing its importance.
Building a major transmission line like this requires a tremendous amount of planning, communication and cooperation with many different stakeholders, including government agencies, PSEG, our neighboring utility who partnered with us on the construction of the line, local officials and the company. Many people are involved in making this project a success. I appreciate their dedication and the achievement. This project is a great example of our ability to execute major capital projects that adds value for both customers and shareowners.
Turning to Slide 8, let's briefly discuss domestic weather normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather normalized sales for the first quarter were down about 0.5% with residential, commercial and industrial usage lower compared to year ago. Kentucky experienced lower sales volumes due to a longer period of cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2015 as well as more extreme weather last year compared to this year. As you can see, first quarter weather normalized 2015 sales were also lower in Pennsylvania than in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven by lower residential and industrial sales, offset slightly by higher commercial sales.
The 2015 weather normalized sales are 1.2% below 2014. Similar to Kentucky, weather normalized sales comparisons to 2014 are difficult due to extreme weather impacts. Although the winter of 2015 was slightly colder than the winter of 2014, 2014's polar vortex was much more volatile with more temperature swings. On a rolling 12-month basis, total weather normalized sales in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania were essentially flat for the 12 months ending March 31, 2015, compared to the previous 12-month period.
Moving to Slide 9. We continue to make significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. We've now received all the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the transaction, including from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility commission. We expect to close on the transaction, June 1.
Talen Energy common stock is expected to begin trading on a win issued basis on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLNWI, beginning on May 18. On June 2, regular weight trading of Talen Energy common stock will begin under the symbol TLN Immediately following the transaction, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy's outstanding common stock, with Riverstone affiliates owning the remaining 35%. The PPL Board of Directors have declared a pro rata distribution to PPL shareowners of record on May 20. The distribution ratio is expected to be approximately 0.125 Talen shares for each PPL share, and will take place in June 1. PPL will announce the definitive distribution ratio promptly after the record date, based on the actual number of PPL shares outstanding on that date. Our PPL and talent transition teams have done a great job of coordinating a transition process that will allow Talen Energy to operate safely and efficiently on day 1, and result in a lower cost corporate structure for PPL going forward.
Before turning the call over to Vince, I would reiterate that we had a solid start to 2015, and we were able to reach a settlement in the rate case in Kentucky. And as Vince is going to review shortly, PPL's got a strong foundation for future success as a pure play regulated utility company. PPL's taking significant steps, as many of you know, to preserve and create shareowners value over the last several years. As we approach June 1, which will consummate the formation of Talen Energy, I want to just take a moment to thank all of the PPL employees and future Talen employees that have made this significant effort possible. And for all the past contributions of our PPL Energy Supply employees. I'd also like to thank Paul Farr for his leadership, not only with the spin of the energy supply business, but also for the 7 years he spent as PPL's CFO. I appreciate all they've done and wish them much success.
I'll now ask Vince to provide an update on the first quarter segment results. Vince?"

As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment",1375,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Today, I will be comparing our regulated utility earnings results to our adjusted 2014 results. As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment and adjust for the synergies related to spend. These adjustments are consistent in approach with the full-year adjustments we made to our 2014 year-end results. I will discuss our Supply segment results separately.
Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. recollected segment and an improvement in corporate and other. While the Kentucky regulated and Pennsylvania regulated segments remain flat to a year ago. Although weather was flat for the domestic utilities compared to last year, it was better than normal by about $0.03.
And while earnings from ongoing operations in the U.K. increased significantly in the quarter compared to a year ago, we continue to expect earnings for this segment to be up only slightly on a full year basis. This was driven by lower utility revenues as we transition to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, offset by improvements in income taxes, depreciation expense and the effects of foreign currency. 
The increase in corporate and other earnings from ongoing operations was primarily due to the benefits of the corporate restructuring as we expected.
As we've mentioned, the corporate restructuring effort is well underway, and we are already beginning to see those benefits. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve the targeted $75 million in corporate support cost savings we discussed during our previous call. The Supply first quarter earnings from ongoing operations also remain the same as the first quarter 2014.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11.
Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in the first quarter 2015, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenue due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Lower depreciation expense, driven by the completion of a periodic useful life assessment of certain fixed assets, that resulted in an extension of our network assets lives, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to asset additions. Lower financing costs due to lower interest on our index link debt, favorable effects from foreign currency, and lower income taxes in other, from a lower U.K. taxes and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to less favorable weather compared to last year and higher income taxes.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the first quarter, also comparable to last year. This was primarily due to higher margins from additional transmission investments, partially offset by a benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 from a change in estimate of our regulatory liabilities. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Finishing our segment review with Supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2015, the same as a year ago despite the benefit of the unusual -- unusually cold weather we experienced in Q1 of last year. Excluding the $0.03 weather impact from 2014, the results were higher primarily due to higher energy prices, favorable base load generation and higher intermediate and peaking margins, offset by lower capacity prices, lower results from full requirement sales contracts and certain other commodity positions. We also had lower payroll costs and lower financing costs compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide, we detail our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. 
First, we continue to be hedged at 97% for the remainder of 2015 by an average rate of $1.60. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage slightly from 70% at year-end to 72% today, at an average rate of $1.61. We also started to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we are now 20% hedged to our 2017 at an average rate of $1.60.
You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure for the remainder of 2015, minimal exposure in 2016, and about $0.04 of exposure in 2017, if our average hedge rate is $1.65 and $0.07 of exposure if it's $1.50. Also on this slide, we are showing an RPI sensitivity. Under the real methodology, our revenues for the 2015, '16 year was set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in the 2017, '18 time period will reflect the true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015, '16 regulatory year.
Current RPI forecast using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest a 2015, '16 inflation rate of about 2% compared to the 2.6% included in our current revenues. Therefore, we are providing a sensitivity for 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015, '16 time period. RPI forecast for 2016 and beyond is are either at or above our assumed 3%. RPI affects 3 primary financial drivers for WPD, our revenue, our O&M and the interest expense on our index-linked debt. The lower RPI we are currently experiencing does not have a significant effect on our 2015 or 2016 U.K. earnings guidance we provided during our year-end call. 
For 2017, since this is the first we see the RPI true-up in revenues, the lower 2015, '16 RPI of 50 basis points or RPI of about 2% would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017.
Moving to Slide 16. We're providing an updated view of our cash repatriation ability in the U.K. Since our year-end update, we continue to evaluate our ability to repatriate cash from the U.K. We expect to increase our 2015 cash repatriation by about 10% over the information we provided on the year-end earnings call to about $300 million. We believe we have additional capacity beyond that, and for 2016 and 2017, we now forecast that we can bring up to $500 million per year. We are showing ranges here of $300 million to $500 million for 2016, '17 as we determine the amount based on a domestic cash needs at that time. We recognize that at $300 million of U.K. distributions per year, the domestic payout ratio to fund our dividend was over 100% beginning in 2016. With our ability to dividend between $300 million and $500 million a year from WPD over the next few years, we would target to get the domestic payout ratio back under 100% for 2016, and continue to lower that domestic payout ratio in 2017 and '18. We are confident we can fund the PPL dividend and continue to grow it modestly, while we're in this period of high CapEx spending.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I also want to provide an update on our expectations for bonus revenues in the U.K., since we received a lot of questions on this topic. As we enter the RIIO-ED1 price control period, we expect lower bonus revenues as our ability to outperform will be more challenging, given the tighter performance targets under RIIO, Rick has discussed this topic on our previous call. This will result in lower bonus revenues starting in 2017. Our business plan assumes $120 million of bonus revenues for 2015, between $120 million and $130 million for 2016, I between $80 million and $100 million for 2017. And for 2018, when the full impact of the tighter performance targets is seen, we would expect to earn between $60 million in $90 million in bonus revenues.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And so what we're able to do was basically reprice some of our 2015 in the money hedges, lower the strikes a little bit on those and that enabled us to basically get in the money hedges out in 2017. And so the impact of doing that is actually about a $0.02 hit to '15, but it enabled us to preserve about 20% of our hedge levels in '17 at our budgeted rate of $1.60."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 first quarter earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials. He'll also provide an update on our U.K. operations, including our improved currency hedge status, a new look at our sensitivity to changes in RPI or U.K. inflation, and our enhanced ability to repatriate cash. Then we will take your questions.
The first quarter of 2015 marked a successful start to the year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results, overall, with solid performance across our regulated utility businesses. The competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite ongoing challenging market conditions.
As I'll describe in more detail shortly, we're on track to complete the spin-off of Supply on June 1.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter of 2015 reported earnings of $0.96 per share, an increase of $0.47 from our first quarter 2014 results. Adjusting for special items, our regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations were $0.77 per share, up 17% from first quarter 2014 adjusted regulated utility results.
If you recall from our 2014 year-end earnings call, we discussed, excluding the Supply segment earnings and net costs associated with the Supply spin-off from our ongoing earnings to provide results for our regulated utility operations. This approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the forward -- going forward part of our PPL portfolio.
Consistent with that approach, we've adjusted the ongoing earnings on this slide to focus on our regulated utility operations. With regards to regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations, I'm pleased with the increase we achieved in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago. Strong first quarter earnings at our U.K. Regulated segment drove the 17% increase. Vince will provide more details on all the quarterly results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. Based on first quarter performance, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations. The mid-point of this range, $2.15 per share, is approximately 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removes Supply earnings and includes the full impact of dissynergies related to the spin-off of Supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation.
Based on the continued excellent performance of our utility operations, the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments and the results of our corporate restructuring efforts, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017.
As shown here on Slide 5, for 2015, we're anticipating small increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities, and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. The slide also shows a significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as a result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time we announced the spin-off. At the outset of the year, I mentioned that 2015 is very much a transitional year for PPL.
On April 1, our U.K. Regulated segment transitioned to the new RIIO-ED1 8-year price control period. On June 1, the spin-off of our Supply business and creation of Talen Energy will be completed. In Kentucky, we expect our rate case to be concluded in the second quarter with new rates taking effect July 1. And in Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in late March, and we're working through the Public Utility Commission's review process. All these 2015 initiatives are on track and we're really pleased with the progress thus far.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Kentucky Regulated operations. We continue to make progress on our Kentucky rate proceedings, reaching a settlement agreement in April, with all the parties in the base rate cases before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. If the settlement is approved by the commission, it will result in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky Utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at Louisville Gas and Electric. The settlement focuses on the total amount of costs we can recover rather than establishing a return on equity with respect to base rates. While this settlement did not establish an ROE for base rates, we will earn a 10% return on equity investment related to the environmental cost recovery mechanism and our gas line tracker mechanism. The settlement agreement also provides for deferred cost recovery on a portion of the cost associated with pensions and Kentucky Utilities Green River plant, which is scheduled to be retired in April of 2016. We are pleased, we are able to reach a unanimous settlement with the parties to the case. As I mentioned, we anticipate that new rates will go into effect on July 1 of this year.
We also continue to focus on major capital projects in Kentucky. Recent milestones include the retirement of our Cane Run Unit 6 coal-fired generating unit, the first of 3 units that are being retired at that facility. The retirement comes as the company prepares to bring its new Cane Run 7 combined cycle gas-fired unit online later this quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. On March 31, we filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for an increase of $167.5 million in annual distribution revenue requirement at PPL Electric Utilities. This request is driven by investments we're making to our new, strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. If approved by the PUC, we expect the increase to take effect January 1, 2016. We're also set to energize the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in just a few days. This $630 million project represents a major upgrade to the nation's electric grid. The new 500 kV power line will strengthen reliability for millions of people in the Northeast.
The 3-year project created significant economic development benefits in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including the creation of about 2,000 construction jobs. This project was 1 of 7 projects nationwide to be fast tracked by the Obama Administration's Rapid Response Team, recognizing its importance.
Building a major transmission line like this requires a tremendous amount of planning, communication and cooperation with many different stakeholders, including government agencies, PSEG, our neighboring utility who partner with us on the construction of the line, local officials and the public. Many people were involved in making this project a success. I appreciate their dedication and the achievement. This project is a great example of our ability to execute major capital projects that add value for both customers and shareowners.
Turning to Slide 8, let's briefly discuss domestic weather normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the first quarter were down about 0.5% with residential, commercial and industrial usage all lower compared to a year ago. Kentucky experienced lower sales volumes due to a longer period of cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2015 as well as more extreme weather last year compared to this year. As you can see, first quarter weather normalized 2015 sales were also lower in Pennsylvania than in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven by lower residential and industrial sales, offset slightly by higher commercial sales.
The 2015 weather-normalized sales are 1.2% below 2014. Similar to Kentucky, weather-normalized sales comparisons to 2014 are difficult due to extreme weather impacts. Although the winter of 2015 was slightly colder than the winter of 2014, 2014's polar vortex was much more volatile with more temperature swings. On a rolling 12-month basis, total weather-normalized sales in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania were essentially flat for the 12 months ending March 31, 2015, compared to the previous 12-month period.
Moving to Slide 9. We continue to make significant progress related to the spin-off of our competitive generation business which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. We've now received all the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the transaction, including from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. We expect to close on the transaction, June 1.
Talen Energy common stock is expected to begin trading on a when-issued basis on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLN WI, beginning on May 18. On June 2, regular-way trading of Talen Energy common stock will begin under the symbol TLN Immediately following the transaction, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy's outstanding common stock, with Riverstone's affiliates owning the remaining 35%. The PPL Board of Directors has declared a pro-rata distribution to PPL shareowners of record on May 20. The distribution ratio is expected to be approximately 0.125 Talen shares for each PPL share, and will take place on June 1. PPL will announce the definitive distribution ratio promptly after the record date, based on the actual number of PPL shares outstanding on that date.
Our PPL and Talent transition teams have done a great job of coordinating a transition process that will allow Talen Energy to operate safely and efficiently on day 1, and result in a lower cost corporate structure for PPL going forward.
Before turning the call over to Vince, I would reiterate that we had a solid start to 2015, and we we're able to reach a settlement in the rate case in Kentucky. And as Vince is going to review shortly, PPL's got a strong foundation for future success as a pure play regulated utility company. PPL's taking significant steps, as many of you know, to preserve and create shareowner value over the last several years. As we approach June 1, which will consummate the formation of Talen Energy, I want to just take a moment to thank all the PPL employees and future Talen employees that have made this significant effort possible. And for all the past contributions of our PPL Energy Supply employees. I'd also like to thank Paul Farr for his leadership, not only with the spin of our Energy Supply business, but also for the 7 years he spent as PPL's CFO. I appreciate all they've done and wish them much success.
I'll now ask Vince to provide an update on the first quarter segment results. Vince?"

As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment",1377,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Today, I will be comparing our regulated utility earnings results to our adjusted 2014 results. As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment and adjust for the dissynergies related to the spin. These adjustments are consistent in approach with the full-year adjustments we made to our 2014 year-end results. I will discuss our Supply segment results separately.
Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment and in an improvement in corporate and other. While the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments remained flat to a year ago. Although weather was flat for the domestic utilities compared to last year, it was better than normal by about $0.03.
And while earnings from ongoing operations in the U.K. increased significantly in the quarter compared to a year ago, we continue to expect earnings for this segment to be up only slightly on a full year basis. This is driven by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, offset by improvements in income taxes, depreciation expense and the effects of foreign currency. 
The increase in corporate and other earnings from ongoing operations was primarily due to the benefits of the corporate restructuring as we expected.
As we've mentioned, the corporate restructuring effort is well underway, and we are already beginning to see those benefits. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve the targeted $75 million in corporate support cost savings we discussed during our previous call. The Supply first quarter earnings from ongoing operations also remain the same as the first quarter 2014.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in the first quarter 2015, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenue due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Lower depreciation expense driven by the completion of a periodic useful life assessment of certain fixed assets that resulted in an extension of our network asset lives, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to asset additions. Lower financing costs due to lower interest on our index linked debt, favorable effects from foreign currency, and lower income taxes and other from a lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to less favorable weather compared to last year and higher income taxes.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the first quarter, also comparable to last year. This was primarily due to higher margins from additional transmission investments, partially offset by a benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Finishing our segment review with Supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2015, the same as a year ago, despite the benefit of the unusual -- unusually cold weather we experienced in Q1 of last year. Excluding the $0.03 weather impact from 2014, the results were higher primarily due to higher energy prices, favorable base load generation and higher intermediate and peaking margins offset by lower capacity prices, lower results from full requirement sales contracts and certain other commodity positions. We also had lower payroll cost and lower financing cost compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide, we detail our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. 
First, we continue to be hedged at 97% for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.60. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage slightly from 70% at year-end to 72% today, at an average rate of $1.61. We also started to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we are now 20% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.60.
You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure for the remainder of 2015, minimal exposure in 2016, and about $0.04 of exposure in 2017, if our average hedged rate is $1.55 and $0.07 of exposure if it's $1.50. Also on this slide, we are showing an RPI sensitivity. Under the real methodology, our revenues for the 2015-'16 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in the 2017-'18 time period will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015-'16 regulatory year.
Current RPI forecasts using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest a 2015-'16 inflation rate of about 2% compared to the 2.6% included in our current revenues. Therefore, we are providing a sensitivity for a 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-2016 time period. RPI forecast for 2016 and beyond are either at or above our assumed 3%. RPI affects 3 primary financial drivers for WPD: our revenues; our O&M; and the interest expense on our index-linked debt. The lower RPI we are currently experiencing does not have a significant effect on our 2015 or 2016 U.K. earnings guidance we provided during our year-end call. 
For 2017, since this is the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, the lower 2015-'16 RPI of 50 basis points or RPI of about 2% would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017.
Moving to Slide 16. We're providing an updated view of our cash repatriation ability in the U.K. Since our year-end update, we continue to evaluate our ability to repatriate cash from the U.K. We expect to increase our 2015 cash repatriation by about 10% over the information we provided on the year-end earnings call to about $300 million. We believe we have additional capacity beyond that, and for 2016 and 2017, we now forecast that we can bring up to $500 million per year. We are showing ranges here of $300 million to $500 million for 2016 and '17 as we determine the amount based on our domestic cash needs at that time.
We recognize that at $300 million of U.K. distributions per year, the domestic payout ratio to fund our dividend was over 100% beginning in 2016. With our ability to dividend between $300 million and $500 million a year from WPD over the next few years, we would target to get the domestic payout ratio back under 100% for 2016, and continue to lower that domestic payout ratio in 2017 and '18. We are confident we can fund the PPL dividend and continue to grow it modestly, while we're in this period of high CapEx spending.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I also want to provide an update on our expectations for bonus revenues in the U.K., since we receive a lot of questions on this topic. As we enter the RIIO-ED1 price control period, we expect to earn lower bonus revenues as our ability to outperform will be more challenging, given the tighter performance targets under RIIO. Rick Klingensmith has discussed this topic on our previous call.
This will result in lower bonus revenues starting in 2017. Our business plan assumes $120 million of bonus revenues for 2015, between $120 million and $130 million for 2016, and between $80 million and $100 million for 2017. And for 2018, when the full impact of the tighter performance targets is seen, we would expect to earn between $60 million and $90 million in bonus revenues.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And again I think a lot of that it would be tough to group together some of that other DR. So I think a lot of that kind of falls out to base. And then even though we've got really strong [indiscernible] for our fleet, if you've got coal assets that have been very challenged economically, and you've not been putting capital into the plan, and you have a very hard time forecasting forced outage rate, so it becomes very difficult to predict penalties.

And then the other assets that are in the system, like our hydro assets that would get de-rated or renewables assets that get de-rated kind all is well kind of fall out.

We will continue to seek out areas of efficiency and use technology in any other applications that we can going forward, and we will expect some level of ongoing efficiencies. But probably not at the same level you saw as we had with the changes that we made with the Midlands properties.

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 first quarter earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials. He'll also provide an update on our U.K. operations, including our improved currency hedge status, a new look at our sensitivity to changes in RPI or U.K. inflation, and our enhanced ability to repatriate cash. Then we will take your questions.
The first quarter of 2015 marked a successful start to the year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results, overall, with solid performance across our regulated utility businesses. The competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite ongoing challenging market conditions.
As I'll describe in more detail shortly, we're on track to complete the spin-off of Supply on June 1.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter 2015 reported earnings of $0.96 per share, an increase of $0.47 from our first quarter 2014 results. Adjusting for special items, our regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations were $0.77 per share, up 17% from first quarter 2014 adjusted regulated utility results.
If you recall from our 2014 year-end earnings call, we discussed excluding the Supply segment earnings and net costs associated with the Supply spin-off from our ongoing earnings to provide results for our regulated utility operations. This approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the forward -- going forward part of our PPL portfolio.
Consistent with that approach, we've adjusted the ongoing earnings on this slide to focus on our regulated utility operations. With regards to regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations, I'm pleased with the increase we achieved in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago. Strong first quarter earnings at our U.K. Regulated segment drove the 17% increase. Vince will provide more details on all the quarterly results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. Based on first quarter performance, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations. The mid-point of this range, $2.15 per share, is approximately 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removes Supply earnings and includes the full impact of dissynergies related to the spin-off of Supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation.
Based on the continued excellent performance of our utility operations, the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments and the results of our corporate restructuring efforts, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017.
As shown here on Slide 5, for 2015, we're anticipating small increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities, and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. The slide also shows the significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as a result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time we announced the spin-off. At the outset of the year, I mentioned that 2015 is very much a transitional year for PPL.
On April 1, our U.K. Regulated segment transitioned to the new RIIO-ED1 8-year price control period. On June 1, the spin-off of our Supply business and creation of Talen Energy will be completed. In Kentucky, we expect our rate case to be concluded in the second quarter with new rates taking effect July 1. And in Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in late March, and we're working through the Public Utility Commission's review process. All these 2015 initiatives are on track and we're really pleased with the progress thus far.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Kentucky Regulated operations. We continue to make progress on our Kentucky rate proceedings, reaching a settlement agreement in April, with all the parties in the base rate cases before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. If the settlement is approved by the commission, it will result in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky Utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at Louisville Gas and Electric. The settlement focuses on the total amount of costs we can recover rather than establishing a return on equity with respect to base rates. While this settlement did not establish an ROE for base rates, we will earn a 10% return on equity investment related to the environmental cost recovery mechanism and our gas line tracker mechanism. The settlement agreement also provides for deferred cost recovery on a portion of the cost associated with pensions and Kentucky Utilities Green River plant, which is scheduled to be retired in April 2016. We are pleased we are able to reach a unanimous settlement with the parties to the case. As I mentioned, we anticipate that new rates will go into effect on July 1 of this year.
We also continue to focus on major capital projects in Kentucky. Recent milestones include the retirement of our Cane Run Unit 6 coal-fired generating unit, the first of 3 units that are being retired at that facility. The retirement comes as the company prepares to bring its new Cane Run 7 combined cycle gas-fired unit online later this quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. On March 31, we filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for an increase of $167.5 million in annual distribution revenue requirement at PPL Electric Utilities. This request is driven by investments we're making to renew, strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. If approved by the PUC, we expect the increase to take effect January 1, 2016. We're also set to energize the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in just a few days. This $630 million project represents a major upgrade to the nation's electric grid. The new 500 kV power line will strengthen reliability for millions of people in the Northeast.
The 3-year project created significant economic development benefits in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including the creation of about 2,000 construction jobs. This project was 1 of 7 projects nationwide to be fast tracked by the Obama Administration's Rapid Response Team, recognizing its importance.
Building a major transmission line like this requires a tremendous amount of planning, communication and cooperation with many different stakeholders, including government agencies, PSEG, our neighboring utility who partner with us on the construction of the line, local officials and the public. Many people were involved in making this project a success. I appreciate their dedication and the achievement. This project is a great example of our ability to execute major capital projects that add value for both customers and shareowners.
Turning to Slide 8, let's briefly discuss domestic weather normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the first quarter were down about 0.5% with residential, commercial and industrial usage all lower compared to a year ago. Kentucky experienced lower sales volumes due to a longer period of cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2015 as well as more extreme weather last year compared to this year. As you can see, first quarter weather normalized 2015 sales were also lower in Pennsylvania than in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven by lower residential and industrial sales, offset slightly by higher commercial sales.
The 2015 weather-normalized sales are 1.2% below 2014. Similar to Kentucky, weather-normalized sales comparisons to 2014 are difficult due to extreme weather impacts. Although the winter of 2015 was slightly colder than the winter of 2014, 2014's polar vortex was much more volatile with more temperature swings. On a rolling 12-month basis, total weather-normalized sales in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania were essentially flat for the 12 months ending March 31, 2015, compared to the previous 12-month period.
Moving to Slide 9. We continue to make significant progress related to the spin-off of our competitive generation business which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. We've now received all the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the transaction, including from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. We expect to close on the transaction June 1.
Talen Energy common stock is expected to begin trading on a when-issued basis on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLN WI, beginning on May 18. On June 2, regular-way trading of Talen Energy common stock will begin under the symbol TLN. Immediately following the transaction, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy's outstanding common stock, with Riverstone's affiliates owning the remaining 35%. The PPL Board of Directors has declared a pro-rata distribution to PPL shareowners of record on May 20. The distribution ratio is expected to be approximately 0.125 Talen shares for each PPL share, and will take place on June 1. PPL will announce the definitive distribution ratio promptly after the record date, based on the actual number of PPL shares outstanding on that date.
Our PPL and Talent transition teams have done a great job of coordinating a transition process that will allow Talen Energy to operate safely and efficiently on day 1, and result in a lower cost corporate structure for PPL going forward.
Before turning the call over to Vince, I would reiterate that we had a solid start to 2015, and we were able to reach a settlement in the rate case in Kentucky. And as Vince is going to review shortly, PPL's got a strong foundation for future success as a pure play regulated utility company. PPL's taken significant steps, as many of you know, to preserve and create shareowner value over the last several years. As we approach June 1, which will consummate the formation of Talen Energy, I want to just take a moment to thank all the PPL employees and future Talen employees that have made this significant effort possible. And for all the past contributions of our PPL Energy Supply employees. I'd also like to thank Paul Farr for his leadership, not only with the spin of our Energy Supply business, but also for the 7 years he spent as PPL's CFO. I appreciate all they've done and wish them much success.
I'll now ask Vince to provide an update on the first quarter segment results. Vince?"

Today, I will be comparing our regulated utility earnings results to our adjusted 2014 results. As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment and adjust for the dissynergies related to the spin. These adjustments are consistent in approach with the full-year adjustments we made to our 2014 year-end results. I will discuss our Supply segment results separately.
Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment and in an improvement in corporate and other. While the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments remained flat to a year ago. Although weather was flat for the domestic utilities compared to last year, it was better than normal by about $0.03.
And while earnings from ongoing operations in the U.K. increased significantly in the quarter compared to a year ago, we continue to expect earnings for this segment to be up only slightly on a full year basis. This is driven by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, offset by improvements in income taxes, depreciation expense and the effects of foreign currency. 
The increase in corporate and other earnings from ongoing operations was primarily due to the benefits of the corporate restructuring as we expected.
As we've mentioned, the corporate restructuring effort is well underway, and we are already beginning to see those benefits. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve the targeted $75 million in corporate support cost savings we discussed during our previous calls. The Supply first quarter earnings from ongoing operations also remain the same as the first quarter 2014.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in the first quarter 2015, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenue due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Lower depreciation expense driven by the completion of a periodic useful life assessment of certain fixed assets that resulted in an extension of our network asset lives, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to asset additions. Lower financing costs due to lower interest on our index linked debt, favorable effects from foreign currency, and lower income taxes and other from a lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to less favorable weather compared to last year and higher income taxes.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the first quarter, also comparable to last year. This was primarily due to higher margins from additional transmission investments, partially offset by a benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Finishing our segment review with Supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2015, the same as a year ago, despite the benefit of the unusual -- unusually cold weather we experienced in Q1 of last year. Excluding the $0.03 weather impact from 2014, the results were higher primarily due to higher energy prices, favorable base load generation and higher intermediate and peaking margins offset by lower capacity prices, lower results from full requirement sales contracts and certain other commodity positions. We also had lower payroll cost and lower financing cost compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide, we detail our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. 
First, we continue to be hedged at 97% for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.60. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage slightly from 70% at year-end to 72% today, at an average rate of $1.61. We also started to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we are now 20% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.60.
You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure for the remainder of 2015, minimal exposure in 2016, and about $0.04 of exposure in 2017, if our average hedged rate is $1.55 and $0.07 of exposure if it's $1.50. Also on this slide, we are showing an RPI sensitivity. Under the real methodology, our revenues for the 2015-'16 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in the 2017-'18 time period will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015-'16 regulatory year.
Current RPI forecasts using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest a 2015-'16 inflation rate of about 2% compared to the 2.6% included in our current revenues. Therefore, we are providing a sensitivity for a 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-2016 time period. RPI forecast for 2016 and beyond are either at or above our assumed 3%. RPI affects 3 primary financial drivers for WPD: our revenues; our O&M; and the interest expense on our index-linked debt. The lower RPI we are currently experiencing does not have a significant effect on our 2015 or 2016 U.K. earnings guidance we provided during our year-end call. 
For 2017, since this is the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, the lower 2015-'16 RPI of 50 basis points or RPI of about 2% would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017.
Moving to Slide 16. We're providing an updated view of our cash repatriation ability in the U.K. Since our year-end update, we continue to evaluate our ability to repatriate cash from the U.K. We expect to increase our 2015 cash repatriation by about 10% over the information we provided on the year-end earnings call to about $300 million. We believe we have additional capacity beyond that, and for 2016 and 2017, we now forecast that we can bring up to $500 million per year. We are showing ranges here of $300 million to $500 million for 2016 and '17 as we will determine the amount based on our domestic cash needs at that time.
We recognize that at $300 million of U.K. distributions per year, the domestic payout ratio to fund our dividend was over 100% beginning in 2016. With our ability to dividend between $300 million and $500 million a year from WPD over the next few years, we would target to get the domestic payout ratio back under 100% for 2016, and continue to lower that domestic payout ratio in 2017 and '18. We are confident we can fund the PPL dividend and continue to grow it modestly while we're in this period of high CapEx spending.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I also want to provide an update on our expectations for bonus revenues in the U.K., since we receive a lot of questions on this topic. As we enter the RIIO-ED1 price control period, we expect to earn lower bonus revenues as our ability to outperform will be more challenging, given the tighter performance targets under RIIO. Rick Klingensmith has discussed this topic on our previous call.
This will result in lower bonus revenues starting in 2017. Our business plan assumes $120 million of bonus revenues for 2015, between $120 million and $130 million for 2016, and between $80 million and $100 million for 2017. And for 2018, when the full impact of the tighter performance targets is seen, we would expect to earn between $60 million and $90 million in bonus revenues.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And I think a lot of that it would be tough to group together some of that other DR. So I think a lot of that kind of falls out to base. And then even though we've got really strong E4Ds [ph] for our fleet, if you've got coal assets that have been very challenged economically, and you've not been putting capital into the plan, and you have a very hard time forecasting a forced outage rate, so it becomes very difficult to predict penalties, I think you effectively bid those based simply because you're not willing to take the penalty exposure. And then the other assets that are in the system, like our hydro assets that would get de-rated or renewables assets that get de-rated all as well kind of fall out.

So our expectation is not a very significant or material change in the way we operate the business and the way we're performing on the business to deliver the high levels of reliability, the high levels of customer service. We will continue to seek out areas of efficiency and use technology in any other applications that we can going forward, and we will expect some level of ongoing efficiencies. But probably not at the same level you saw as we had with the changes that we made with the Midlands properties.

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 first quarter earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials. He'll also provide an update on our U.K. operations, including our improved currency hedge status, a new look at our sensitivity to changes in RPI or U.K. inflation, and our enhanced ability to repatriate cash. Then we will take your questions.
The first quarter of 2015 marked a successful start to the year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results, overall, with solid performance across our regulated utility businesses. The competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite ongoing challenging market conditions.
As I'll describe in more detail shortly, we're on track to complete the spin-off of Supply on June 1.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter 2015 reported earnings of $0.96 per share, an increase of $0.47 from our first quarter 2014 results. Adjusting for special items, our regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations were $0.77 per share, up 17% from first quarter 2014 adjusted regulated utility results.
If you recall from our 2014 year-end earnings call, we discussed excluding the Supply segment earnings and net costs associated with the Supply spin-off from our ongoing earnings to provide results for our regulated utility operations. This approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the forward -- going forward part of our PPL portfolio.
Consistent with that approach, we've adjusted the ongoing earnings on this slide to focus on our regulated utility operations. With regards to regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations, I'm pleased with the increase we achieved in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago. Strong first quarter earnings at our U.K. Regulated segment drove the 17% increase. Vince will provide more details on all the quarterly results during his remarks.
Let's move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. Based on first quarter performance, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations. The mid-point of this range, $2.15 per share, is approximately 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removes Supply earnings and includes the full impact of dissynergies related to the spin-off of Supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation.
Based on the continued excellent performance of our utility operations, the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments and the results of our corporate restructuring efforts, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017.
As shown here on Slide 5, for 2015, we're anticipating small increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities, and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. The slide also shows the significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as a result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time we announced the spin-off. At the outset of the year, I mentioned that 2015 is very much a transitional year for PPL.
On April 1, our U.K. Regulated segment transitioned to the new RIIO-ED1 8-year price control period. On June 1, the spin-off of our Supply business and creation of Talen Energy will be completed. In Kentucky, we expect our rate case to be concluded in the second quarter with new rates taking effect July 1. And in Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in late March, and we're working through the Public Utility Commission's review process. All these 2015 initiatives are on track and we're really pleased with the progress thus far.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Kentucky Regulated operations. We continue to make progress on our Kentucky rate proceedings, reaching a settlement agreement in April, with all the parties in the base rate cases before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. If the settlement is approved by the commission, it will result in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky Utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at Louisville Gas and Electric. The settlement focuses on the total amount of costs we can recover rather than establishing a return on equity with respect to base rates. While this settlement did not establish an ROE for base rates, we will earn a 10% return on equity investment related to the environmental cost recovery mechanism and our gas line tracker mechanism. The settlement agreement also provides for deferred cost recovery on a portion of the cost associated with pensions and Kentucky Utilities Green River plant, which is scheduled to be retired in April 2016. We are pleased we are able to reach a unanimous settlement with the parties to the case. As I mentioned, we anticipate that new rates will go into effect on July 1 of this year.
We also continue to focus on major capital projects in Kentucky. Recent milestones include the retirement of our Cane Run Unit 6 coal-fired generating unit, the first of 3 units that are being retired at that facility. The retirement comes as the company prepares to bring its new Cane Run 7 combined cycle gas-fired unit online later this quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. On March 31, we filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for an increase of $167.5 million in annual distribution revenue requirement at PPL Electric Utilities. This request is driven by investments we're making to renew, strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. If approved by the PUC, we expect the increase to take effect January 1, 2016. We're also set to energize the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in just a few days. This $630 million project represents a major upgrade to the nation's electric grid. The new 500 kV power line will strengthen reliability for millions of people in the Northeast.
The 3-year project created significant economic development benefits in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including the creation of about 2,000 construction jobs. This project was 1 of 7 projects nationwide to be fast tracked by the Obama Administration's Rapid Response Team, recognizing its importance.
Building a major transmission line like this requires a tremendous amount of planning, communication and cooperation with many different stakeholders, including government agencies, PSEG, our neighboring utility who partner with us on the construction of the line, local officials and the public. Many people were involved in making this project a success. I appreciate their dedication and the achievement. This project is a great example of our ability to execute major capital projects that add value for both customers and shareowners.
Turning to Slide 8, let's briefly discuss domestic weather normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the first quarter were down about 0.5% with residential, commercial and industrial usage all lower compared to a year ago. Kentucky experienced lower sales volumes due to a longer period of cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2015 as well as more extreme weather last year compared to this year. As you can see, first quarter weather normalized 2015 sales were also lower in Pennsylvania than in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven by lower residential and industrial sales, offset slightly by higher commercial sales.
The 2015 weather-normalized sales are 1.2% below 2014. Similar to Kentucky, weather-normalized sales comparisons to 2014 are difficult due to extreme weather impacts. Although the winter of 2015 was slightly colder than the winter of 2014, 2014's polar vortex was much more volatile with more temperature swings. On a rolling 12-month basis, total weather-normalized sales in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania were essentially flat for the 12 months ending March 31, 2015, compared to the previous 12-month period.
Moving to Slide 9. We continue to make significant progress related to the spin-off of our competitive generation business which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. We've now received all the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the transaction, including from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. We expect to close on the transaction June 1.
Talen Energy common stock is expected to begin trading on a when-issued basis on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLN WI, beginning on May 18. On June 2, regular-way trading of Talen Energy common stock will begin under the symbol TLN. Immediately following the transaction, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy's outstanding common stock, with Riverstone's affiliates owning the remaining 35%. The PPL Board of Directors has declared a pro-rata distribution to PPL shareowners of record on May 20. The distribution ratio is expected to be approximately 0.125 Talen shares for each PPL share, and will take place on June 1. PPL will announce the definitive distribution ratio promptly after the record date, based on the actual number of PPL shares outstanding on that date.
Our PPL and Talent transition teams have done a great job of coordinating a transition process that will allow Talen Energy to operate safely and efficiently on day 1, and result in a lower cost corporate structure for PPL going forward.
Before turning the call over to Vince, I would reiterate that we had a solid start to 2015, and we were able to reach a settlement in the rate case in Kentucky. And as Vince is going to review shortly, PPL's got a strong foundation for future success as a pure play regulated utility company. PPL's taken significant steps, as many of you know, to preserve and create shareowner value over the last several years. As we approach June 1, which will consummate the formation of Talen Energy, I want to just take a moment to thank all the PPL employees and future Talen employees that have made this significant effort possible. And for all the past contributions of our PPL Energy Supply employees. I'd also like to thank Paul Farr for his leadership, not only with the spin of our Energy Supply business, but also for the 7 years he spent as PPL's CFO. I appreciate all they've done and wish them much success.
I'll now ask Vince to provide an update on the first quarter segment results. Vince?"

Today, I will be comparing our regulated utility earnings results to our adjusted 2014 results. As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment and adjust for the dissynergies related to the spin. These adjustments are consistent in approach with the full-year adjustments we made to our 2014 year-end results. I will discuss our Supply segment results separately.
Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment and in an improvement in corporate and other. While the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments remained flat to a year ago. Although weather was flat for the domestic utilities compared to last year, it was better than normal by about $0.03.
And while earnings from ongoing operations in the U.K. increased significantly in the quarter compared to a year ago, we continue to expect earnings for this segment to be up only slightly on a full year basis. This is driven by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, offset by improvements in income taxes, depreciation expense and the effects of foreign currency. 
The increase in corporate and other earnings from ongoing operations was primarily due to the benefits of the corporate restructuring as we expected.
As we've mentioned, the corporate restructuring effort is well underway, and we are already beginning to see those benefits. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve the targeted $75 million in corporate support cost savings we discussed during our previous calls. The Supply first quarter earnings from ongoing operations also remain the same as the first quarter 2014.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in the first quarter 2015, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenue due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Lower depreciation expense driven by the completion of a periodic useful life assessment of certain fixed assets that resulted in an extension of our network asset lives, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to asset additions. Lower financing costs due to lower interest on our index linked debt, favorable effects from foreign currency, and lower income taxes and other from a lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to less favorable weather compared to last year and higher income taxes.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the first quarter, also comparable to last year. This was primarily due to higher margins from additional transmission investments, partially offset by a benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Finishing our segment review with Supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2015, the same as a year ago, despite the benefit of the unusual -- unusually cold weather we experienced in Q1 of last year. Excluding the $0.03 weather impact from 2014, the results were higher primarily due to higher energy prices, favorable base load generation and higher intermediate and peaking margins offset by lower capacity prices, lower results from full requirement sales contracts and certain other commodity positions. We also had lower payroll cost and lower financing cost compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide, we detail our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. 
First, we continue to be hedged at 97% for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.60. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage slightly from 70% at year-end to 72% today, at an average rate of $1.61. We also started to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we are now 20% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.60.
You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure for the remainder of 2015, minimal exposure in 2016, and about $0.04 of exposure in 2017, if our average hedged rate is $1.55 and $0.07 of exposure if it's $1.50. Also on this slide, we are showing an RPI sensitivity. Under the real methodology, our revenues for the 2015-'16 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in the 2017-'18 time period will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015-'16 regulatory year.
Current RPI forecasts using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest a 2015-'16 inflation rate of about 2% compared to the 2.6% included in our current revenues. Therefore, we are providing a sensitivity for a 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-2016 time period. RPI forecast for 2016 and beyond are either at or above our assumed 3%. RPI affects 3 primary financial drivers for WPD: our revenues; our O&M; and the interest expense on our index-linked debt. The lower RPI we are currently experiencing does not have a significant effect on our 2015 or 2016 U.K. earnings guidance we provided during our year-end call. 
For 2017, since this is the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, the lower 2015-'16 RPI of 50 basis points or RPI of about 2% would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017.
Moving to Slide 16. We're providing an updated view of our cash repatriation ability in the U.K. Since our year-end update, we continue to evaluate our ability to repatriate cash from the U.K. We expect to increase our 2015 cash repatriation by about 10% over the information we provided on the year-end earnings call to about $300 million. We believe we have additional capacity beyond that, and for 2016 and 2017, we now forecast that we can bring up to $500 million per year. We are showing ranges here of $300 million to $500 million for 2016 and '17 as we will determine the amount based on our domestic cash needs at that time.
We recognize that at $300 million of U.K. distributions per year, the domestic payout ratio to fund our dividend was over 100% beginning in 2016. With our ability to dividend between $300 million and $500 million a year from WPD over the next few years, we would target to get the domestic payout ratio back under 100% for 2016, and continue to lower that domestic payout ratio in 2017 and '18. We are confident we can fund the PPL dividend and continue to grow it modestly while we're in this period of high CapEx spending.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I also want to provide an update on our expectations for bonus revenues in the U.K., since we receive a lot of questions on this topic. As we enter the RIIO-ED1 price control period, we expect to earn lower bonus revenues as our ability to outperform will be more challenging, given the tighter performance targets under RIIO. Rick Klingensmith has discussed this topic on our previous call.
This will result in lower bonus revenues starting in 2017. Our business plan assumes $120 million of bonus revenues for 2015, between $120 million and $130 million for 2016, and between $80 million and $100 million for 2017. And for 2018, when the full impact of the tighter performance targets is seen, we would expect to earn between $60 million and $90 million in bonus revenues.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And I think a lot of that it would be tough to group together some of that other DR. So I think a lot of that kind of falls out to base. And then even though we've got really strong E4Ds [ph] for our fleet, if you've got coal assets that have been very challenged economically, and you've not been putting capital into the plan, and you have a very hard time forecasting a forced outage rate, so it becomes very difficult to predict penalties, I think you effectively bid those based simply because you're not willing to take the penalty exposure. And then the other assets that are in the system, like our hydro assets that would get de-rated or renewables assets that get de-rated all as well kind of fall out.

So our expectation is not a very significant or material change in the way we operate the business and the way we're performing on the business to deliver the high levels of reliability, the high levels of customer service. We will continue to seek out areas of efficiency and use technology in any other applications that we can going forward, and we will expect some level of ongoing efficiencies. But probably not at the same level you saw as we had with the changes that we made with the Midlands properties.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the President of our 3 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. You will see an agenda for today's discussion. As we typically do, we'll provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results, which I'm pleased to say includes significant growth in earnings from ongoing operations. We'll discuss our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are increasing, along with our dividend, based on the continued strong performance of our utilities, and I'll provide an operational overview as well. Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. And as always, we'll have plenty of time to answer your questions.
But before we dive into the quarterly results, I'd like to share with you my thoughts about the new PPL. As you know, June 1 marked a major milestone in our company's history. On that day, we completed the spin-off of our competitive supply business. And in doing so, we completed a strategic transformation of PPL that began with our acquisition of 2 regulated utilities in Kentucky, followed by the expansion of our Utility Operations in United Kingdom. It's a transformation that has been exceptionally well executed, provides earnings and dividend growth potential, will creates significant value for our shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success. Today, in our first earnings call, since the spin-off of the Supply segment, our focus has never been clear. Our ability to control our own destiny to proven track route if execution has never been greater. And I without a doubt have never been more excited about where we're headed.
Moving to Slide 4. Let me expand on some of the reasons why. PPL is now a pure-play, regulated utility investment, made up of 7 high-performing award-winning and growing utility companies. Year-in and year-out, these utilities prove themselves to be among the best in our industry. In our diverse and located in different regions with different regulatory structures. They offer a mix of regulated assets define anywhere else in our sector. Each utility operates in what we consider to be in premium jurisdiction. In addition, all utilities are investing heavily in infrastructure producing robust rate base growth for PPL.
In fact, organic growth in our domestic utilities is amongst the strongest in the U.S. utility sector, with 8%, 10% earnings growth expected through 2017. We expect our combined rate based in the U.S. alone to grow by 47% over the next 5 years.  That's the equivalent of adding and other major utility to our portfolio.
Our balance sheet is strong and so our cash flows, credit ratings and very competitive dividend. The bottom line, we believe the new PPL with its strong growth profile, a solid dividend and a diverse mix of holdings is a unique and very compelling investment option in the U.S. Utilities Sector.
Looking at Slide 5, you can see that robust rate base growth combined with jurisdictions that permit near real-time recovery of our infrastructure investments is what will drive our targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. I want to point out that the 2017 $2.35 of earnings per share shown here represents a projection based on the midpoint of our 4% to 6% compound annual growth target of our 2014 adjusted earnings. It does not represent earnings guidance for 2017. Across the portfolio, over $10 billion in CapEx spending is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of more than 7% or $5 billion by the end of 2017. For 2015 through 2017, over 80% of that CapEx earns a return within 12 months. And approximately 76% in less than 6 months. this combination creates a very strong foundation for future earnings growth.
Let's turn to Slide 6. This slide offers additional detail on why we feel our U.S. Operations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky operate in contrastive, regulatory environments. Domestically, we have favorable allowed ROEs in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. When coupled with the numerous recovery mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag, including the in Pennsylvania and ECR in Kentucky, we're well positioned to achieve our earnings growth targets. We have excellent growth in transmission with allowed base ROEs of 11.68% to the FERC formula rate a 12.93% allowed ROE for the $630 million Susquehanna-Roseland project, as well as a return for the $335 million Northeast/Pocono reliability project in Pennsylvania.
It's this west of trackers and recovery mechanisms that drives the rapid recovery as described on the prior slide of 76% of our CapEx earning and return in less than 6 months and over 80% earning retuned in less than 12 months.
Turning to Slide 7, we provide a more detailed look at why we also believe the U.K. offers a superior regulatory jurisdiction. The RIIO-ED1 framework in the U.K. provides long-term inflation adjusted rate certainty without volumetric exposure, Ofgem has accepted our business plans, which include total spend of over $19 billion over the 8-year regulatory period. About $11 billion of that spend will drive growth in our regulated asses value or RAV. It also offers the potential to outperform through performance incentives, which as you know WPD has been very successful at earning in the past. And it offers us the opportunity to earn an adjusted expected return on equity in the mid-to upper teens through 2017.
We're uniquely positioned with our history of strong performance and innovation to earn this favorable returns in this premium jurisdiction. Our utilities in the U.K. are the 4 best performers in the country. They were the only utilities to be approved for fast tracking of their business plans under REO. This enables to collect additional revenue of about $43 million annually, and retain 70% of cost efficiencies compared to about 55% for the slow tract DNOs. And the U.K. business is self-funding, and does not require any equity from PPL. In fact, we have the flexibility to dividend between $300 million and $500 million of cash back to the U.S. annually in a tax efficient manner.
Turning to Slide 8, our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend raising it from $1.49 to $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 13th dividend increase in 14 years. The quarterly dividend of $0.3775 per share will be payable October 1 to shareowners of record as of September 10. The increase in the dividend is consistent with our prior messaging that we would look to raise to dividend after the completion of the 
Turning to Slide 9, in summary, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 4% to 6% earnings growth targets to at least 2017. We expect 8% to 10% growth in our domestic utility earnings, and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring efforts, which combined are more than offsetting relatively flat earnings expectations in our U.K. business over this time period.
There are several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utility, and these include strong transmission rate base growth of 18.9% through 2017 in Pennsylvania, limited volumetric risk in our distribution operation in Pennsylvania due to our rate structures and recovery mechanisms, environmental spending and favorable rate case outcome -- outcomes contribute to our growth in Kentucky. And outside the U.S. the U.K. spending program of $4.8 billion along with our projected incentive return support our overall RAV growth and strong financial performance. 
Before turning to our quarterly results, I want to reiterate how optimistic I'm about PPL's future. I believe PPL's of assets are low overall business and regulatory risk and our proven track record f earnings performance in transparency set us apart from our peers. It's a new day for PPL, but we'll continue to customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 11, today we reported a second quarter 2015 loss or $757 million or $1.13 per share. This reflects $1 billion loss or $1.50  per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1 spin-off of our competitive supply business. The loss from discontinued operations included an $879 million loss reflecting the fair value of the supply business at the time of the spin-off compared to the recorded value of this segment. Vince will address the loss from the discontinued operations in more detail in his remarks. By comparison, second quarter 2014 retorted earnings were $229 million or $0.34 per share. The reported loss for the first 6 months of 2015, which also reflects the loss on discontinued operations was $110 million or $0.17 per share compared with reported earnings of $545 million or $0.83 per share for the same period in 2014.
Adjusting for special items including results from discontinued operations, second quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.49 per share, up 11% from second quarter 2014 adjusted results. An year-to-date on going earnings of $1.26 per share is 15% higher in 2014.
As you will see on Slide 12, because of the strong performance of our utility here to-date, primarily in the U.S. and Kentucky, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 earnings forecast by $0.05. That increases the midpoint to $2.20 per share and 8.4% increase from our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. For the full year, we've seen improvement in our U.K. Regulated segments as a results of lower depreciation expense, partially offset by the cost incurred to reprise some of the 2015 foreign currency hedges and lower operating and maintenance expense coupled with support of weather in our Kentucky regulated segment.
Now lets turn to Slide 13 for an operational update. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities continues to meet with various state and federal agencies regarding its purposed regional transmission project and the study potential options for the transmission line. The project announced in the July 2014 would involve construction of a new multistate transmission line that would improved electric service reliability, enhance security and provide cost savings to millions of consumers in the PJM and New York regions. We will continue to provide updates as this project moves further along.
Also in Pennsylvania, we're awaiting a decision from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on PPL Electric Utilities request to replace it's 1.4 million electric meters with new more advanced meters. The company has proposed replacing its meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state mandated regulations on metering technology, estimated to cost about $450 million, of which $328 million is expected is increase rate base. A PUC administrative law judge has recommended approval of that plan. In addition, PPL Electric Utilities March 31 Distribution rate case remains pending before the Pennsylvania PUC. As part of this regulatory process, the company is engaged in ongoing settlement discussions with parties. We'll of course keep you updated as the case proceeds. The company has requested an increase of $167.5 million in annual pace distribution revenues. The request is driven by continued investments required to renew, strength and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution network.
We've already seen significant improvement in system reliability based on the investments made to date as we're experiencing 38% fewer outages than 5 years ago, and the average length of time our customer are without power has been reduced by 43%. The investment being requested in this rate case is expected to further improve system reliability by another 20% over the next 5 years. We expect the revenue increase to take effect January 1, 2016.
In Kentucky, the Kentucky PUC in late June issued final orders that resulted in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates -- gas and electric. The new rates became effective July 1 as anticipated. And after more than 2 years and over $2 million construction hours, the new $530 million 640-megawatt run unit 7 combined cycle gas plant is now commercially available.
This unit is the first of its kind in the state and represents our commitment to put resources in place to meet the future energy needs of our customers. Since the start of the operations, the unit has been as a base load unit.
Finally, our WPD subsidiaries in U.K. transition to the new 8-year price control period, RIIO-ED1 on April 1, 2015. While it's only been a few months under RIIO-ED1, so far we're performing very well and either meeting or exceeding our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince to provide a more detailed look at our financial performance. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 15 for a review of segment earnings. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. regulated segment and lower cost in corporate and other resulting from the corporate restructuring efforts, which are essentially complete.
As Bill mentioned earlier, PPL's reported earnings for the quarter and year-to-date reflected losses from discontinued operations associated with the June 1 spin-off our of our competitive supply business. The accounting rules required us to evaluate whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than our carrying value as of the June 1 spin-off date, and we determinated that it was. This resulted in a loss on spin of $875 million. In addition to the loss on spin, supply's operating results and all costs associated with the spin are classified on the income statement as discontinued operations for our current and prior periods. You can find additional details on the spin-off, our evaluation methodologies used in determining our estimated fair value for supply and information on our Transition Services Agreement with Talen in our second quarter 10-Q that we are filing today.
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the second quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and compared to the 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was flat to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the second quarter.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 16. Now Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.01 per share compared with the year ago. This result was due to higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset addition, partially offset by higher margins from additional transmission investments.
Moving Slide 17, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.09 per share in the second quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, offset by higher O&M expenses related to cost for the retirement of the -- cold facility.
Moving to Slide 18. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2015, a $0.03 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes from a lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014, and Lower depreciation expense from the asset life expansion we discussed last quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transition to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year and the FX from foreign currency.
Moving to Slide 19. On this slide, will provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. As you can see, we continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.58.  For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage from 72% at the end of the first quarter to 90% today at an average rate of $1.61. We also continue to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we're now 40% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.62, up from the 20% we reported in the first quarter. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in '16 and about $0.03 of exposure in 2017, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is $1.55. Also on the slide, we have updated our RPI sensitivity. As we discussed last quarter, under the REO methodology, our revenues for the 2015-'16 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in 2017-'18 were reflected true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015, '16 regulatory year. Current RPI forecast using the HM treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest the 2015, '16 inflation rate of about 1.8% compared to the 2.6% included in our revenue. We are providing a sensitivity for 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-'16 period, RPI forecast for 2016 and beyond continue to be either above or at or soon 3%.
RPI effects 3 primary drivers for WPD: our revenues; our O&M expenses; and the interest expense on index linked debt. For 2017, since it's the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, the 2015-'16 RPI of 50 basis points below our budgeted range or an RPI of about 2.1% would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017. As noted in the footnote, we updated the sensitivity to include the partial O&M and interest expense offsets in the sensitivity.
Let's move to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks, we have announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. We have received several questions regarding our ability to fund and continue to grow our dividend during this period of high CapEx pending. We're providing a new disclosure this quarter, which presents how we view our domestic cash flow picture. We start with our domestic cash from operations and subtract the domestic maintenance CapEx as represented by depreciation expense. We than add the cash distributions we receive from the U.K. And as you can see in the table, we have sufficient domestic cash flows to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend. So the debt and equity issuances in the U.S. are funding our domestic growth CapEx in ongoing debt maturities. From a cash perspective, we believe this is the appropriate way to look at it since the U.K. is a completely self-funding business.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I'd like to reiterate Bill's comments that we are confident in our ability to achieve our stated 4% to 6% earnings growth target to at least 2017. This growth directly reflects our robust capital expenditure plan combined with very constructive regulator structures at significantly reduced regulatory lag driving an expected 8% to 10% EPS growth at our domestic utility. That level of growth combined with lower corporate and other costs, which will add an additional 2% earnings growth over this period, more than offsets the relatively flat earnings growth profile expected from the U.K. during the period.
We continue to believe the U.K. is a premium jurisdiction given an 8-year rate cycle with revenue and index to inflation and an incentive-based model that given our historical best -- performance, provides us the opportunity to continue to earn very strong ROEs in the U.K., expected to be in the mid- to upper teens through 2017. We also believe our common stock dividend is not only very competitive, but very secure and poised for future growth.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Now, I turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?"

And I think in PPL's case, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do have the program, a project, which is obviously a fairly large chunk of transmission spend that potentially start to come in to our capital plans post 2017. So we will continue to monitor that specific project than any of the transmission projects as we go forward. So I think those would be kind of the key drivers, Dan."

I think we have in place the regulator structures to allow us to recover the cause. We were looking at a power plant that we're going to put in place in 2018. We've delayed that a little bit. We still have -- we know where we want to put it. We know what a transmission would be. And those are kind of some of the options we would look at. We have a very favorable DSM program and recovery. If we have to accelerate that we can. So I think we have the regulator tools to accommodate, but until I see the final. we see the final requirements today, it's hard for us to comment definitively, but we do have a good relationship with our commission.

We're pleased that you joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the presidents of our 3 business segments.Moving to Slide 3.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the presidents of our 3 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. You'll see an agenda for today's discussion. As we typically do, we'll provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results, which I'm pleased to say includes significant growth in earnings from ongoing operations. We'll discuss our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are increasing along with our dividend, based on the continued strong performance of our utilities, and I'll provide an operational overview as well. Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. And as always, we'll have plenty of time to answer your questions.
But before we dive into the quarterly results, I'd like to share with you my thoughts about the new PPL. As you know, June 1 marked a major milestone in our company's history. On that day, we completed the spin-off of our competitive Supply business. And in doing so, we completed a strategic transformation of PPL that began with our acquisition of 2 regulated utilities in Kentucky, followed by the expansion of our utility operations in the United Kingdom. It's a transformation that has been exceptionally well executed, provides earnings and dividend growth potential, will create significant value for our shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success. Today, in our first earnings call since the spin-off of the Supply segment, our focus has never been clearer. Our ability to control our own destiny through proven track record of execution has never been greater. And I, without a doubt, have never been more excited about where we're headed.
Moving to Slide 4. Let me expand on some of the reasons why. PPL is now a pure-play, regulated utility investment, made up of 7 high-performing award-winning and growing utility companies. Year in and year out, these utilities prove themselves to be among the best in our industry. They're diverse and located in different regions with different regulatory structures. They offer a mix of regulated assets you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in our sector. Each utility operates in what we consider to be a premium jurisdiction. In addition, all of our utilities are investing heavily in infrastructure, producing robust rate base growth for PPL.
In fact, organic growth in our domestic utilities is amongst the strongest in the U.S. utility sector, with 8% to 10% earnings growth expected through 2017. We expect our combined rate base in the U.S. alone to grow by 47% over the next 5 years. That's the equivalent of adding another major utility to our portfolio. Our balance sheet is strong and so our cash flows, credit ratings and very competitive dividend. The bottom line, we believe the new PPL with its strong growth profile, a solid dividend and a diverse mix of holdings, is a unique and very compelling investment option in the U.S. Utilities Sector.
Looking at Slide 5, you can see that robust rate base growth combined with jurisdictions that permit near real-time recovery of our infrastructure investments is what will drive our targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. I want to point out that the 2017 $2.35 of earnings per share shown here represents a projection based on the midpoint of our 4% to 6% compound annual growth target off our 2014 adjusted earnings. It does not represent earnings guidance for 2017. Across the portfolio, over $10 billion in CapEx spending is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of more than 7% or $5 billion by the end of 2017. For 2015 through 2017, over 80% of that CapEx earns a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than 6 months. This combination creates a very strong foundation for future earnings growth.
Let's turn to Slide 6. This slide offers additional detail on why we feel our U.S. operations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky operate in constructive regulatory environments. Domestically, we have favorable allowed ROEs in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. When coupled with the numerous recovery mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag, including the DSIC in Pennsylvania and the ECR in Kentucky, we're well positioned to achieve our earnings growth targets. 
We have excellent growth in transmission with allowed base ROEs of 11.68% to the FERC formula rate, a 12.93% allowed ROE for the $630 million Susquehanna-Roseland project as well as a return on CWIP for the $335 million Northeast/Pocono Reliability project in Pennsylvania. It's this list of trackers and recovery mechanisms that drive the rapid recovery I described on the prior slide of 76% of our CapEx earning return in less than 6 months and over 80% earning return in less than 12 months.
Turning to Slide 7. We provide a more detailed look at why we also believe the U.K. offers a superior regulatory jurisdiction. The RIIO-ED1 framework in the U.K. provides long-term inflation-adjusted rate certainty without volumetric exposure, and Ofgem has accepted our business plans, which include total spend of over $19 billion over the 8-year regulatory period. About $11 billion of that spend will drive growth in our regulated asses value or RAV. It also offers the potential to outperform through performance incentives, which as you know, WPD has been very successful at earning in the past. And it offers us the opportunity to earn an adjusted expected return on equity in the mid- to upper teens through 2017.
We're uniquely positioned with our history of strong performance and innovation to earn these favorable returns in this premium jurisdiction. Our utilities in the U.K. are the 4 best performers in the country. They were the only utilities to be approved for fast tracking of their business plans under REO. This enables them to collect additional revenue of about $43 million annually, and retain 70% of cost efficiencies compared to about 55% for the slow-track DNOs. And the U.K. business is self-funding and does not require any equity from PPL. In fact, we have the flexibility to dividend between $300 million and $500 million of cash back to the U.S. annually in a tax-efficient manner.
Turning to Slide 8, our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend raising it from $1.49 to $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 13th dividend increase in 14 years. The quarterly dividend of $0.3775 per share will be payable October 1 to shareowners of record as of September 10. The increase in the dividend is consistent with our prior messaging that we would look to raise the dividend after the completion of the spin.
Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 4% to 6% earnings growth targets through at least 2017. We expect 8% to 10% growth in our domestic utility earnings, and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring efforts, which combined, are more than offsetting relatively flat earnings expectations in our U.K. business over this time period.
There are several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utilities, and these include strong transmission rate base growth of 18.9% through 2017 in Pennsylvania, limited volumetric risk in our distribution operation in Pennsylvania due to our rate structures and recovery mechanisms, environmental spending and favorable rate case outcomes contribute to our growth in Kentucky. And outside the U.S., the U.K. spending program of $4.8 billion along with our projected incentive return, support our overall RAV growth and strong financial performance. 
Before turning to our quarterly results, I want to reiterate how optimistic I am about PPL's future. I believe PPL's diverse list of assets, our low overall business and regulatory risk and our proven track record of earnings performance and transparency set us apart from our peers. It's a new day for PPL, but we'll continue to deliver for our customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 11, today we reported a second quarter 2015 loss of $757 million or $1.13 per share. This reflects $1 billion loss or $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business. The loss from discontinued operations included an $879 million loss reflecting the fair value of the Supply business at the time of the spin-off compared to the recorded value of the segment. Vince will address the loss from discontinued operations in more detail in his remarks. By comparison, second quarter 2014 reported earnings were $229 million or $0.34 per share. 
The reported loss for the first 6 months of 2015, which also reflects the loss on discontinued operations, was $110 million or $0.17 per share compared with reported earnings of $545 million or $0.83 per share for the same period in 2014. Adjusting for special items, including results from discontinued operations, second quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.49 per share, up 11% from second quarter 2014 adjusted results. And year-to-date ongoing earnings of $1.26 per share is 15% higher in 2014.
As you will see's on Slide 12, because of the strong performance of our utility year-to-date, primarily in the U.S. and Kentucky, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 earnings forecast by $0.05. That increases the midpoint to $2.20 per share, an 8.4% increase from our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. For the full year, we see an improvement in our U.K. Regulated segment as a result of lower depreciation expense, partially offset by the cost incurred to reprice some of the 2015 foreign currency hedges and lower operating and maintenance expense coupled with support of weather in our Kentucky Regulated segment.
Now lets turn to Slide 13 for an operational update. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities continues to meet with various state and federal agencies regarding its proposed Compass regional transmission project and to study potential options for the transmission line. The project announced in the July 2014 would involve construction of a new multistate transmission line that would improve electric service reliability, enhance grid security and provide cost savings to millions of consumers in the PJM and New York ISO regions. We will continue to provide updates as this project moves further along.
Also in Pennsylvania, we're awaiting a decision from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on PPL Electric Utilities' request to replace it's 1.4 million electric meters with new, more advanced meters. The company has proposed replacing its meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state-mandated regulations on metering technology, estimated to cost about $450 million, of which $328 million is expected is to increase rate base. A PUC administrative law judge has recommended approval of that plan. In addition, PPL Electric Utilities' March 31 distribution rate case remains pending before the Pennsylvania PUC. As part of this regulatory process, the company is engaged in ongoing settlement discussions with the parties. We'll, of course, keep you updated as the case proceeds. 
The company has requested an increase of $167.5 million in annual base distribution revenues. The request is driven by continued investments required to renew, strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution network.
We've already seen significant improvement in system reliability based on the investments made to date, as we're experiencing 38% fewer outages than 5 years ago, and the average length of time our customers are without power has been reduced by 43%. The investment being requested in this rate case is expected to further improve system reliability by another 20% over the next 5 years. We expect the revenue increase to take effect January 1 of 2016.
In Kentucky, the Kentucky PUC in late June issued final orders that resulted in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky Utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at Louisville Gas and Electric Company. The new rates became effective July 1 as anticipated. And after more than 2 years and over $2 million construction hours, the new $530 million 640-megawatt Cane Run Unit 7 combined-cycle gas plant is now commercially available. This unit is the first of its kind in the state and represents our commitment to put resources in place to meet the future energy needs of our customers. Since the start of the operations, the unit has been running as a base load unit.
Finally, our WPD subsidiaries in U.K. transitioned to the new 8-year price control period, RIIO-ED1, on April 1, 2015. While it's only been a few months under RIIO-ED1, so far we're performing very well and either meeting or exceeding our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince to provide a more detailed look at our financial performance. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 15 for a review of segment earnings. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regula",1212,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 15 for a review of segment earnings. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment and lower cost in Corporate and Other resulting from the corporate restructuring efforts, which are essentially complete.
As Bill mentioned earlier, PPL's reported earnings for the quarter and year-to-date reflected losses from discontinued operations associated with the June 1 spin-off our of our competitive Supply business. The accounting rules required us to evaluate whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than our carrying value as of the June 1 spin-off date, and we determinated that it was. This resulted in a loss on spin of $875 million. In addition to the loss on spin, Supply's operating results and all costs associated with the spin are classified on the income statement as discontinued operations for all current and prior periods. You can find additional details on the spin-off, our evaluation methodologies used in determining our estimated fair value for Supply and information on our Transition Services Agreements with Talen in our second quarter 10-Q that we are filing today.
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the second quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and compared to the 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was flat to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the second quarter.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 16. Now Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.01 per share compared with the year ago. This result was due to higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions, partially offset by higher margins from additional transmission investments.
Moving to Slide 17. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.09 per share in the second quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, offset by higher O&M expenses related to costs for the retirement of the Cane Run coal facility.
Moving to Slide 18. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2015, a $0.03 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes from the lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed last quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transition to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year and the effects from foreign currency.
Moving to Slide 19. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. As you can see, we continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.58. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage from 72% at the end of the first quarter to 90% today at an average rate of $1.61. We also continue to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we are now 40% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.62, up from the 20% we reported in the first quarter. You can see from the sensitivity table that there's basically no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in '16 and about $0.03 of exposure in 2017, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is $1.55. 
Also on this slide, we have updated our RPI sensitivity. As we discussed last quarter, under the REO methodology, our revenues for the 2015-'16 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in 2017-'18 will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015-'16 regulatory year. Current RPI forecast using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest the 2015, '16 inflation rate of about 1.8% compared to the 2.6% included in our revenue. We are providing a sensitivity for 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-'16 period, RPI forecast for 2016 and beyond continue to be either above or at our assumed 3%.
RPI affects 3 primary drivers for WPD: our revenues; our O&M expenses; and the interest expense on index-linked debt. For 2017, since this is the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, a 2015-'16 RPI of 50 basis points below our budgeted range, or an RPI of about 2.1%, would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017. As noted in the footnote, we updated the sensitivity to include the partial O&M and interest expense offsets in the sensitivity.
Let's move to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks, we have announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. We have received several questions regarding our ability to fund and continue to grow our dividend during this period of high CapEx pending. We're providing a new disclosure this quarter, which presents how we view our domestic cash flow picture. We start with our domestic cash from operations and subtract the domestic maintenance CapEx, as represented by depreciation expense. We than add the cash distributions we receive from the U.K. And as you can see in the table, we have sufficient domestic cash flows to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend. So the debt and equity issuances in the U.S. are funding our domestic growth CapEx and ongoing debt maturities. From a cash perspective, we believe this is the appropriate way to look at it since the U.K. is a completely self-funding business.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I'd like to reiterate Bill's comments that we are confident in our ability to achieve our stated 4% to 6% earnings growth target to at least 2017. This growth directly reflects our robust capital expenditure plan, combined with very constructive regulatory structures and significantly reduced regulatory lag driving an expected 8% to 10% EPS growth at our domestic utility. That level of growth combined with lower Corporate and Other costs, which will add an additional 2% earnings growth over this period, more than offsets the relatively flat earnings growth profile expected from the U.K. during the period.
We continue to believe the U.K. is a premium jurisdiction given an 8-year rate cycle with revenue and RAV index to inflation and an incentive-based model that given our historical ""best in the sector"" performance, provides us the opportunity to continue to earn very strong ROEs in the U.K., expected to be in the mid- to upper teens through 2017. We also believe our common stock dividend is not only very competitive, but very secure and poised for future growth.
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?"

I think in Kentucky, we'll need to study it a little bit more closely to kind of see what the impact on our Kentucky operations might be. When I think -- going beyond 2017, clearly we're going to look to incorporate whatever we may need to do to respond to the Clean Power Plan. And I think in PPL's case, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do have the Compass program, a project, which is obviously a fairly large chunk of transmission spend that potentially start to come in to our capital plans post-2017. So we'll continue to monitor that specific project and any other transmission projects as we go forward. So I think those would be kind of the key drivers, Dan."

We still have -- we know where we want to put it. We know what the transmission would be. And those are kind of some of the options we would look at. We have a very favorable DSM program and recovery. If we have to accelerate that, we can. So I think we have the regulatory tools to accommodate it, but until I see the final -- we see the final requirements today, it's hard for us to comment definitively.

So yes, what happened was, we need to do an estimate of fair value at the date of spin and then compare that to the book value. And what we did what we used a combination of 3 different valuation methodologies, basically 2 market approaches and 1 income approach, which is a discounted cash flow approach. One of the market approaches was the use of the Talen market value of their equity as of the spin-off date, which was the last day, as you know, of their when-issued trading period. And so that number -- and we weighed it about 50% weighting to that because it was publicly available information. And that was a lower number than we were expecting to end up at the end of when issued. So that, I think, drove some of the decrease in fair value, say since year-end. And then just power prices have come off in PJM. So I think when you look at the DCF, that was lower and the market approach was lower than what we were expecting combined, resulted in about a $3.2 billion fair value against the $4.1 billion book value."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our 3 business segments.
Moving to Slide 3. You'll see an agenda for today's discussion. As we typically do, we'll provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results, which I'm pleased to say includes significant growth in earnings from ongoing operations. We'll discuss our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are increasing along with our dividend, based on the continued strong performance of our utilities, and I'll provide an operational overview as well. Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. And as always, we'll have plenty of time to answer your questions.
But before we dive into the quarterly results, I'd like to share with you my thoughts about the new PPL. As you know, June 1 marked a major milestone in our company's history. On that day, we completed the spin-off of our competitive Supply business. And in doing so, we completed a strategic transformation of PPL that began with our acquisition of 2 regulated utilities in Kentucky, followed by the expansion of our utility operations in the United Kingdom. It's a transformation that has been exceptionally well executed, provides earnings and dividend growth potential, will create significant value for our shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success. Today, in our first earnings call since the spin-off of the Supply segment, our focus has never been clearer. Our ability to control our own destiny through proven track record of execution has never been greater. And I, without a doubt, have never been more excited about where we're headed.
Moving to Slide 4. Let me expand on some of the reasons why. PPL is now a pure-play, regulated utility investment, made up of 7 high-performing award-winning and growing utility companies. Year in and year out, these utilities prove themselves to be among the best in our industry. They're diverse and located in different regions with different regulatory structures. They offer a mix of regulated assets you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in our sector. Each utility operates in what we consider to be a premium jurisdiction. In addition, all of our utilities are investing heavily in infrastructure, producing robust rate base growth for PPL.
In fact, organic growth in our domestic utilities is among the strongest in the U.S. utility sector, with 8% to 10% earnings growth expected through 2017. We expect our combined rate base in the U.S. alone to grow by 47% over the next 5 years. That's the equivalent of adding another major utility to our portfolio. Our balance sheet is strong and so are our cash flows, credit ratings and very competitive dividend. The bottom line, we believe the new PPL with its strong growth profile, a solid dividend and a diverse mix of holdings, is a unique and very compelling investment option in the U.S. Utilities Sector.
Looking at Slide 5, you can see that robust rate base growth combined with jurisdictions that permit near real-time recovery of our infrastructure investments is what will drive our targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. I want to point out that the 2017 $2.35 of earnings per share shown here represents a projection based on the midpoint of our 4% to 6% compound annual growth target off our 2014 adjusted earnings. It does not represent earnings guidance for 2017. Across the portfolio, over $10 billion in CapEx spending is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of more than 7% or $5 billion by the end of 2017. For 2015 through 2017, over 80% of that CapEx earns a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than 6 months. This combination creates a very strong foundation for future earnings growth.
Let's turn to Slide 6. This slide offers additional detail on why we feel our U.S. operations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky operate in constructive regulatory environments. Domestically, we have favorable allowed ROEs in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. When coupled with the numerous recovery mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag, including the DSIC in Pennsylvania and the ECR in Kentucky, we're well positioned to achieve our earnings growth targets. 
We have excellent growth in transmission with allowed base ROEs of 11.68% to the FERC formula rate, and a 12.93% allowed ROE for the $630 million Susquehanna-Roseland project as well as a return on CWIP for the $335 million Northeast/Pocono Reliability project in Pennsylvania. It's this list of trackers and recovery mechanisms that drive the rapid recovery I described on the prior slide of 76% of our CapEx earning return in less than 6 months and over 80% earning return in less than 12 months.
Turning to Slide 7. We provide a more detailed look at why we also believe the U.K. offers a superior regulatory jurisdiction. The RIIO-ED1 framework in the U.K. provides long-term inflation-adjusted rate certainty without volumetric exposure, and Ofgem has accepted our business plans, which include total spend of over $19 billion over the 8-year regulatory period. About $11 billion of that spend will drive growth in our regulated asset value or RAV. It also offers the potential to outperform through performance incentives, which as you know, WPD has been very successful at earning in the past. And it offers us the opportunity to earn an adjusted expected return on equity in the mid- to upper teens through 2017.
We're uniquely positioned with our history of strong performance and innovation to earn these favorable returns in this premium jurisdiction. Our utilities in the U.K. are the 4 best performers in the country. They were the only utilities to be approved for fast tracking of their business plans under RIIO. This enables them to collect additional revenue of about $43 million annually, and retain 70% of cost efficiencies compared to about 55% for the slow-track DNOs. And the U.K. business is self-funding and does not require any equity from PPL. In fact, we have the flexibility to dividend between $300 million and $500 million of cash back to the U.S. annually in a tax-efficient manner.
Turning to Slide 8, our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend, raising it from $1.49 to $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 13th dividend increase in 14 years. The quarterly dividend of $0.3775 per share will be payable October 1 to shareowners of record as of September 10. The increase in the dividend is consistent with our prior messaging that we would look to raise the dividend after the completion of the spin.
Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 4% to 6% earnings growth targets through at least 2017. We expect 8% to 10% growth in our domestic utility earnings, and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring efforts, which combined, are more than offsetting relatively flat earnings expectations in our U.K. business over this time period.
There are several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utilities, and these include strong transmission rate base growth of 18.9% through 2017 in Pennsylvania, limited volumetric risk in our distribution operation in Pennsylvania due to our rate structures and recovery mechanisms, environmental spending and favorable rate case outcomes contribute to our growth in Kentucky. And outside the U.S., the U.K. spending program of $4.8 billion along with our projected incentive return, support our overall RAV growth and strong financial performance. 
Before turning to our quarterly results, I want to reiterate how optimistic I am about PPL's future. I believe PPL's diverseness of assets, our low overall business and regulatory risk and our proven track record of earnings performance and transparency set us apart from our peers. It's a new day for PPL, but we'll continue to deliver for our customers and our shareowners.
Turning to Slide 11, today we reported a second quarter 2015 loss of $757 million or $1.13 per share. This reflects $1 billion loss or $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business. The loss from discontinued operations included an $879 million loss reflecting the fair value of the Supply business at the time of the spin-off compared to the recorded value of the segment. Vince will address the loss from discontinued operations in more detail in his remarks. By comparison, second quarter 2014 reported earnings were $229 million or $0.34 per share. 
The reported loss for the first 6 months of 2015, which also reflects the loss on discontinued operations, was $110 million or $0.17 per share compared with reported earnings of $545 million or $0.83 per share for the same period in 2014. Adjusting for special items, including results from discontinued operations, second quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.49 per share, up 11% from second quarter 2014 adjusted results. And year-to-date ongoing earnings of $1.26 per share is 15% higher than 2014.
As you will see on Slide 12, because of the strong performance of our utilities year-to-date, primarily in the U.K. and Kentucky, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 earnings forecast by $0.05. That increases the midpoint to $2.20 per share, an 8.4% increase from our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. For the full year, we see an improvement in our U.K. Regulated segment as a result of lower depreciation expense, partially offset by the cost incurred to reprice some of the 2015 foreign currency hedges and lower operating and maintenance expense coupled with supportive weather in our Kentucky Regulated segment.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for an operational update. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities continues to meet with various state and federal agencies regarding its proposed Compass regional transmission project and to study potential options for the transmission line. The project announced in the July 2014 would involve construction of a new multistate transmission line that would improve electric service reliability, enhance grid security and provide cost savings to millions of consumers in the PJM and New York ISO regions. We will continue to provide updates as this project moves further along.
Also in Pennsylvania, we're awaiting a decision from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on PPL Electric Utilities' request to replace its 1.4 million electric meters with new, more advanced meters. The company has proposed replacing its meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state-mandated regulations on metering technology, estimated to cost about $450 million, of which $328 million is expected is to increase rate base. A PUC administrative law judge has recommended approval of that plan. In addition, PPL Electric Utilities' March 31 distribution rate case remains pending before the Pennsylvania PUC. As part of this regulatory process, the company is engaged in ongoing settlement discussions with the parties. We'll, of course, keep you updated as the case proceeds. 
The company has requested an increase of $167.5 million in annual base distribution revenues. The request is driven by continued investments required to renew, strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution network.
We've already seen significant improvement in system reliability based on the investments made to date, as we're experiencing 38% fewer outages than 5 years ago, and the average length of time our customers are without power has been reduced by 43%. The investment being requested in this rate case is expected to further improve system reliability by another 20% over the next 5 years. We expect the revenue increase to take effect January 1 of 2016.
In Kentucky, the Kentucky PUC in late June issued final orders that resulted in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky Utilities, and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at Louisville Gas and Electric. The new rates became effective July 1 as anticipated. And after more than 2 years and over 2 million construction hours, the new $530 million 640-megawatt Cane Run Unit 7 combined-cycle gas plant is now commercially available. This unit is the first of its kind in the state and represents our commitment to put resources in place to meet the future energy needs of our customers. Since the start of the operations, the unit has been running as a base load unit.
Finally, our WPD subsidiaries in U.K. transitioned to the new 8-year price control period, RIIO-ED1, on April 1, 2015. While it's only been a few months under RIIO-ED1, so far we're performing very well and either meeting or exceeding our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince to provide a more detailed look at our financial performance. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 15 for a review of segment earnings. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment and lower cost in Corporate and Other resulting from the corporate restructuring efforts, which are essentially complete.
As Bill mentioned earlier, PPL's reported earnings for the quarter and year-to-date reflected losses from discontinued operations associated with the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business. The accounting rules required us to evaluate whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than our carrying value as of the June 1 spin-off date, and we determined that it was. This resulted in a loss on spin of $875 million. In addition to the loss on spin, Supply's operating results and all costs associated with the spin are classified on the income statement as discontinued operations for all current and prior periods. You can find additional details on the spin-off, our evaluation methodologies used in determining our estimated fair value for Supply and information on our Transition Services Agreements with Talen in our second quarter 10-Q that we are filing today.
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the second quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and compared to the 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was flat to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the second quarter.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 16. Now Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.01 per share compared with the year ago. This result was due to higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions, partially offset by higher margins from additional transmission investments.
Moving to Slide 17. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.09 per share in the second quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, offset by higher O&M expenses related to costs for the retirement of the Cane Run coal facility.
Moving to Slide 18. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2015, a $0.03 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes from the lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed last quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transition to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year and the effects from foreign currency.
Moving to Slide 19. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16 and '17, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. As you can see, we continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.58. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage from 72% at the end of the first quarter to 90% today at an average rate of $1.61. We also continue to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter, and we are now 40% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.62, up from the 20% we reported in the first quarter. You can see from the sensitivity table that there's basically no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in '16 and about $0.03 of exposure in 2017, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is $1.55. 
Also on this slide, we have updated our RPI sensitivity. As we discussed last quarter, under the RIIO methodology, our revenues for the 2015-'16 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in 2017-'18 will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015-'16 regulatory year. Current RPI forecast using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest the 2015, '16 inflation rate of about 1.8% compared to the 2.6% included in our revenue. We are providing a sensitivity for 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-'16 period, RPI forecasts for 2016 and beyond continue to be either above or at our assumed 3%.
RPI affects 3 primary drivers for WPD: our revenues; our O&M expenses; and the interest expense on index-linked debt. For 2017, since this is the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, a 2015-'16 RPI of 50 basis points below our budgeted rate, or an RPI of about 2.1%, would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017. As noted in the footnote, we updated the sensitivity to include the partial O&M and interest expense offsets in the sensitivity.
Let's move to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks, we have announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. We have received several questions regarding our ability to fund and continue to grow our dividend during this period of high CapEx spending. We're providing a new disclosure this quarter, which presents how we view our domestic cash flow picture. We start with our domestic cash from operations and subtract the domestic maintenance CapEx, as represented by depreciation expense. We than add the cash distributions we receive from the U.K. And as you can see in the table, we have sufficient domestic cash flows to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend. So the debt and equity issuances in the U.S. are funding our domestic growth CapEx and ongoing debt maturities. From a cash perspective, we believe this is the appropriate way to look at it since the U.K. is a completely self-funding business.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I'd like to reiterate Bill's comments that we are confident in our ability to achieve our stated 4% to 6% earnings growth target through at least 2017. This growth directly reflects our robust capital expenditure plan, combined with very constructive regulatory structures, that significantly reduce regulatory lag, driving an expected 8% to 10% EPS growth at our domestic utilities. That level of growth combined with lower Corporate and Other costs, which will add an additional 2% earnings growth over this period, more than offsets the relatively flat earnings growth profile expected from the U.K. during the period.
We continue to believe the U.K. is a premium jurisdiction given an 8-year rate cycle with revenue and RAV indexed to inflation and an incentive-based model that given our historical ""best in the sector"" performance, provides us the opportunity to continue to earn very strong ROEs in the U.K., expected to be in the mid- to upper teens through 2017. We also believe our common stock dividend is not only very competitive, but very secure and poised for future growth.
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?"

When I think -- going beyond 2017, clearly we're going to look to incorporate whatever we may need to do to respond to the Clean Power Plan. And I think in PPL's case, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do have the Compass program, or project, which is obviously a fairly large chunk of transmission spend that potentially start to come in to our capital plans post-2017. So we'll continue to monitor that specific project and any other transmission projects as we go forward. So I think those would be kind of the key drivers, Dan."

We still have -- we know where we want to put it. We know what the transmission would be. And those are kind of some of the options we would look at. We have a very favorable DSM program and recovery. If we have to accelerate that, we can.

So yes, what happened was, we need to do an estimate of fair value at the date of spin and then compare that to the book value. And what we did was we used a combination of 3 different valuation methodologies, basically 2 market approaches and 1 income approach, which is a discounted cash flow approach. One of the market approaches was the use of the Talen market value of their equity as of the spin-off date, which was the last day, as you know, of their when-issued trading period. And so that number -- and we weighed it about 50% weighting to that because it was publicly available information. And that was a lower number than we were expecting to end up at the end of when issued. So that, I think, drove some of the decrease in fair value, say since year-end. And then just power prices have come off in PJM. So I think when you look at the DCF, that was lower and the market approach was lower than what we were expecting combined, resulted in about a $3.2 billion fair value against the $4.1 billion book value."

Welcome to the call, Robert.
Moving to Slide 3. You'll see our agenda for today's discussion. We'll begin with an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results. We'll also address our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are reaffirming today. I'll provide an update to our earnings and dividend growth expectations through 2017, both of which we are increasing today. And I'll provide a brief operational overview for our U.S. utility. Then I'll turn the call over to Robert to review some new disclosures we're making this quarter to provide more transparency on our estimates for incentive revenues at WPD under the new RIIO model. Vince will then review our segment results and provide more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Before I jump into the earnings details, however, let me tell you briefly where we stand with 3 quarters of the year behind us. Based on the solid year-to-date results, our plans for about $10 billion in infrastructure investments through 2017 and higher expected earnings from our U.K. operations, we're now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. We continue to execute well and we're confident in our growth plans. The Company had previously projected 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our business plan is low risk and we are confident in our ability to execute the plan and deliver on our commitments. 
Moving to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2015 reported earnings of $393 million or $0.58 a share, a decrease from $497 million or $0.74 per share a year ago. Year-to-date reported earnings were $283 million or $0.42 per share compared with $1.4 -- $1.04 billion or a $1.57 per share through the same period in 2014. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflect a $915 million loss or $1.36 per share from discontinued operations resulting primarily from the June 1 spinoff of our competitive Supply business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.51 per share, up 16% from third quarter 2014 adjusted results. Through the first 9 months 2015, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.77%, up 15% from year ago. 
Moving to Slide 5, driven by the strong performance of our fully regulated portfolio, today, we are reaffirming our 2015 forecast range for earnings from ongoing operations of $2.15 per share to $2.25 per share. If you've tracked us closely through the years, as I know many of you have, you know that we have a strong track record of not just meeting, but exceeding earnings targets. And as I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. This increase is driven primarily by higher expected earnings from our regulated operations in the U.K. driven primarily by higher expected incentive revenues and lower depreciation expense resulting from the change in depreciable lives. 
Robert will discuss the details of the higher incentive revenues in his prepared remarks. We now expect the U.K. earnings growth to be 1% to 2% through 2017, previously projected to be flat. And we expect 12% to 14% growth in domestic operations including our corporate services organization. 
Vince will provide an update on our U.K. earnings projections through 2016 in his prepared remarks. Our overall earnings growth is fueled by about $3.5 billion per year of capital investments in our existing infrastructure and service territories, combined with the constructive regulatory jurisdictions where we operate, which results in over 80% of our CapEx earning a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than 6 months. 
Regarding the dividend, we expect minimal dividend growth again for 2016 as we strive to get the payout ratio down into the mid- 60% range, at which time we will target a 4% to 6% dividend growth rate more in line with our earnings growth expectations. We currently expect to be in the targeted payout range by the end of 2016. So our current expectation is that we will grow the dividend more meaningfully starting in 2017, but our current expectation for 2017 is at the low end of the 4% to 6% relative to the dividend. We will expect to maintain at least that level of growth through 2017, but we will assess that when we get there. 
Turning to the operational overview on Slide 6. And beginning with the PPL Electric Utilities rate case. On September 30, we announced the settlement agreement that would provide PPL Electric Utilities an additional $124 million in revenue through a rate increase to be effective January 1, 2016. The settlement will help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. Earlier this month, an administrative law judge from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission recommended the commission approves this settlement. Action by the commission is expected later this year. The settlement is a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity. The agreement highlights the constructive relationships we have in the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work with a variety of parties to secure results that deliver both competitive returns to shareowners and significant benefits to customers. It's the second such settlement we've announced this year. Last quarter, we highlighted the Kentucky Public Service Commission's approval of rate increases for our Kentucky utilities following a successful settlement in those proceedings. In both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, we utilized forward test years, this further assists in our ability to reduce regulatory lag. Also, in September, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved PPL Electric Utilities request to invest $450 million in new, more advanced meters for its 1.4 million customers. The Company plans to replace its existing meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state mandated regulations on metering technology. Costs will be recovered with little-to-no regulatory lag through a special rider. The replacement is expected to increase rate base by about $330 million. In Pennsylvania, I'd also like to mention that PPL Electric Utilities received another J.D. Power Award for residential customer satisfaction. The Company ranked highest among large Electric Utilities in the Eastern United States. It is the fourth year in a row that the PPL Electric Utilities earned the distinction and the 12th overall in that category. The Company has now won 11 J.D. Power Awards for business customer satisfaction as well. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 7, before I move to Kentucky, PPL Electric Utilities took an important steps on its proposal to construct a major new transmission line called Project Compass. It's designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast. PPL Electric Utilities has filed an interconnection request within the New York Independent System Operator to build a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. The projected capital cost is expected to be $5 million to $600 million. This section or segment is designed to help make the electric grid more reliable and secure for customers throughout the region and provide substantial savings for New York consumers. If our interconnection request is approved by the New York ISO, additional approvals for the segment will be needed from the Pennsylvania PUC, the New York Public Service Commission, PJM and several other agencies. PPL Electric Utilities has extensive experience, as you know, in planning and building regional transmission lines. Just as past spring, we energized the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, which involved the planning, approval and construction of 101 miles of a 500-KV transmission line. On the Susquehanna-Roseland project, we demonstrated our ability to cooperate with multiple state and regulatory government agencies and the partner with a neighboring utility, which built an additional 50 miles of transmission line in New Jersey as part of that project. Expenditures for Project Compass are not included in our current capital projections. Our proposal currently calls for this first segment to be built and placed in service by 2023. While the first segment can stand alone has a valuable grid improvement, we continue to evaluate and refine the overall plan for the rest of Project Compass. 
As currently envisioned and based on preliminary estimates, Project Compass in its entirety would extend about 475 miles from Western Pennsylvania into Southeastern New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
If you turn to Slide 8, you will see the portion of the transmission line that represents the first segment between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. 
Shifting South to Kentucky. We retired the final 2 generating units at our Green River station on September 30. This marks the completion of our plan to retire 800 megawatts of coal-fired generation in Kentucky. We also continue to analyze the potential impact that the Clean Power Plan could have on our Kentucky operations. The precise impact is difficult to pin down at this point. The final rule is just published last Friday, October 23, and the final impact of the rule will note not be known until the state implementation plan or the state's specific federal implementation plan has been developed. The final rule is already being legally challenged, so this could have an impact as well. In the end, we will develop a plan for our facilities in collaboration with the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the state energy and environment cabinet. And investment required to comply with the Clean Power Plan would be incremental to our current CapEx plan. I would now like to turn the call over to Robert Symons, CEO of our U.K. operations. He will walk through us new disclosures on incentive revenues under RIIO-ED1. Robert?"

We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. Moving to Slide 10.

We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. 
Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new disclosures to review our current performance. But before we get into the performance details, I'd like to provide some background on the incentive framework. WPD has a long history of operational excellence. And we expect that to continue into RIIO-ED1. Our ability to execute on our plans and achieve incentive revenue has been key to our financial performance. And once again, WPD is on track to outperform its Ofgem targets in the 2015/2016 regulatory year. And WPD now expects to earn total incentive revenues that exceed prior estimates for '17 and '18. 
Our original plan is between $80 million and $100 million for 2017 and between $60 million and $90 million for 2018. Based on our performance to date, we're raising guidance estimates for the 2017 calendar year to $90 million to $110 million and $75 million to $105 million for 2018. One of the real benefits of being fast-track through price control review process is that we have more time to ensure we were in a strong position to deliver the output included in the business plans submitted to Ofgem. For example, in advance of the RIIO-ED1 period, we adjusted 1 of our operational targets to less than 12 hours for supply restoration, down from 18 hours, to align our performance with the new guaranteed standards in RIIO-ED1. The fast-track award of about $43 million per year during RIIO-ED1 period along with our ability to earn incentive revenues are 2 very strong reasons that the U.K. Regulatory model is considered a premium jurisdiction. 
Turning to Slide 11. The primary schemes that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost. Both of these schemes are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and the duration of power outages. The targets under RIIO-ED1 are specified in our licenses and become slightly more demanding each year. On this slide, you'll find results for customer minutes lost on the top left of the slide and customer interruptions on the top right. Customer minutes lost measures the cumulative amount of minutes customers are without electricity. In this chart, we are reporting the cumulative average performance of all 4 of our DNOs. The line in purple is the Ofgem target and the dotted line is the projected result, with the vertical line showing the maximum reward or penalties. Customer interruptions measures the cumulative amount of interruptions in the customers electricity supply for 100 customers. The chart is used the same basis for reporting an average of all 4 DNOs, however, this chart represents customer interruptions by 100 customers. You will see for the first 6 months under RIIO-ED1 WPD is trending towards exceeding the annual targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. These incentive revenues while earned during the 2015/2016 regulatory year will be received in the 2017/2018 regulatory year. 
Now turning to Slide 12. In addition to the interruption incentive schemes, the second scheme, the broad measure of customer satisfaction measures performance against customer satisfaction. Each month, Ofgem surveys customer satisfaction for services provided by the DNOs. On a scale from 1 to 10, this chart provides results against the targets Ofgem has established for customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a new connection or making a general inquiry. This chart shows WPD's performance through September 2015 for each DNO compared to all other DNOs combined, and demonstrates our excellent customer service. While we have only begin performing under RIIO for 6 months, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of being fast-track afforded us the opportunity to begin to plan our approach to delivering outputs. As we continue to execute on those plans, we're on track to meet or exceed the new targets. We will continue to provide updates to these slides each quarter. And now Vince will walk you through a more detailed outlook at segments earnings."

Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky R",858,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment and the U.K. Regulated segment and lower cost in corporate and other resulting from the corporate restructuring. 
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the third quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and also compared to our 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was slightly favorable for the quarter and flat year-to-date compared to the same periods last year. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the third quarter. 
Let's move to more detailed review of the third quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 15. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earnings for the third quarter were flat compared with a year ago. This result was due to higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investments offset by higher OEM expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions. 
Moving to Slide 16. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.04 increase compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1 of this year, returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher volumes due to incremental weather. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.29 per share in the third quarter of 2015, and $0.01 improvement compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes primarily from lower you us taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year, partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by higher volumes and higher miscellaneous revenues. 
Moving to Slide 18. On the slide, we'll provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16, and '17, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. We continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2016 and '17, the hedge percentages are off the higher expected earnings that Bill discussed. Thus our 2016 hedge ratio came down a little. For 2017, we continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 40% at the end of the second quarter to 66% today at an average rate of $1.60. You can see from the sensitivity table that there was no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in 2016 and '17, if the average hedge rate on open positions is $1.55. These FX sensitivities do not factor in the potential positive effects from restriking existing hedges, which as you know, we've been successfully doing throughout the year. 
Also, on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. As we've discussed previously, under the RIIO model, our revenues for 2015/2016 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate and our 2017, 2018 revenues will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015, 2016. We're now incorporating a forecasted RPI rate of 1.6% in our current planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% that we were previously using. This 1% difference results in a reduction to 2017/2018 allowed revenue and affects our 2017 calendar revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. The lower RPI rate and the revenue giveback are fully reflected in our assumptions that drive the 6% EPS growth through 2017. As a result, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the '15, '16 RPI is now off the current forecast of 1.6%. Looking ahead to November of this year, our 2016/'17 and 2017/'18 tariffs will be based on the forecasted RPI at that time. As you can see on the slide, the current RPI forecasts for '16, '17 is 2.8% and for '17, '18 is 3.1%. Both of which are in line with the rates used in the forecast to hit the 6% earnings growth. 
Before turning the call back to Bill, I wanted to provide an update on our projected U.K. earnings through 2016. As you can see on Slide 19, we've increased our earnings projections for 2015 and '16 from a midpoint in the $1.40 per share range to a midpoint in the $1.43 per share range. The increase for 2015 is primarily driven by the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension. The increase in 2016 is a combination of higher incentive revenues and lower depreciation. We still expect a relatively flat earnings trajectory in the U.K. through 2017. However, it is now off of the higher 2015 year-end forecast of $1.43 per share. That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

There has been a significant increase in request for connections for distributed generation in the U.K., predominantly driven by some very substantial feed-in tariffs that have encouraged a lot of connections. My understanding is the feed-in tariffs are coming to an end or being substantially reduced, such that the demand for this dividend generation has dropped off very significantly. Having said that, there has -- there is a lot of pent-up demand and request on the system and it kind of depends on which DNO you look at.

In terms of its impact on TotEx, developers have to pay the cost of reinforcement upfront, and it's only the bit that possibly benefits us in other ways, but it's actually funded out of the spot. So that 95% of the cost of actually putting in or reinforcing the network in order to connect large photovoltaics is actually met by the developer themselves. So I don't see it as a real big impact on TotEx.

I would say that the RPI forecast has been holding strong in that 3% range. So we're at 2.8% for '16 and 3.1% for '17, so we're feeling pretty good. The exposure there is really only another month, because once that gets set next month, that's really what it will drive for the next 2 years. So we feel comfortable with that exposure. And then, as we continue to layer on the hedges, I think we are extremely comfortable that we can manage the FX exposure and hedge that up to $1.60 through at least '17. So as our comfort level on both of those risk factors improved, we were able to put more of this $0.06 upside kind of into the base forecast. So that $0.06 has been there all along, we are using it as this mitigated up until now."

So that $250 million will drive either dividend growth that Bill talked about or CapEx growth, and then we'll use debt and a little bit of equity.

Also with the recent retirement of Rick Klingensmith, the former President of PPL Global, with us today is Robert Symons, the Chief Executive of our U.K. Utility Western Power Distribution, or WPD. Welcome to the call, Robert.
Moving to Slide 3. You'll see our agenda for today's discussion. We'll begin with an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results. We'll also address our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are reaffirming today. I'll provide an update to our earnings and dividend growth expectations through 2017, both of which we are increasing today. And I'll provide a brief operational overview for our U.S. utilities. Then I'll turn the call over to Robert to review some new disclosures we are making this quarter to provide more transparency on our estimates for incentive revenues at WPD under the new RIIO model. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Before I jump into the earnings details, however, let me tell you briefly where we stand with 3 quarters of the year behind us. Based on the solid year-to-date results, our plans for about $10 billion in infrastructure investments through 2017 and higher expected earnings from our U.K. operations, we're now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. We continue to execute well and we're confident in our growth plans. The company had previously projected 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our business plan is low risk and we are confident in our ability to execute the plan and deliver on our commitments. 
Moving to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2015 reported earnings of $393 million or $0.58 a share, a decrease from $497 million or $0.74 per share a year ago. Year-to-date reported earnings were $283 million or $0.42 per share compared with $1.4 -- $1.04 billion or a $1.57 per share through the same period in 2014. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflect a $915 million loss or $1.36 per share from discontinued operations resulting primarily from the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.51 per share, up 16% from third quarter 2014 adjusted results. 
Through the first 9 months, 2015, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.77 per share, up 15% from a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 5, driven by the strong performance of our fully regulated portfolio, today, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range for earnings from ongoing operations of $2.15 per share to $2.25 per share. If you've tracked us closely through the years, as I know many of you have, you know that we have a strong track record of not just meeting but exceeding earnings targets. And as I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. This increase is driven primarily by higher expected earnings from our regulated operations in the U.K. driven primarily by higher expected incentive revenues and lower depreciation expense resulting from the change in depreciable lives. 
Robert will discuss the details of the higher incentive revenues in his prepared remarks. We now expect the U.K. earnings growth to be 1% to 2% through 2017, previously projected to be flat. And we expect 12% to 14% growth in domestic operations including our corporate services organization. 
Vince will provide an update on our U.K. earnings projections through 2016 in his prepared remarks. Our overall earnings growth is fueled by about $3.5 billion per year of capital investments in our existing infrastructure and service territories, combined with the constructive regulatory jurisdictions where we operate, which results in over 80% of our CapEx earning a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than 6 months. 
Regarding the dividend, we expect minimal dividend growth again for 2016 as we strive to get the payout ratio down into the mid- 60% range, at which time we will target a 4% to 6% dividend growth rate more in line with our earnings growth expectations. We currently expect to be in the targeted payout range by the end of 2016. So our current expectation is that we will grow the dividend more meaningfully starting in 2017, but our current expectation for 2017 is at the low end of the 4% to 6% relative to the dividend. We will expect to maintain at least that level of growth through 2017, but we will assess that when we get there. 
Turning to the operational overview on Slide 6, and beginning with the PPL Electric Utilities rate case, on September 3, we announced the settlement agreement that would provide PPL Electric Utilities an additional $124 million in revenue through a rate increase to be effective January 1, 2016. The settlement will help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. Earlier this month, an administrative law judge from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission recommended the commission approve this settlement. Action by the commission is expected later this year. The settlement is a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity. The agreement highlights the constructive relationships we have in the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work with a variety of parties to secure results that deliver both competitive returns to shareowners and significant benefits to customers. It's the second such settlement we've announced this year. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the Kentucky Public Service Commission's approval of rate increases for our Kentucky utilities following a successful settlement in those proceedings. In both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, we utilized forward test years. This further assists in our ability to reduce regulatory lag. 
Also, in September, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved PPL Electric Utilities request to invest $450 million in new, more advanced meters for its 1.4 million customers. The company plans to replace its existing meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state-mandated regulations on metering technology. Costs will be recovered with little-to-no regulatory lag through a special rider. The replacement is expected to increase rate base by about $330 million.
In Pennsylvania, I'd also like to mention that PPL Electric Utilities received another J.D. Power Award for residential customer satisfaction. The company ranked highest among large Electric Utilities in the Eastern United States. It is the fourth year in a row that the PPL Electric Utilities earned the distinction and the 12th overall in that category. The company has now won 11 J.D. Power Awards for business customer satisfaction as well. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 7, before I move to Kentucky, PPL Electric Utilities took an important step on its proposal to construct a major new transmission line called Project Compass. It's designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast. 
PPL Electric Utilities has filed an interconnection request within the New York Independent System Operator to build a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. The projected capital cost is expected to be $5 million to $600 million. This first section or segment is designed to help make the electric grid more reliable and secure for customers throughout the region and provide substantial savings for New York consumers. If our interconnection request is approved by the New York ISO, additional approvals for this segment will be needed from the Pennsylvania PUC, the New York Public Service Commission, PJM and several other agencies. 
PPL Electric Utilities has extensive experience, as you know, in planning and building regional transmission lines. Just this past spring, we energized the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, which involved the planning, approval and construction of 101 miles of a 500-KV transmission line. 
On the Susquehanna-Roseland project, we demonstrated our ability to cooperate with multiple state and regulatory government agencies and the partner with a neighboring utility, which built an additional 50 miles of transmission line in New Jersey as part of that project. Expenditures for Project Compass are not included in our current capital projections. Our proposal currently calls for this first segment to be built and placed in service by 2023. While the first segment can stand alone as a valuable grid improvement, we continue to evaluate and refine the overall plan for the rest of Project Compass. 
As currently envisioned and based on preliminary estimates, Project Compass, in its entirety, would extend about 475 miles from Western Pennsylvania into Southeastern New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
If you turn to Slide 8, you will see the portion of the transmission line that represents the first segment between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. 
Shifting South to Kentucky. We retired the final 2 generating units at our Green River station on September 30. This marks the completion of our plan to retire 800 megawatts of coal-fired generation in Kentucky. We also continue to analyze the potential impact that the Clean Power Plan could have on our Kentucky operations. The precise impact is difficult to pin down at this point. The final rule has just published last Friday, October 23, and the final impact of the rule will note not be known until the state implementation plan or the state's specific federal implementation plan has been developed. The final rule is already being legally challenged, so this could have an impact as well.  In the end, we will develop a plan for our facilities in collaboration with the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the state energy and environment cabinet. Any investment required to comply with the Clean Power Plan would be incremental to our current CapEx plan. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Robert Symons, CEO of our U.K. operations. He will walk us through our new disclosures on incentive revenues under RIIO-ED1. Robert?"
185508,314625039,887933,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new d",708,"Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. 
Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new disclosures to review our current performance. But before we get into the performance details, I'd like to provide some background on the incentive framework. WPD has a long history of operational excellence. And we expect that to continue into RIIO-ED1. Our ability to execute on our plans and achieve incentive revenue has been key to our financial performance. And once again, WPD is on track to outperform its Ofgem targets in the 2015/2016 regulatory year. And WPD now expects to earn total incentive revenues that exceed prior estimates for '17 and '18. 
Our original plan assume between $80 million and $100 million for 2017 and between $60 million and $90 million for 2018. Based on our performance to date, we're raising guidance estimates for the 2017 calendar year to $90 million to $110 million and $75 million to $105 million for 2018. One of the real benefits of being fast-track through price control review process is that we have more time to ensure we were in a strong position to deliver the output included in the business plans submitted to Ofgem. For example, in advance of the RIIO-ED1 period, we adjusted one of our operational targets to less than 12 hours for supply restoration down from 18 hours to align our performance with the new guaranteed standards in RIIO-ED1. 
The fast-track award of about $43 million per year during RIIO-ED1 period along with our ability to earn incentive revenues are 2 very strong reasons that the U.K. Regulatory model is considered a premium jurisdiction.
Turning to Slide 11. The primary schemes that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost. Both of these schemes are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and the duration of power outages. The targets under RIIO-ED1 are specified in our licenses and become slightly more demanding each year. On this slide, you'll find results for customer minutes lost on the top left of the slide and customer interruptions on the top right. Customer minutes lost measures the cumulative amount of minutes customers are without electricity. In this chart, we are reporting the cumulative average performance of all 4 of our DNOs. The line in purple is the Ofgem target and the dotted line is the projected result, with the vertical line showing the maximum reward or penalties. Customer interruption measures the cumulative amount of interruptions in the customers' electricity supply for 100 customers. The chart is used -- is using the same basis for reporting an average of all 4 DNOs; however, this chart represents customer interruptions by 100 customers. You will see for the first 6 months under RIIO-ED1 WPD is trending towards exceeding the annual targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. These incentive revenues while earned during the 2015/2016 regulatory year will be received in the 2017/2018 regulatory year. 
So now turning to Slide 12. In addition to the interruption incentive schemes, the second scheme, the broad measure of customer satisfaction measures performance against customer satisfaction. Each month, Ofgem surveys customer satisfaction for services provided by the DNOs. On a scale from 1 to 10, this chart provides results against the targets Ofgem has established for customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a new connection or making a general inquiry. This chart shows WPD's performance through September 2015 for each DNO compared to all other DNOs combined and demonstrates our excellent customer service. While we have only been performing under RIIO for 6 months, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of being fast-track afforded us the opportunity to begin to plan our approach to delivering outputs. As we continue to execute on those plans, we're on track to meet or exceed the new targets. We will continue to provide updates to these slides each quarter. And now Vince will walk you through a more detailed look at segments' earnings."
185508,314625039,887933,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky R",863,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment and the U.K. Regulated segment and lower cost in corporate and other resulting from the corporate restructuring. 
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the third quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and also compared to our 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was slightly favorable for the quarter and flat year-to-date compared to the same periods last year. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the third quarter. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the third quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 15. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earnings for the third quarter were flat compared with a year ago. This result was due to higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investments offset by higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions. 
Moving to Slide 16. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.04 increase compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1 of this year, returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher volumes due to normal weather. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.29 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.01 improvement compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes primarily from lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year, partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by higher volumes and higher miscellaneous revenues. 
Moving to Slide 18. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16, and '17, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. We continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2016 and '17, the hedge percentages are off the higher expected U.K. earnings that Bill discussed, thus our 2016 hedge ratio came down a little. 
For 2017, we continue to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 40% at the end of the second quarter to 66% today at an average rate of $1.60. You can see from the sensitivity table that there was no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in 2016 and '17, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is at $1.55. These FX sensitivities do not factor in the potential positive effects from restriking existing hedges, which as you know, we've been successfully doing throughout the year. 
Also, on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. As we've discussed previously, under the RIIO model, our revenues for 2015/2016 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate and our 2017, 2018 revenues will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015, '16 period. We're now incorporating a forecasted RPI rate of 1.6% in our current planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% that we were previously using. This 1% difference results in a reduction to 2017/2018 allowed revenue and affects our 2017 calendar revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. The lower RPI rate and the revenue giveback are fully reflected in our assumptions that drive the 6% EPS growth through 2017. As a result, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the '15, '16 RPI is now off the current forecast of 1.6%. 
Looking ahead to November of this year, our 2016/'17 and 2017/'18 tariffs will be based on the forecasted RPI at that time. As you can see on the slide, the current RPI forecasts for '16, '17 is 2.8% and for '17, '18 is 3.1%. Both of which are in line with the rates used in the forecast to hit the 6% earnings growth.  
Before turning the call back to Bill, I wanted to provide an update on our projected U.K. earnings through 2016. As you can see on Slide 19, we've increased our earnings projections for 2015 and '16 from a midpoint in the $1.40 per share range to a midpoint in the $1.43 per share range. The increase for 2015 is primarily driven by the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension. The increase in 2016 is a combination of higher incentive revenues and lower depreciation. We still expect a relatively flat earnings trajectory in the U.K. through 2017. However, it is now off of the higher 2015 year-end forecast of $1.43 per share. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

There has been a significant increase in request for connections for distributed generation in the U.K., predominantly driven by some very substantial feed-in tariffs that have encouraged a lot of connections. My understanding is those feed-in tariffs are coming to an end or being substantially reduced, such that the demand for distribution generation has dropped off very significantly. Having said that, there has -- there is a lot of pent-up demand and request on the system and it kind of depends on which DNO you look at. I think, of the DNOs that we operate the 4, the 1 where we are seeing the most significant request has really been in the Southwest.

In terms of its impact on TotEx, developers have to pay the cost of reinforcement upfront, and it's only the bit that possibly benefits us in other ways, but it's actually funded out of the TotEx part. So about 95% of the cost of actually putting in or reinforcing the network in order to connect large photovoltaics is actually met by the developer themselves. So I don't see it as a real big impact on TotEx. I think if there was a change in government policy as to how this stuff was funded then that would be the trigger that would trigger a mid-term review if it was the case that companies had to make a larger contribution towards that investment.

In terms of the outcomes that you mentioned on the rate cases, I think they were fair outcomes, not terribly inconsistent with our planning assumptions. I think as we continue to refine our cost structure, as Vince said, both at the corporate level as well as at the utility level, that's going to drive some upside or some improvement there, and that does help the domestic utility growth rate. But I think, it's probably worth mentioning that we're not really changing the domestic utility growth rate from the utilities. What we've really changed and up the overall is the corporate services where we're seeing lower costs. So the lower costs in the corporate services, that $0.02 that Vince mentioned, is really what's moving the domestic utilities growth rates up or everything is combined together to get us to the 6%."

I would say that the RPI forecast has been holding strong in that 3% range. So we're at 2.8% for '16 and 3.1% for '17, so we're feeling pretty good. The exposure there is really only another month, because once that gets set next month, that's really what it will drive for the next 2 years. So we feel comfortable with that exposure. And then, as we continue to layer on the hedges, I think we are extremely comfortable that we can manage the FX exposure and hedge that up to $1.60 through at least '17. So as our comfort level on both of those risk factors improved, we were able to put more of this $0.06 upside kind of into the base forecast.

They're able to basically self fund and still dividend about $400 million of cash a year back to the states. We take that $400 million, add it to our cash from operations, fund our maintenance capital, and we still think we'll have even after we pay the dividend about $250 million and over say the next 3 to 5 years, that will continue to grow as the domestic cash from ops grows. So that $250 million will drive either dividend growth that Bill talked about or CapEx growth, and then we'll use debt and a little bit of equity.

Also with the recent retirement of Rick Klingensmith, the former President of PPL Global, with us today is Robert Symons, the Chief Executive of our U.K. Utility Western Power Distribution, or WPD. Welcome to the call, Robert.
Moving to Slide 3. You'll see our agenda for today's discussion. We'll begin with an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results. We'll also address our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are reaffirming today. I'll provide an update to our earnings and dividend growth expectations through 2017, both of which we are increasing today. And I'll provide a brief operational overview for our U.S. utilities. Then I'll turn the call over to Robert to review some new disclosures we are making this quarter to provide more transparency on our estimates for incentive revenues at WPD under the new RIIO model. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Before I jump into the earnings details, however, let me tell you briefly where we stand with 3 quarters of the year behind us. Based on the solid year-to-date results, our plans for about $10 billion in infrastructure investments through 2017 and higher expected earnings from our U.K. operations, we're now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. We continue to execute well and we're confident in our growth plans. The company had previously projected 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our business plan is low risk and we are confident in our ability to execute the plan and deliver on our commitments. 
Moving to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2015 reported earnings of $393 million or $0.58 a share, a decrease from $497 million or $0.74 per share a year ago. Year-to-date reported earnings were $283 million or $0.42 per share compared with $1.4 -- $1.04 billion or a $1.57 per share through the same period in 2014. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflect a $915 million loss or $1.36 per share from discontinued operations, resulting primarily from the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.51 per share, up 16% from third quarter 2014 adjusted results. 
Through the first 9 months, 2015, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.77 per share, up 15% from a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 5, driven by the strong performance of our fully regulated portfolio, today, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range for earnings from ongoing operations of $2.15 per share to $2.25 per share. If you've tracked us closely through the years, as I know many of you have, you know that we have a strong track record of not just meeting but exceeding earnings targets. And as I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. This increase is driven primarily by higher expected earnings from our regulated operations in the U.K., driven primarily by higher expected incentive revenues and lower depreciation expense resulting from the change in depreciable lives. 
Robert will discuss the details of the higher incentive revenues in his prepared remarks. We now expect the U.K. earnings growth to be 1% to 2% through 2017, previously projected to be flat. And we expect 12% to 14% growth in domestic operations, including our corporate services organization. 
Vince will provide an update on our U.K. earnings projections through 2016 in his prepared remarks. Our overall earnings growth is fueled by about $3.5 billion per year of capital investments in our existing infrastructure and service territories, combined with the constructive regulatory jurisdictions where we operate, which results in over 80% of our CapEx earning a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than 6 months. 
Regarding the dividend, we expect minimal dividend growth again for 2016 as we strive to get the payout ratio down into the mid- 60% range, at which time we will target a 4% to 6% dividend growth rate more in line with our earnings growth expectations. We currently expect to be in the targeted payout range by the end of 2016. So our current expectation is that we will grow the dividend more meaningfully starting in 2017, but our current expectation for 2017 is at the low end of the 4% to 6% relative to the dividend. We will expect to maintain at least that level of growth through 2017, but we will assess that when we get there. 
Turning to the operational overview on Slide 6, and beginning with the PPL Electric Utilities rate case, on September 3, we announced the settlement agreement that would provide PPL Electric Utilities an additional $124 million in revenue through a rate increase to be effective January 1, 2016. The settlement will help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. Earlier this month, an administrative law judge from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission recommended the commission approve this settlement. Action by the commission is expected later this year. The settlement is a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity. The agreement highlights the constructive relationships we have in the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work with a variety of parties to secure results that deliver both competitive returns to shareowners and significant benefits to customers. It's the second such settlement we've announced this year. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the Kentucky Public Service Commission's approval of rate increases for our Kentucky utilities following a successful settlement in those proceedings. In both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, we utilized forward test years. This further assists in our ability to reduce regulatory lag. 
Also, in September, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved PPL Electric Utilities request to invest $450 million in new, more advanced meters for its 1.4 million customers. The company plans to replace its existing meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state-mandated regulations on metering technology. Costs will be recovered with little-to-no regulatory lag through a special rider. The replacement is expected to increase rate base by about $330 million.
In Pennsylvania, I'd also like to mention that PPL Electric Utilities received another J.D. Power Award for residential customer satisfaction. The company ranked highest among large Electric Utilities in the Eastern United States. It is the fourth year in a row that the PPL Electric Utilities earned the distinction and the 12th overall in that category. The company has now won 11 J.D. Power Awards for business customer satisfaction as well. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 7, before I move to Kentucky, PPL Electric Utilities took an important step on its proposal to construct a major new transmission line called Project Compass. It's designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast. 
PPL Electric Utilities has filed an interconnection request within the New York Independent System Operator to build a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. The projected capital cost is expected to be $5 million to $600 million. This first section or segment is designed to help make the electric grid more reliable and secure for customers throughout the region and provide substantial savings for New York consumers. If our interconnection request is approved by the New York ISO, additional approvals for this segment will be needed from the Pennsylvania PUC, the New York Public Service Commission, PJM and several other agencies. 
PPL Electric Utilities has extensive experience, as you know, in planning and building regional transmission lines. Just this past spring, we energized the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, which involved the planning, approval and construction of 101 miles of a 500-KV transmission line. 
On the Susquehanna-Roseland project, we demonstrated our ability to cooperate with multiple state and regulatory government agencies and to partner with a neighboring utility, which built an additional 50 miles of transmission line in New Jersey as part of that project. Expenditures for Project Compass are not included in our current capital projections. Our proposal currently calls for this first segment to be built and placed in service by 2023. While the first segment can stand alone as a valuable grid improvement, we continue to evaluate and refine the overall plan for the rest of Project Compass. 
As currently envisioned and based on preliminary estimates, Project Compass, in its entirety, would extend about 475 miles from Western Pennsylvania into Southeastern New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
If you turn to Slide 8, you will see the portion of the transmission line that represents the first segment between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. 
Shifting South to Kentucky. We retired the final 2 generating units at our Green River station on September 30. This marks the completion of our plan to retire 800 megawatts of coal-fired generation in Kentucky. We also continue to analyze the potential impact that the Clean Power Plan could have on our Kentucky operations. The precise impact is difficult to pin down at this point. The final rule was just published last Friday, October 23, and the final impact of the rule will note not be known until the state implementation plan or the state's specific federal implementation plan has been developed. The final rule is already being legally challenged, so this could have an impact as well. In the end, we will develop a plan for our facilities in collaboration with the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the state energy and environment cabinet. Any investment required to comply with the Clean Power Plan would be incremental to our current CapEx plan. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Robert Symons, CEO of our U.K. operations, who will walk us through our new disclosures on incentive revenues under RIIO-ED1. Robert?"
185508,314625039,887988,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new d",708,"Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. 
Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new disclosures to review our current performance. But before we get into the performance details, I'd like to provide some background on the incentive framework. WPD has a long history of operational excellence. And we expect that to continue into RIIO-ED1. Our ability to execute on our plans and achieve incentive revenue has been key to our financial performance. And once again, WPD is on track to outperform its Ofgem targets in the 2015/2016 regulatory year. And WPD now expects to earn total incentive revenues that exceed prior estimates for '17 and '18. 
Our original plan assumed between $80 million and $100 million for 2017 and between $60 million and $90 million for 2018. Based on our performance to date, we're raising guidance estimates for the 2017 calendar year to $90 million to $110 million and $75 million to $105 million for 2018. One of the real benefits of being fast-track through price control review process is that we've had more time to ensure we were in a strong position to deliver the outputs included in the business plans submitted to Ofgem. For example, in advance of the RIIO-ED1 period, we adjusted one of our operational targets to less than 12 hours for supply restoration, down from 18 hours, to align our performance with the new guaranteed standards in RIIO-ED1. 
The fast-track award of about $43 million per year during RIIO-ED1 period along with our ability to earn incentive revenues are 2 very strong reasons that the U.K. Regulatory model is considered a premium jurisdiction.
Turning to Slide 11. The primary schemes that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost. Both of these schemes are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and the duration of power outages. The targets under RIIO-ED1 are specified in our licenses and become slightly more demanding each year. On this slide, you'll find results for customer minutes lost on the top left of the slide and customer interruptions on the top right. Customer minutes lost measures the cumulative amount of minutes customers are without electricity. In this chart, we are reporting the cumulative average performance of all 4 of our DNOs. The line in purple is the Ofgem target and the dotted line is the projected result, with the vertical line showing the maximum rewards or penalties. Customer interruption measures the cumulative amount of interruptions in the customers' electricity supply for 100 customers. The chart is used -- is using the same basis for reporting an average of all 4 DNOs; however, this chart represents customer interruptions by 100 customers. You will see for the first 6 months under RIIO-ED1 WPD is trending towards exceeding the annual targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. These incentive revenues while earned during the 2015/2016 regulatory year will be received in the 2017/2018 regulatory year. 
So now turning to Slide 12. In addition to the interruption incentive schemes, the second scheme, the broad measure of customer satisfaction, measures performance against customer satisfaction. Each month, Ofgem surveys customer satisfaction for services provided by the DNOs. On a scale from 1 to 10, this chart provides results against the targets Ofgem has established for customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a new connection or making a general inquiry. This chart shows WPD's performance through September 2015 for each DNO compared to all other DNOs combined and demonstrates our excellent customer service. While we have only been performing under RIIO for 6 months, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of being fast-track afforded us the opportunity to begin to plan our approach to delivering outputs. As we continue to execute on those plans, we're on track to meet or exceed the new targets. We will continue to provide updates to these slides each quarter. And now Vince will walk you through a more detailed look at segments' earnings."
185508,314625039,887988,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky R",863,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment and the U.K. Regulated segment and lower cost in corporate and other resulting from the corporate restructuring. 
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the third quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and also compared to our 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was slightly favorable for the quarter and flat year-to-date compared to the same periods last year. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the third quarter. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the third quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 15. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earnings for the third quarter were flat compared with a year ago. This result was due to higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investments offset by higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions. 
Moving to Slide 16. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.04 increase compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1 of this year, returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher volumes due to normal weather. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.29 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.01 improvement compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes, primarily from lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year, partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by higher volumes and higher miscellaneous revenues. 
Moving to Slide 18. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16, and '17, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. We continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2016 and '17, the hedge percentages are off the higher expected U.K. earnings that Bill discussed, thus our 2016 hedge ratio came down a little. 
For 2017, we continue to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 40% at the end of the second quarter to 66% today at an average rate of $1.60. You can see from the sensitivity table that there was no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in 2016 and '17, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is $1.55. These FX sensitivities do not factor in the potential positive effects from restriking existing hedges, which as you know, we've been successfully doing throughout the year. 
Also, on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. As we've discussed previously, under the RIIO model, our revenues for 2015/2016 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate and our 2017, 2018 revenues will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015, '16 period. We're now incorporating a forecasted RPI rate of 1.6% in our current planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% that we were previously using. This 1% difference results in a reduction to 2017/2018 allowed revenue and affects our 2017 calendar revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. The lower RPI rate and the revenue giveback are fully reflected in our assumptions that drive the 6% EPS growth through 2017. As a result, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the '15, '16 RPI is now off the current forecast of 1.6%. 
Looking ahead to November of this year, our 2016/'17 and 2017/'18 tariffs will be based on the forecasted RPI at that time. As you can see on the slide, the current RPI forecasts for '16, '17 is 2.8% and for '17, '18 is 3.1%, both of which are in line with the rates used in the forecast to hit the 6% earnings growth.  
Before turning the call back to Bill, I wanted to provide an update on our projected U.K. earnings through 2016. As you can see on Slide 19, we have increased our earnings projections for 2015 and '16 from a midpoint in the $1.40 per share range to a midpoint in the $1.43 per share range. The increase for 2015 is primarily driven by the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension. The increase in 2016 is a combination of higher incentive revenues and lower depreciation. We still expect a relatively flat earnings trajectory in the U.K. through 2017. However, it is now off of the higher 2015 year-end forecast of $1.43 per share. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

In terms of its impact on TotEx, developers have to pay the cost of reinforcement upfront, and it's only the bit that possibly benefits us in other ways, but it's actually funded out of the TotEx pot. So about 95% of the cost of actually putting in or reinforcing the network in order to connect large photovoltaics is actually met by the developer themselves. So I don't see it as a real big impact on TotEx. I think if there was a change in government policy as to how this stuff was funded then that would be the trigger that would trigger a mid-term review if it was the case that companies had to make a larger contribution towards that investment.

The exposure there is really only another month, because once that gets set next month, that's really what it will drive for the next 2 years. So we feel comfortable with that exposure. And then, as we continue to layer on the hedges, I think we are extremely comfortable that we can manage the FX exposure and hedge that up to $1.60 through at least '17.

We take that $400 million, add it to our cash from operations, fund our maintenance capital, and we still think we'll have even after we pay the dividend, about $250 million. And over say the next 3 to 5 years, that will continue to grow as the domestic cash from ops grows. So that $250 million will drive either dividend growth that Bill talked about or CapEx growth, and then we'll use debt and a little bit of equity.

So if '16, '17 comes in on an actual basis, less than the 2.8%, that would be given back in '18, '19. But also, if it comes in higher, we will receive additional revenues in '18, '19. So it's not one way."

Welcome to the call, Robert.
Moving to Slide 3. You'll see our agenda for today's discussion. We'll begin with an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results. We'll also address our 2015 earnings forecast, which we are reaffirming today. I'll provide an update to our earnings and dividend growth expectations through 2017, both of which we are increasing today. And I'll provide a brief operational overview for our U.S. utilities. Then I'll turn the call over to Robert to review some new disclosures we are making this quarter to provide more transparency on our estimates for incentive revenues at WPD under the new RIIO model. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Before I jump into the earnings details, however, let me tell you briefly where we stand with 3 quarters of the year behind us. Based on the solid year-to-date results, our plans for about $10 billion in infrastructure investments through 2017 and higher expected earnings from our U.K. operations, we're now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. We continue to execute well and we're confident in our growth plans. The company had previously projected 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our business plan is low risk and we are confident in our ability to execute the plan and deliver on our commitments. 
Moving to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2015 reported earnings of $393 million or $0.58 a share, a decrease from $497 million or $0.74 per share a year ago. Year-to-date reported earnings were $283 million or $0.42 per share compared with $1.4 -- $1.04 billion or a $1.57 per share through the same period in 2014. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflect a $915 million loss or $1.36 per share from discontinued operations, resulting primarily from the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.51 per share, up 16% from third quarter 2014 adjusted results. 
Through the first 9 months, 2015, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.77 per share, up 15% from a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 5, driven by the strong performance of our fully regulated portfolio, today, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range for earnings from ongoing operations of $2.15 per share to $2.25 per share. If you've tracked us closely through the years, as I know many of you have, you know that we have a strong track record of not just meeting but exceeding earnings targets. And as I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. This increase is driven primarily by higher expected earnings from our regulated operations in the U.K., driven primarily by higher expected incentive revenues and lower depreciation expense resulting from the change in depreciable lives. 
Robert will discuss the details of the higher incentive revenues in his prepared remarks. We now expect the U.K. earnings growth to be 1% to 2% through 2017, previously projected to be flat. And we expect 12% to 14% growth in domestic operations, including our corporate services organization. 
Vince will provide an update on our U.K. earnings projections through 2016 in his prepared remarks. Our overall earnings growth is fueled by about $3.5 billion per year of capital investments in our existing infrastructure and service territories, combined with the constructive regulatory jurisdictions where we operate, which results in over 80% of our CapEx earning a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than 6 months. 
Regarding the dividend, we expect minimal dividend growth again for 2016 as we strive to get the payout ratio down into the mid- 60% range, at which time we will target a 4% to 6% dividend growth rate more in line with our earnings growth expectations. We currently expect to be in the targeted payout range by the end of 2016. So our current expectation is that we will grow the dividend more meaningfully starting in 2017, but our current expectation for 2017 is at the low end of the 4% to 6% relative to the dividend. We will expect to maintain at least that level of growth through 2017, but we will assess that when we get there. 
Turning to the operational overview on Slide 6, and beginning with the PPL Electric Utilities rate case, on September 3, we announced the settlement agreement that would provide PPL Electric Utilities an additional $124 million in revenue through a rate increase to be effective January 1, 2016. The settlement will help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. Earlier this month, an administrative law judge from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission recommended the commission approve this settlement. Action by the commission is expected later this year. The settlement is a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity. The agreement highlights the constructive relationships we have in the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work with a variety of parties to secure results that deliver both competitive returns to shareowners and significant benefits to customers. It's the second such settlement we've announced this year. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the Kentucky Public Service Commission's approval of rate increases for our Kentucky utilities following a successful settlement in those proceedings. In both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, we utilized forward test years. This further assists in our ability to reduce regulatory lag. 
Also, in September, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved PPL Electric Utilities request to invest $450 million in new, more advanced meters for its 1.4 million customers. The company plans to replace its existing meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state-mandated regulations on metering technology. Costs will be recovered with little-to-no regulatory lag through a special rider. The replacement is expected to increase rate base by about $330 million.
In Pennsylvania, I'd also like to mention that PPL Electric Utilities received another J.D. Power Award for residential customer satisfaction. The company ranked highest among large Electric Utilities in the Eastern United States. It is the fourth year in a row that the PPL Electric Utilities earned the distinction and the 12th overall in that category. The company has now won 11 J.D. Power Awards for business customer satisfaction as well. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 7, before I move to Kentucky, PPL Electric Utilities took an important step on its proposal to construct a major new transmission line called Project Compass. It's designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast. 
PPL Electric Utilities has filed an interconnection request within the New York Independent System Operator to build a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. The projected capital cost is expected to be $5 million to $600 million. This first section or segment is designed to help make the electric grid more reliable and secure for customers throughout the region and provide substantial savings for New York consumers. If our interconnection request is approved by the New York ISO, additional approvals for this segment will be needed from the Pennsylvania PUC, the New York Public Service Commission, PJM and several other agencies. 
PPL Electric Utilities has extensive experience, as you know, in planning and building regional transmission lines. Just this past spring, we energized the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, which involved the planning, approval and construction of 101 miles of a 500-KV transmission line. 
On the Susquehanna-Roseland project, we demonstrated our ability to cooperate with multiple state and regulatory government agencies and to partner with a neighboring utility, which built an additional 50 miles of transmission line in New Jersey as part of that project. Expenditures for Project Compass are not included in our current capital projections. Our proposal currently calls for this first segment to be built and placed in service by 2023. While the first segment can stand alone as a valuable grid improvement, we continue to evaluate and refine the overall plan for the rest of Project Compass. 
As currently envisioned and based on preliminary estimates, Project Compass, in its entirety, would extend about 475 miles from Western Pennsylvania into Southeastern New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
If you turn to Slide 8, you will see the portion of the transmission line that represents the first segment between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. 
Shifting South to Kentucky. We retired the final 2 generating units at our Green River station on September 30. This marks the completion of our plan to retire 800 megawatts of coal-fired generation in Kentucky. We also continue to analyze the potential impact that the Clean Power Plan could have on our Kentucky operations. The precise impact is difficult to pin down at this point. The final rule was just published last Friday, October 23, and the final impact of the rule will note not be known until the state implementation plan or the state's specific federal implementation plan has been developed. The final rule is already being legally challenged, so this could have an impact as well. In the end, we will develop a plan for our facilities in collaboration with the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the state energy and environment cabinet. Any investment required to comply with the Clean Power Plan would be incremental to our current CapEx plan. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Robert Symons, CEO of our U.K. operations, who will walk us through our new disclosures on incentive revenues under RIIO-ED1. Robert?"
185508,314625039,888544,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new d",708,"Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. 
Moving to Slide 10. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new disclosures to review our current performance. But before we get into the performance details, I'd like to provide some background on the incentive framework. WPD has a long history of operational excellence. And we expect that to continue into RIIO-ED1. Our ability to execute on our plans and achieve incentive revenue has been key to our financial performance. And once again, WPD is on track to outperform its Ofgem targets in the 2015/2016 regulatory year. And WPD now expects to earn total incentive revenues that exceed prior estimates for '17 and '18. 
Our original plan assumed between $80 million and $100 million for 2017 and between $60 million and $90 million for 2018. Based on our performance to date, we're raising guidance estimates for the 2017 calendar year to $90 million to $110 million and $75 million to $105 million for 2018. One of the real benefits of being fast-track through price control review process is that we've had more time to ensure we were in a strong position to deliver the outputs included in the business plans submitted to Ofgem. For example, in advance of the RIIO-ED1 period, we adjusted one of our operational targets to less than 12 hours for supply restoration, down from 18 hours, to align our performance with the new guaranteed standards in RIIO-ED1. 
The fast-track award of about $43 million per year during RIIO-ED1 period along with our ability to earn incentive revenues are 2 very strong reasons that the U.K. Regulatory model is considered a premium jurisdiction.
Turning to Slide 11. The primary schemes that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost. Both of these schemes are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and the duration of power outages. The targets under RIIO-ED1 are specified in our licenses and become slightly more demanding each year. On this slide, you'll find results for customer minutes lost on the top left of the slide and customer interruptions on the top right. Customer minutes lost measures the cumulative amount of minutes customers are without electricity. In this chart, we are reporting the cumulative average performance of all 4 of our DNOs. The line in purple is the Ofgem target and the dotted line is the projected result, with the vertical line showing the maximum rewards or penalties. Customer interruption measures the cumulative amount of interruptions in the customers' electricity supply for 100 customers. The chart is used -- is using the same basis for reporting an average of all 4 DNOs; however, this chart represents customer interruptions by 100 customers. You will see for the first 6 months under RIIO-ED1 WPD is trending towards exceeding the annual targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. These incentive revenues while earned during the 2015/2016 regulatory year will be received in the 2017/2018 regulatory year. 
So now turning to Slide 12. In addition to the interruption incentive schemes, the second scheme, the broad measure of customer satisfaction, measures performance against customer satisfaction. Each month, Ofgem surveys customer satisfaction for services provided by the DNOs. On a scale from 1 to 10, this chart provides results against the targets Ofgem has established for customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a new connection or making a general inquiry. This chart shows WPD's performance through September 2015 for each DNO compared to all other DNOs combined and demonstrates our excellent customer service. While we have only been performing under RIIO for 6 months, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of being fast-track afforded us the opportunity to begin to plan our approach to delivering outputs. As we continue to execute on those plans, we're on track to meet or exceed the new targets. We will continue to provide updates to these slides each quarter. And now Vince will walk you through a more detailed look at segments' earnings."
185508,314625039,888544,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky R",863,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment and the U.K. Regulated segment and lower cost in corporate and other resulting from the corporate restructuring. 
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the third quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and also compared to our 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was slightly favorable for the quarter and flat year-to-date compared to the same periods last year. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the third quarter. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the third quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 15. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earnings for the third quarter were flat compared with a year ago. This result was due to higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investments offset by higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions. 
Moving to Slide 16. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.04 increase compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1 of this year, returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher volumes due to normal weather. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.29 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.01 improvement compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes, primarily from lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year, partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by higher volumes and higher miscellaneous revenues. 
Moving to Slide 18. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, '16, and '17, including sensitivities for $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. We continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2016 and '17, the hedge percentages are off the higher expected U.K. earnings that Bill discussed, thus our 2016 hedge ratio came down a little. 
For 2017, we continue to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 40% at the end of the second quarter to 66% today at an average rate of $1.60. You can see from the sensitivity table that there was no exposure for the remainder of '15, minimal exposure in 2016 and '17, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is $1.55. These FX sensitivities do not factor in the potential positive effects from restriking existing hedges, which as you know, we've been successfully doing throughout the year. 
Also, on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. As we've discussed previously, under the RIIO model, our revenues for 2015/2016 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate and our 2017, 2018 revenues will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015, '16 period. We're now incorporating a forecasted RPI rate of 1.6% in our current planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% that we were previously using. This 1% difference results in a reduction to 2017/2018 allowed revenue and affects our 2017 calendar revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. The lower RPI rate and the revenue giveback are fully reflected in our assumptions that drive the 6% EPS growth through 2017. As a result, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the '15, '16 RPI is now off the current forecast of 1.6%. 
Looking ahead to November of this year, our 2016/'17 and 2017/'18 tariffs will be based on the forecasted RPI at that time. As you can see on the slide, the current RPI forecasts for '16, '17 is 2.8% and for '17, '18 is 3.1%, both of which are in line with the rates used in the forecast to hit the 6% earnings growth.  
Before turning the call back to Bill, I wanted to provide an update on our projected U.K. earnings through 2016. As you can see on Slide 19, we have increased our earnings projections for 2015 and '16 from a midpoint in the $1.40 per share range to a midpoint in the $1.43 per share range. The increase for 2015 is primarily driven by the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension. The increase in 2016 is a combination of higher incentive revenues and lower depreciation. We still expect a relatively flat earnings trajectory in the U.K. through 2017. However, it is now off of the higher 2015 year-end forecast of $1.43 per share. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

There has been a significant increase in requests for connections for distributed generation in the U.K., predominantly driven by some very substantial feed-in tariffs that have encouraged a lot of connections. My understanding is those feed-in tariffs are coming to an end or being substantially reduced, such that the demand for distributed generation has dropped off very significantly. Having said that, there has -- there is a lot of pent-up demand and request on the system and it kind of depends on which DNO you look at.

In terms of its impact on TotEx, developers have to pay the cost of reinforcement upfront, and it's only the bit that possibly benefits us in other ways, but it's actually funded out of the TotEx pot. So about 95% of the cost of actually putting in or reinforcing the network in order to connect large photovoltaics is actually met by the developer themselves. So I don't see it as a real big impact on TotEx. I think if there was a change in government policy as to how this stuff was funded then that would be the trigger that would trigger a mid-term review if it was the case that companies had to make a larger contribution towards that investment.

So Steven, I would say, the 6% as we were going through the planning -- for the $0.06, as we're going through the planning process, we didn't bake up until now, all of that $0.06 of depreciation upside through 2017 because of the risks around RPI and",193,"Yes. So Steven, I would say, the 6% as we were going through the planning -- for the $0.06, as we're going through the planning process, we didn't bake up until now, all of that $0.06 of depreciation upside through 2017 because of the risks around RPI and FX. I would say that the RPI forecast has been holding strong in that 3% range. So we're at 2.8% for '16 and 3.1% for '17, so we're feeling pretty good. The exposure there is really only another month, because once that gets set next month, that's really what it will drive for the next 2 years. So we feel comfortable with that exposure. And then, as we continue to layer on the hedges, I think we are extremely comfortable that we can manage the FX exposure and hedge that up to $1.60 through at least '17. So as our comfort level on both of those risk factors improved, we were able to put more of this $0.06 upside kind of into the base forecast. So that $0.06 has been there all along, but we are using it as a risk mitigant up until now."

It's the same slide that we went through last quarter in terms of funding the growth. So in the U.K., I'll just reiterate that the U.K. business is fully self-funding variable with their cash from operations and their ability to borrow in country and maintain their 80% to 85% debt to rev ratios. They're able to basically self-fund and still dividend about $400 million of cash a year back to the states. We take that $400 million, add it to our cash from operations, fund our maintenance capital, and we still think we'll have even after we pay the dividend, about $250 million. And over say the next 3 to 5 years, that will continue to grow as the domestic cash from ops grows. So that $250 million will drive either dividend growth that Bill talked about or CapEx growth, and then we'll use debt and a little bit of equity. We still have the $200 million of maxed equity issuances in the plan. Everything else would be funded with debt, and we're able to do that and maintain our solid investment-grade credit ratings."
