This morning, we announced that the company earned $1.39 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. Excluding transaction and asset impairment charges, earnings were a record $1.69 per fully diluted share, an increase of 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. EBITDA on this basis improved 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. For the full year 2014, GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $5.82. Excluding other items and impairment charges, earnings were a record $6.07 per fully diluted share, up 12% from the prior year. EBITDA for the year, excluding other items and impairment charges, was a record $4.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year on the same basis. 
Looking forward, we obviously faced some significant challenges in the markets that we serve, and we will be discussing these through the next hour. But first, I want to take a moment and reflect on the company's accomplishments in 2014 and say thanks to the world's best oilfield services team. NOV completed the spin out of our Distribution Services business to our shareholders as NOW Inc. in May which led us to reorganize our remaining business along 4 new reporting segments and promote several executives into new leadership positions. Our new segment architecture is around customer axis switch opened up new strategic possibilities for us. So our leadership teams spent the summer developing long-term strategies for each business. We presented this in our first Investor Day in November where we also laid out ambitious 5-year goals. 2014 also saw us announce a large increase in our dividend, lifting our payout ratio to within the range of 30%, as well as the authorization of a $3 billion stock buyback. Given the pace of change here through 2014, it would have been easy to have been distracted. I think the pace of change here makes NOV's 2014 record results doubly impressive. We had several business units post record annual and record quarterly results in 2014. I would like to express my gratitude to every one of our 60,000 employees who continue to execute exceptionally well on behalf of our customers, despite all these changes, to deliver great financial results for our shareholders. Thank you. 
As we look forward though, we face a tough market. With oil prices down more than 50%, our customers are quickly cutting spending and a downturn we face will be severe in 2015 and possibly beyond. Drilling activity is falling sharply and our visibility is limited. The industry finds itself in this downturn, we believe, because rapidly growing North American oil supply, coupled with slowing demand in the OECD, slowing demand growth in China and other emerging economies and a strong U.S. dollar all contributed to a supply-demand imbalance for oil late last year. With regards to slow oil demand in Europe and emerging economies, significantly lower energy costs were a meaningful widespread economic stimulus. As economies in Europe and Asia eventually strengthen, low oil prices and rising economic activity will spur oil demand growth for these regions. Second, we do not believe that global excess production capacity is excessive by historical standards. We do not face the kind of structural global overhang the industry faced in 1986 when Saudi Arabian production had been curtailed down to about 4 million barrels of oil per day and spare global oil capacity exceeded 15% of demand. We believe that this downturn will be more like 2002 or 2009. In both prior instances, recovery came within about 2 years. Third, we believe the recent swing source of incremental global oil supply is coming from North American shales. The production type curve from these basins exhibit extraordinarily steep decline rates, which is well-documented across thousands of wells in multiple shale basins. New shale reservoirs exhibit perhaps the highest national decline rates from any major source of oil in the industry's modern history. We see North America slowing dramatically and quickly, in the rate of new shale wells coming online will decline and the 4 million barrels of oil per day from U.S. shales will then begin to decline and will decline steeply. We believe this could lead to modest oil price recovery as late 2015. However, we expect shale production to continue to grow through the first half of 2015 before it begins to fall as remaining inventory of well bores is completed and brought online, which means a recovery once it arrives, may be a slower grind higher despite the steep decline from behavior of shale oil. 
So in summary, a significant oil demand component to the imbalance driven by macroeconomic conditions, lower oil costs contributing to eventual economic recovery, a major source of supply from extraordinarily high decline curve reservoirs and a sharp drilling reduction response from the oil industry are pretty good set of ingredients with which to bake an oil prize recovery scenario. Nevertheless, we acknowledge many factors to keep oil prices down for longer. Deteriorating global economic conditions, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar or the returns market of oil from certain sideline inventories come to mind. However, given the speed at which we see drilling activity slowing, it is very difficult for us to imagine that we will not see a significant oil supply response relatively soon. We don't believe the world can sustainably grow its oil supply with prices below say 80 -- $75 a barrel and with prices below $60, oil production will begin to contract. Since oil supply growth will eventually be required at some point in the future, it stands to reason oil prices must eventually cycle back up above $75 over the long-run. 
Given our short term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach to 2015 will be to focus on what we can control. We plan to manage NOV to the market quarter-to-quarter in view of near-term orders and activity while we steadily reduce costs as utilization levels permit, while also continuing to advance the long-term strategic goals we outlined at Investor Day. We will manage to the realities of the markets we serve, but we plan to emerge from this cyclical downturn a better company, achieving new higher levels of operational excellence. The record fourth quarter results that we just announced reflect very little of the impending downturn. In fact, many of our operations spent the fourth quarter working 3 shifts 24/7 to meet our delivery obligations. Through 2014 we shipped record levels of top drives, preventers Fiberglass Pipe, jacking systems and numerous other products. In January, we did begin to see a drop in activity affecting our operations in a more widespread way, most acutely in Wellbore Technologies, but really all segments seen some impact. In view of the challenges ahead we are beginning to bring work in from our suppliers to keep our facilities better loaded. So for instance right now, 52% of our machining requirements within rig systems and aftermarket are outsourced. As work declines we will be repositioning some of that work into our own facilities.  We're examining opportunities to consolidate facilities where possible, and we are working with our suppliers to improve efficiencies and costs as our customers press us for cost savings for their supply chains. 
I have tremendous confidence in the NOV's teams ability to manage through the downturn and reduce costs. Although we have new leadership and new positions throughout our new organization, I will stress that these figures are not new to NOV, nor are they new to the industry or to cyclical downturns. By my count this would be the sixth cyclical downturn we have faced through our careers. Unfortunately, despite our cost reduction measures we will nevertheless expect to see steep decrementals through 2015 as pricing pressure and low absorption on lower volumes will pressure margins. 
Orders for all our products has slowed sharply, offshore, land, drilling, completion and production. Customers are delaying purchases of both capital and consumables wherever possible seeking to conserve cash in the face of market uncertainty. We soon expect to see our customers begin to cannibalize existing equipment for capital components. For instance, pull a top drive off an idled rig within their fleet rather than place a new order for a new one with NOV in order to keep another contracted rate in need of a top drive working. Our customers will raid the spares inventory from their idled rigs to support those that are contracted and contributing -- and continuing to work, rather than place a spares order with us. They will redirect drill pipe, bits, jars, shakers and other kits rather than place new orders with us. History teaches us to expect this behavior to continue for at least the next couple of quarters meaning orders will continue to be slow and our book-to-bill and Rig Systems well below one. 
However, this behavior is not sustainable over the long-term. Drilling consumes rigs much like driving consumes for automobile. The rate of consumption for capital equipment and consumables is declining with drilling activity, but customer spending always seems to overact through cyclical downturns by living off their inventory and postponing maintenance and upgrades wherever they can. That only works for so long. Maintenance and upgrades can be deferred but cannot be postponed indefinitely for drilling rigs, so demand will return. In the past, this behavior has fueled demand surges for the kit NOV provides. Our markets change quickly in both directions. 
Also, we see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their rigs to meet contractual requirements or simply differentiate their rigs in the race to offer the most efficient drilling rigs. There remains interest, if only academic for the time being, in what the next big thing is for drilling, configurable drill floors, closed loop automated drilling systems, automated pipe tailing and stand transfer of vehicles for land rigs, retrievable subsea BOP pods, low-cost mid-water floater designs, concepts which NOV continues to advance in accordance with our 10-year [ph] goals. Offshore, we are seeing customer defer some of their SPS survey work, although our total volume of SPS work continues to rise. As we've described in the past, offshore rigs are required to undergo shipyard surveys and obtain OEM certificates of compliance and activity called a special periodic survey or SPS to maintain their class designations and be qualified to drill in most markets.  In an $80 oil world, contractors will proceed with the SPS on an uncontracted rig to ensure it is qualified for any potential contract which may arise which would require a pressing spud day. In a $50 oil world, contractors are incrementally less willing to invest in the SPS for an uncontracted rig and would be more willing to forgo the possibility of missing a quick spud day contract. As a side note, when the recovery comes to the offshore drilling market, shipyard capacity to execute SPSs may become a very scarce resource. In a $50 oil world, contractors become much more circumspect about all investments in older rigs. We expect to see even more rig retirements, both land and offshore, both announced and unannounced, in addition to those that we've seen already. This phenomenon has been witnessed in every category of drilling rigs passing through periodic cyclical downturns and incrementally contributes to better supply demand balance for the fleets. Rig Systems posted new orders of $470 million, or a book-to-bill of just 21%, reflecting the customer mindset I just discussed. This resulted in a Rig Systems backlog of $12.5 billion to start 2015. This is a high backlog for NOV by historical standards, 16% higher than we carried into the 2009 downturn for instance. We expect it to partly but not fully mitigate the effect of lower orders through 2015 on our day-to-day operations in rig systems. We foresee revenue out of backlog to remaining strong through the first quarter of 2015 north of $2 billion, but beginning to decline modestly in the second quarter, more steeply in the third, fourth quarters of 2015. While 2015 orders will be slow, we do continue to see modest demand for certain markets like 20,000-psi deepwater, Middle Eastern land markets, Mexico and Argentina. 
Orders for Completion & Production Solutions did better through the fourth quarter, posting a book-to-bill of 60% on $469 million in orders, which resulted in a backlog of $1.8 billion to start 2015. On the production side, we continue to advanced discussions around some large FPSO projects despite of the low oil prices. In fact, the downturn and the troubled offshore project execution performance by the majors and NOCs has opened the door to new ideas amongst our large customers. There's growing interest around doing things differently in deepwater developments to drive lower costs. We're accepting lots of invitations from majors to discuss our modular approach to vessel construction, to bring modern supply chain management techniques to bear to produce better results. Necessity is the mother of invention, and this market is wide open to new approaches. Our new approach is to offer a timely integrated package of NOV kit to minimize the interface conflicts brought about by the fragmented supply chain approach currently used to build these vessels. We seek to recycle designs and avoid reinventing the wheel for each new vessel which inevitably leads to unplanned manufacturing costs and delays. 
NOV has a tremendous track record of success, and bringing this modular package approach to the construction of offshore drilling rigs through the last decade. Our extensive experience in working closely with shipyards to execute, install and commission these complex construction projects uniquely positions NOV to help the industry pioneer a better way. Although a large integrated package FPSO order for NOV is still a ways away, we've made great progress in securing customer buying through our new approach on 2 specific FPSO projects which we ultimately expect to turn into firm orders perhaps as early as late 2015. 
For both the Rig Systems and Completion & Production Solutions  segments, we are glad to be able to carry strong backlogs into this downturn. Except for minor exceptions, the firm contracts governing our backlog projects do not permit cancellation for convenience. In 2009, we saw about 4% of our backlog evaporate not really from cancellations, but rather from customer payment defaults. We expect a vast majority of our current backlog to be executed in accordance with the agreed terms like we experienced 6 years ago. In certain instances, we are considering customer requests for delivery delays, which can help us better manage costs in our currently stretched supply chain. But generally we expect continued on-time execution of our backlog to continue. Our 2009 stress test provides good empirical evidence for this outlook. 
Our 22 Brazil Atlas project floating rigs constitute about $3.5 billion of our backlog. We are ahead on progress payments on each of these projects, meaning we have collected more than we have invested and the inventory delivered on these as planned as we continue to fabricate components. We will begin installation and commissioning operations soon and are commencing riser manufacturing in Brazil currently. Generally, progress has been steady, but a little slower than originally planned which has not surprised us. While we have had some payment delays with some of our Brazilian shipyard customers who are building out their new shipyard facilities, we are confident in the successful completion of these rigs due to the financing package provided to the shipyards customers by the Brazilian Development Bank and the construction of banks a few weeks ago to fund the next 18 months of construction. Additionally, the shipyards have Asian partners who are, in some instances, providing additional capital to complete the construction of their facilities. The country of Brazil is all in on this and the rigs will be completed successfully. 
Like I said earlier, NOV will emerge from this downturn a stronger and better company. We are continuing to advance new technologies like closed loop automated training, which has significantly improve drilling performance through several pilot programs. Other innovations like our water oil recovery system for produced waters, thermal cuttings absorption technologies, Tundicycle is automated by pending Coudersport land rig and retrievable cause for some CBO piece will continue to make the oil more safer and productive. We have a strong balance sheet to help weather this downturn. We are seeking to invest opportunistically through this downturn. We continue to pursue our singles and doubles acquisition strategy, which improves our capabilities and global reach in our technology portfolio. We have 7 letters of intent in place and probably triple that in potential prospects. We also began investing in a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. Today, we have repurchased over 11.6 million shares of NOV for $779 million, which is a 2.7% reduction in our share count. Thus far, we have been able to accomplish this using cash on our balance sheet, which we have been able to repatriate from overseas locations. The $2.2 billion remaining on our current authorization we plan to continue to repurchase NOV shares through the downturn, including, if necessary, using modest levels of debt from time to time to bridge to the next opportunity to repatriate cash from overseas. 
Importantly, we acknowledged at our recent Investor Day that this is a cyclical business, and once or twice every decade, oil, as a commodity, tests its microeconomic variable cash cost floor of the marginal barrel. And setting our long-term strategies, we intentionally look through the cyclical downturn to entrepreneurially focus on actionable opportunities that we see ahead. My sixth cyclical downturn has not dissuaded me from the basic pieces we outlined in November in line with ExxonMobil's outlook 2040 study. At the world's population will grow from $7 billion to $9 billion by the year 2040, economic growth will continue, standards of living will rise, oil and gas production will grow from a combination of shales and deepwater to fuel the world's appetite for energy and a better life. Specifically, the Exxon study calls for 25% growth in oil and 65% growth in gas through the next 25 years. In the near term, the MP industry will sharpen its focus on improving economic efficiencies and marginal cost of production of oil from all sources of oil as it has always done. And as the leading provider of innovation and technology and industrial capability to this critical entrepreneurial industry, National Oilwell Varco will play a key role in making that happen, and emerge better-positioned for the inevitable upturn. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy to take you through our fourth quarter and outlook. Jeremy?"

Since Clay already covered the consolidated results of this dive straight our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and fifth -- fiscal year December 31, 2014 and then attempt to provide each a color outlook for 2015. The Rig",2894,"Thanks, Clay. Since Clay already covered the consolidated results of this dive straight our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and fifth -- fiscal year December 31, 2014 and then attempt to provide each a color outlook for 2015. The Rig Systems segment generated quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% from a record third quarter as revenue out of backlog on offshore projects was not quite as strong sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 7% due to heightened demand for high spec land rigs and equipment and our recent capacity additions which have enabled us to convert more revenue out of backlog over the prior year. Operating profit for the segment was $511 million and operating margins were 20% which were flat with the previous quarter despite the 4% sequential decline in revenue, and up 90 basis points from the prior year.  Fourth quarter EBITDA for this segment was $534 million or 20.9% of sales. For the full year 2014, Rig Systems closed a record revenues of $9.8 billion, up 16.5% over 2013 and produced operating profit of almost $2 billion or 20.3% of sales, which resulted in year-over-year flow through or leverage of 27%. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the fourth quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized $2.3 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured $470 million in new orders resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $12.5 billion. In the quarter, we secured 3 [ph] each drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, 5-inch [ph] land rigs and a smattering of offshore and land components. Of the total $12.5 billion in quarter-ending backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 91% is destined for international markets. 
The Rig Aftermarket segment posted record revenues of $850 million in the fourth quarter 2014, up 2% sequentially and up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013. As our large and growing installed base of equipment, combined with the investments that we have made in additional personnel, training, global infrastructure and inventory, have resulted in solid growth, operating profit for the segment was $245 million or 28.8% of revenue. That's up 140 basis points sequentially and up 300 basis points from the prior year on more favorable mix, with a higher percentage of high-margin service work and an unseasonably lower percentage of lower margin repair work. For the quarter, EBITDA for this segment was $252 million or 29.6% of revenue.  For the full year 2014, Rig Aftermarket posted record revenues of $3.2 billion or 19.7% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $882 million or 27.4% of sales, which represented 29% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment posted record revenues of $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 11.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In the quarter, several businesses, including our drilling intervention, formerly down hole, our drill pipe our wire pipe and our wellsite services business delivered a new record results for customer revenue, which explains both sequential and year-over-year increases. Operating profit for this segment was $276 million or 18.1% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially but up 20 basis points over the prior year. The slight sequential decline in margin was expected as the holidays invariably lead to underabsorption in our manufacturing and service facilities. For the quarter, EBITDA for this segment was $387 million or 25.3% of sales. For the full year 2014, Wellbore Technologies posted record revenues of $5.7 billion, up 12% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $1 billion or 18.3% of sales, which represented 31% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven by strong deliveries of intervention stimulation equipment, which were up 24% and floating production equipment which is up 29%, as well as solid sales of Fiberglas systems and subsea production equipment. On a year-over-year basis, most businesses within the segment delivered low to mid-teens percentage growth, with the exception of our intervention and stimulation equipment business, which posted a 40% gain over the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating profit for the segment was $215 million or 16.2% of revenues, which was up 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 and up 30 basis points from the third quarter of -- from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter EBITDA for this segment was $273 million or 20.6% of sales. For the full year 2014, the Completion & Production Solutions segment posted record revenues of $4.6 billion, up 7.8% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $700 million or 15.1% of sales. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment. During the quarter, the segment secured $469 million in new orders, which were more than offset by record shipments of $776 million out of backlog, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $1.8 billion. Sequentially, orders for production-related equipment increased slightly. However, this increase was more than offset by a 45% reduction in orders for intervention and stimulation equipment into the North American land market. Overall come it was another solid quarter that marked the end of a transformative and record-breaking year for NOV. So like Clay, I would like to thank each and every member of the NOV family for their commitment, their focus and hard work, in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. 
As we move into 2015, it's care that the sharp decline in oil prices would negatively impact our business. While we have some visibility into the first quarter of 2015, our forecast for the balance of the year seems to be changing by the day. For the first quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenues could decline in the high single-digit percentage range and that margins could erode on lower volumes. A higher percentage of Brazil-related revenue and additional expenses associated with customer requested scheduling changes, with some customers requesting that we slightly delay projects and others actually asking us to expedite deliveries. And from an order perspective, we believe that the pace and composition of orders could look somewhat similar to the pace and composition of orders that we received in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, continued market uncertainty could lead to indefinite delays on some of these expected orders which could result in even lower booking sequentially. 
For our Rig Aftermarket business as we move into the first quarter 2015, we believe that revenues could actually decline slightly for 2 reasons: Number one, our customers clearly started scaling back in the fourth quarter as evidence by the noticeable reduction in bookings for spare parts and fluids and expands, and two, we are facing significant and rising pricing pressure from our customers, which could lead and probably will lead to some pricing concessions and negatively impact our top line and our margins. For our Wellbore Technologies segment, it's important to remember that this segment is driven by drilling activity. More rigs drilling more wells and more footage creates more opportunity for the various businesses within Wellbore Technologies. Unfortunately, given the precipitous declines in oil prices and the active rig count, our customers are dramatically cutting spending while simultaneously demanding significant discounts. As such, for the first quarter, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could decline in the mid-teens percentage range, with decrementals in the 50% to 60% range. 
And, finally, for our Completion & Production Solutions segment, we believe that first quarter 2015 revenues could decline by as much as 25%, with decrementals in the mid-30% range as we expect sharp declines in our higher margin intervention  and stimulation equipment business as orders for coil tubing units and pressure pumping units and consumables have virtually disappeared. 
Predicting the full year 2015 is impossible in this environment. Still, I will make a few comments about each segment that I hope are helpful. At our analyst day in November when oil was a $75 a barrel included a chart essentially forecasted 10% year-over-year revenue decline in our Rig Systems segment and in the Q&A section we specifically stated that despite this 10% decline in revenue, Rig Systems revenues could hold fairly steady in that 20% range. Unfortunately after watching oil prices plummet below $50 a barrel, our underlying assumptions have changed. In November, we expected about $7 billion to $7.5 billion of our third quarter ending backlog to flow out as revenue in 2015, and we expect demand for land rigs and for discrete components for both land and offshore to remain strong in the fourth quarter 2014 and well into 2015. But as evidenced by the $470 million in fourth quarter 2015 bookings and the recent announcements from our land and offshore drilling customers, the previously expected booked internal revenue in 2015 is now clearly in question. Additionally as you might expect, we've received requests from some customers to delay specific projects in shipments on select projects which could ultimately push some revenue out of 2015 and into 2016. And since we may not receive the higher-margin book in turn orders that we expected and since we may have to juggle manufacturing, delivery and installation and commissioning schedules, all of which could add costs, we believe that margins could tick down slightly on the additional revenue reduction. 
For our Rig Aftermarket segment, we do not really know what to expect from the top line. However, we know that rig counts are falling and customers are uncertain about their future prospects and when customers are uncertain about their future prospects, they often curtail spending, consume existing inventories, cannibalize underutilized assets and indefinitely postpone upgrades. So when you couple that customer behavior with pricing concessions, we do not expect to see the same mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth that we have come to enjoy in previous years, and we believe that margins could erode slightly from 2014 levels. 
Because it's based on drilling activity and because we do not know how quickly or how far the rig count will ultimately fall, forecasting the full year for Wellbore Technologies segment is equally challenging. If we wanted to use the 2008 to 2009 timeframe as a proxy for 2014 to 2015, one could predict revenues to fall between 20% and 25% with steep 50% to 60% decremental margins. As a point of reference, Wellbore Technologies segment revenues for the full year 2009, excluding non-recurring items were 9.8%. Obviously, if faced with a top line decline similar to 2008 to 2009, we will make every effort to maximize profitability and improve upon the margins that we posted in 2009. However, it's important to remember that this segment is already facing substantial pricing pressure, and it carries a heavy D&A load, including manufacturing and service facility infrastructure, sizable rental fleets and intangibles associated with prior acquisitions that work together to challenge profitability in a severe downturn.  And finally our Completion & Production Solutions segment is perhaps the most difficult to forecast due to the fact that a supply has both long lead time capital equipment and short cycle consumables to support a very volatile completions market and a sometimes frustratingly slow to materialize offshore production market. As we move throughout 2015, we believe that demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing units will most likely be very soft in the U.S. with pockets of opportunity internationally. And we think the demand for floating and subsea production equipment will continue to be lumpy. But since we are entering the year with a reasonably healthy backlog, we would expect revenues to slightly outperform the decline in the overall market. And depending on the suddenness and magnitude of that top line decline, we believe the decremental leverage for the segment could be between 40% and 50%. 
So 2015 could certainly prove to be challenging. But as Clay stated and as we've clearly demonstrated in the past, we remain confident in the ability of this organization to adapt and not just survive but thrive in a cyclical downturn. So with that, let's turn to some of the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially but increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.1%. For the full year 2014, gross margin also improved 60 basis points to 27.1%. SG&A decreased $7 million sequentially but increased $46 million year-over-year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A declined 40 basis points sequentially and increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 9.2%. 
For the full year 2014, SG&A increased $214 million or 11.7% but as a percentage of sales, SG&A actually declined slightly to 9.5%. Other items, which includes the impairment of some indefinite lives trade names within our Wellbore Technologies segment, as well as of the loss associated with the sale of a non-core industrial business that was acquired in the Robbins & Myers transaction were $163 million in the quarter. For the year, other items were $214 million versus $53 million in 2013. 
Interest expense was flat sequentially at $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. As compared to 2013, interest expense decreased $6 million and interest income increased $6 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV increased $7 million sequentially to $16 million as the plant was once again fully operational following its annual maintenance in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, equity income was flat and compared to the full year 2013, equity income declined $5 million to $58 million. For the first quarter and full year 2015, we believe that equity income will fall as demand for drill pipe and therefore green tube will moderate. 
Other expense for the quarter was $20 million which represents a $29 million delta sequentially but is more consistent with historical trends. For the full year, other expense was $32 million versus $30 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1% which was 70 basis points lower than the 28.8% rate that we posted in the third quarter of 2014 and 200 to 300 basis points lower than historical trends and our expectations. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been close to the 30%. Therefore as we move into 2015, we believe that 30% to 31% continues to be a realistic estimate of NOV's effective tax rate. 
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you will see that eliminations were $556 million for the quarter, down slightly from $569 million in the third quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $229 million for the quarter, down $6 million sequentially on a lower volume of intersegment revenues. As compared to the full year 2013, eliminations increased 38.6% on higher volumes and unallocated expenses and eliminations increased 31.7%. And finally if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you'll see that depreciation and amortization expensive for the quarter was $199 million, up $1 million from the third quarter and up [ph] $4 million from the previous year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization expense was $778 million, up 5.4% from 2013. EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. For the full year 2014, EBITDA was a record $4.6 billion up 13.9% from 2013. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.4 billion, down $125 million or 2.3% sequentially. Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable decreased $66 million or 1.5% sequentially despite the $122 million sequential increase in revenue. Inventory declined $183 million or 3.3% sequentially as reductions in Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions were partially offset by inventory growth in Rig Aftermarket. 
Also leading to a sequential reduction in working capital, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $138 million. Unfortunately, due to the sequential decline in bookings for offshore new-builds, costs incurred on major projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing, which resulted in a $297 million sequential decline in customer financing. 
For the quarter, the company generated $736 million in cash flow from operations. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $231 million up almost 38% sequentially due to better-than-expected progress on several significant ongoing construction projects. In the quarter, we also invested $110 million in 3 acquisitions. We made dividend payments of $196 million and we spent $779 million to repurchase shares. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, down $555 million sequentially, but up $100 million from the prior year and we ended the year in a net cash position of $370 million as we were able to make previously mentioned investments without assuming any incremental debt. Of the $3.5 billion in cash, almost 16% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31, 2014. 
As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in our 10 year [ph] strategies, however, we will do so at a more measured pace than previously envisaged. As a result, we will expect to reduce year to year capital spending by 15%. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

Given the pace of orders, we think it's probably going to be closer to that $7 billion range in terms of revenue flow and out of backlog this year, based on what we see today. Now we could received some orders here in the next few months that we can turn into revenue before the end of the year, but right now, it's looking pretty soft.

But and I would add to that too, our own suppliers were in discussions with reducing with the prices they charge us. We're hesitant though to wrap margin improvement around that scenario because no doubt we're going to continue to see price pressure and face challenges that are coming out of the current slow market."

When you think about the decline in oil today and people liked to reference 2009, but as we stand today, people are rig rates are coming down much more quickly in general than the backlogs in the offshore drillers should be much less than that time frame and there's probably legitimate discussion that offshore rig rates could grow close to cash breakeven. How do you think about Rig Systems and orders over the next 2 to 3 years if that happens? How do you think shipyards will react with a price standpoint. Last time, they reduced price which helped, but will it really help if rig rates are at such a depressed level that even they bother to reduce price because no one is going to order anyway?"

And as I said in the opening remarks, our plan is to manage to the market realities kind of quarter-by-quarter. We have a great backlog which we'll earn off over the next several quarters. As we find ourselves let's say this time next year without a resumption in orders in the offshore world, we expect 2 things to happen. One is our installation and commissioning efforts around the rigs that are being built will continue strong through 2015 and will end at 2016. As that starts to wind down a little bit though, we'll have good opportunities to pivot and refocus the technical capabilities of that group and the infrastructure that supports that group towards SPSs which we do see rising in spite of the market challenges. We see opportunities to pivot and refocus that group towards more onshore aftermarket support. I think there's a great potential out there for NOV to build on its franchise in the land side and provide better aftermarket support to those customers. Likewise, on manufacturing, we expect to pivot and kind of refocus in the aftermarket opportunity around that and then secondly -- that will help a lot, but secondly, we're going to be sizing to what the market dictates. As I also mentioned in my opening comments, we're outsourcing more than half of our machining work and rig, for instance. And so we have a lot of sort of flexible or flex supply chain after the supports and efforts we can diminish. And then thirdly, we got 2 other big segments that have different cyclical behaviors. And so a recovery in rig counts in 2016 would do a lot to very rapidly lift demand by Wellbore Technologies, for machining capabilities assembly, likewise, Completion & Production Solutions is on a little different cyclical trajectory. So we have -- by having 3 different segments that has different cyclical behaviors, it gives us an opportunity to refocus resources into places that may need them."

A lot of credit capacity and expectation that as business slows we will have cash coming out of working capital and off of our balance sheet, plus $14.3 billion backlog translates to a pretty significant margin embedded in that backlog, which will turn to cash over the next year or 2. So we kind of entered this downturn with a lot of resources, and I think what it means is we have the capability to really do all of the above. And so we have very intentionally stepped up our focus on M&A, mostly around the smaller company opportunities. Because frankly, they are more doable in this kind of market downturn. i think it's challenging for a public company to enter into an agreement to sell itself if it's not distressed, when its stock price is way below its 52-week high. And so it makes it difficult to do a larger transaction in this kind of environment. That's not to say like I mentioned earlier to Jim. That's not to say that we're continuing conversations and surveying the landscape out there. But in terms of how we prioritize, I think we can do all the above and do so in a way that doesn't sacrifice future flexibility. And do so in a way that keeps our powder dry for those opportunities as they arise. So that's kind of the thought process that we're going through. Specifically with regard to the share buyback, I mean this is the company we know best. We can buy shares with no purchase premium and we can size those transactions to whatever size we feel are comfortable with, which is why at our analyst day, we sort of linked the application of capital in the share buyback program to the repatriation of cash from overseas."

Actually, thankfully for us, it really hasn't created a big impact on our programs. If you remember back a few years ago when Petrobras settled this up, they set up a separate financing arm called Sete in Brazil that's actually the customer, and it went out to secure its equity partner investors and secured its bank financings and kind of -- and so it's sort of moving along separately without virtually -- there's virtually no capital support from Petrobras into those projects to construct the rigs. Where the support comes is in the contracts to operate those rigs once they're delivered. And that's still a couple of years out. But based upon Sete placing orders to construct these rigs with their partners, shipyards jumped in the fray and concluding a couple of new shipyards that were constructed for this program. And so those have been proceeding along relatively smoothly. That's not to say without some delays and some issues and some challenges that we fully expected, but by and large, those projects are moving ahead, we expect the first rig to be delivered, I think Q3 or Q4 this year. And the first of 22 rigs that were signed up to deliver and the specific challenges that, that group of projects and shipyards have faced have been more around cost overruns on the construction of the shipyards. That led to a few payment delays for us. We're working through that and the good news here within the past few weeks, a couple of financing packages have been made available to Sete. I mentioned in my opening comments that the Development Bank of Brazil, think the Central Bank is involved, the Banc of Brazil and some of the Asian partners to some of the shipyards are also financing the completion of the construction of those yards. So net, net, we're in pretty decent shape. But I think important for NOV shareholders is that we are ahead. We received more payments than we have delivered equipment into these projects. And so very important to us that we maintain that position from a risk management. So we're in pretty good shape on this, Robin."

This morning, we announced that the company earned $1.39 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. Excluding transaction and asset impairment charges, earnings were a record $1.69 per fully diluted share, an increase of 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. EBITDA on this basis improved 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. For the full year 2014, GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $5.82. Excluding other items and impairment charges, earnings were a record $6.07 per fully diluted share, up 12% from the prior year. EBITDA for the year, excluding other items and impairment charges, was a record $4.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year on the same basis. 
Looking forward, we obviously faced some significant challenges in the markets that we serve, and we will be discussing these through the next hour. But first, I want to take a moment and reflect on the company's accomplishments in 2014 and say thanks to the world's best oilfield services team. 
NOV completed the spin out of our distribution services business to our shareholders as NOW Inc. in May which led us to reorganize our remaining business along 4 new reporting segments and promote several executives into new leadership positions. Our new segment architecture is around customer axis which opened up new strategic possibilities for us, so our leadership teams spent the summer developing long-term strategies for each business. We presented these at our first Investor Day in November where we also laid out ambitious 5-year goals. 2014 also saw us announce a large increase in our dividend, lifting our payout ratio to within the range of 30%, as well as the authorization of a $3 billion stock buyback. Given the pace of change here through 2014, it would have been easy to have been distracted. I think the pace of change here makes NOV's 2014 record results doubly impressive. We had several business units post record annual and record quarterly results in 2014. I would like to express my gratitude to every one of our 60,000 employees who continue to execute exceptionally well on behalf of our customers, despite all these changes, to deliver great financial results for our shareholders. Thank you. 
As we look forward though, we face a tough market. With oil prices down more than 50%, our customers are quickly cutting spending, and the downturn we face will be severe in 2015 and possibly beyond. Drilling activity is falling sharply and our visibility is limited. The industry finds itself in this downturn, we believe, because rapidly growing North American oil supply, coupled with slowing demand in the OECD, slowing demand growth in China and other emerging economies and a strong U.S. dollar, all contributed to a supply-demand imbalance for oil late last year. With regards to slow oil demand in Europe and emerging economies, significantly lower energy costs were a meaningful widespread economic stimulus. As economies in Europe and Asia eventually strengthen, low oil prices and rising economic activity will spur oil demand growth from these regions. 
Second, we do not believe that global excess production capacity is excessive by historical standards. We do not face the kind of structural global overhang the industry faced in 1986 when Saudi Arabian production had been curtailed down to about 4 million barrels of oil per day and spare global oil capacity exceeded 15% of demand. We believe that this downturn will be more like 2002 or 2009. In both prior instances, recovery came within about 2 years. 
Third, we believe the recent swing source of incremental global oil supply is coming from North American shales. The production type curve from these basins exhibit extraordinarily steep decline rates, which is well-documented across thousands of wells in multiple shale basins. New shale reservoirs exhibit perhaps the highest national decline rates from any major source of oil in the industry's modern history. We see North American shale drilling slowing dramatically and quickly, soon the rate of new shale wells coming online will decline. And the 4 million barrels of oil per day from U.S. shales will then begin to decline and will decline steeply. We believe this could lead to modest oil price recovery as early as late 2015. However, we expect shale production to continue to grow through the first half of 2015 before it begins to fall as the remaining inventory of well bores is completed and brought online, which means the recovery, once it arrives, may be a slower grind higher despite the steep decline curve behavior of shale oil. 
So in summary, a significant oil demand component to the imbalance, driven by macroeconomic conditions; lower oil costs contributing to eventual economic recovery; a major source of supply from extraordinarily high decline curve reservoirs; and a sharp drilling reduction response from the oil industry are a pretty good set of ingredients with which to bake an oil price recovery scenario. Nevertheless, we acknowledge many factors to keep oil prices down for longer. Deteriorating global economic conditions, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar or the return to market of oil from certain sideline countries are a few that come to mind. However, given the speed at which we see drilling activity slowing, it is very difficult for us to imagine that we will not see a significant oil supply response relatively soon. We don't believe the world can sustainably grow its oil supply with prices below say 80 -- $75 a barrel. And with prices below $60, oil production will begin to contract. Since oil supply growth will eventually be required at some point in the future, it stands to reason that oil prices must eventually cycle back up above $75 over the long-run. 
Given our short term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach to 2015 will be to focus on what we can control. We plan to manage NOV to the market quarter-to-quarter in view of near-term orders and activity while we steadily reduce costs as utilization levels permit, while also continuing to advance the long-term strategic goals we outlined at our Investor Day. We will manage to the realities of the markets we serve, but we plan to emerge from this cyclical downturn a better company, achieving new higher levels of operational excellence. 
The record fourth quarter results that we just announced reflect very little of the impending downturn. In fact, many of our operations spent the fourth quarter working 3 shifts 24/7 to meet our delivery obligations. Through 2014, we shipped record levels of top drives, blowout preventers fiberglass pipe, jacking systems and numerous other products. In January, we did begin to see the drop in activity affecting our operations in a more widespread way, most acutely in Wellbore Technologies, but really, all segments seeing some impact. In view of the challenges ahead, we are beginning to bring work in from our suppliers to keep our own facilities better loaded. So for instance, right now, 52% of our machining requirements within rig systems and aftermarket are outsourced. As work declines, we will be repositioning some of that work into our own facilities.  We're examining opportunities to consolidate facilities where possible, and we are working with our suppliers to improve efficiencies and cost as our customers press us for cost savings for their supply chains.  I have tremendous confidence in the NOV team's ability to manage through the downturn and reduce costs. 
Although we have new leadership and new positions throughout our new organization, I will stress that these figures are not new to NOV, nor are they new to the industry or to cyclical downturns. By my count, this will be the sixth cyclical downturn we have faced through our careers. Unfortunately, despite our cost reduction measures we will nevertheless expect to see steep decrementals through 2015, as pricing pressure and low absorption on lower volumes will pressure margins. 
Orders for all our products has slowed sharply: Offshore, land, drilling, completion and production. Customers are delaying purchases of both capital and consumables wherever possible, seeking to conserve cash in the face of market uncertainty. We soon expect to see our customers begin to cannibalize existing equipment for capital components. For instance, pull a top drive off an idled rig within their fleet rather than place a new order for a new one with NOV in order to keep another contracted rig in need of a top drive working. Our customers will raid the spares inventory from their idled rigs to support those that are contracted and contributing -- and continuing to work, rather than place a spares order with us. They will redirect drill pipe, bits, jars, shakers and other kit rather than place new orders with us. History teaches us to expect this behavior to continue for at least the next couple of quarters, meaning orders will continue to be slow and our book-to-bill and Rig Systems well below 1. 
However, this behavior is not sustainable over the long term. Drilling consumes rigs much like driving consumes automobile. The rate of consumption of capital equipment and consumables is declining with drilling activity, but customer spending always seems to overreact through cyclical downturns by living off their inventory and postponing maintenance and upgrades wherever they can. That only works for so long. Maintenance and upgrades can be deferred but cannot be postponed indefinitely for drilling rigs, so demand will return. In the past, this behavior has fueled demand surges for the kit NOV provides. Our markets change quickly in both directions. 
Also, we see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their rigs to meet contractual requirements or simply differentiate their rigs in a race to offer the most efficient drilling rigs. There remains interest. It's only academic for the time being in what the next big thing is for drilling: Configurable drill floors, closed loop automated drilling systems, automated pipe tailing and stand transfer of vehicles for land rigs, retrievable subsea BOP pods, low-cost mid-water floater designs, concepts which NOV continues to advance in accordance with our 10-year goals. Offshore, we are seeing customers defer some of their SPS survey work, although our total volume of SPS work continues to rise. As we've described in the past, offshore rigs are required to undergo shipyard surveys and obtain OEM certificates of compliance and activity called a special periodic survey, or SPS, to maintain their class designations and be qualified to drill in most markets.  In an $80 oil world, contractors will proceed with the SPS on an uncontracted rig to ensure it is qualified for any potential contract which may arise which would require a pressing spud day. In a $50-oil world, contractors are incrementally less willing to invest in the SPS for an uncontracted rig and be more willing to forgo the possibility of missing a quick spud day contract. And on the side, I'll note that when the recovery comes to the offshore drilling market, shipyard capacity to execute SPSs may become a very scarce resource. 
In a $50-oil world, contractors become much more circumspect about all investments in older rigs. We expect to see even more rig retirements, both land and offshore, both announced and unannounced, in addition to those that we've seen already. This phenomenon has been witnessed in every category of drilling rigs passing through periodic cyclical downturns and incrementally contributes to better supply-demand balance for the fleets. 
Rig Systems posted new orders of $470 million, or a book-to-bill of just 21%, reflecting the customer mindset I just discussed. This resulted in a Rig Systems backlog of $12.5 billion to start 2015. This is a high backlog for NOV by historical standards, 16% higher than we carried into the 2009 downturn for instance. We expect it to partly, but not fully mitigate the effect of lower orders through 2015 on our day-to-day operations in rig systems. We foresee revenue out of backlog remaining strong through the first quarter of 2015 north of $2 billion, but beginning to decline modestly in the second quarter, more steeply in the third, fourth quarters of 2015. While 2015 orders will be slow, we do continue to see modest demand for certain markets like 20,000-psi deepwater, Middle Eastern land markets, Mexico and Argentina. 
Orders for Completion & Production Solutions did better through the fourth quarter, posting a book-to-bill of 60% on $469 million in orders, which resulted in a backlog of $1.8 billion to start 2015. On the production side, we continue to advance discussions around some large FPSO projects in spite of the low oil prices. In fact, the downturn and the troubled offshore project execution performance by the majors and NOCs has opened the door to new ideas amongst our large E&P customers. There's growing interest around doing things differently in deepwater developments to drive lower costs. We're accepting lots of invitations from majors to discuss our modular approach to vessel construction, to bring modern supply chain management techniques to bear to produce better results. Necessity is the mother of invention, and this market is wide open to new approaches. Our new approach is to offer a timely integrated package of NOV kit to minimize the interface conflicts brought about by the fragmented supply chain approach currently used to build these vessels. We seek to recycle designs and avoid reinventing the wheel for each new vessel which inevitably leads to unplanned manufacturing costs and delays. 
NOV has a tremendous track record of success in bringing this modular package approach to the construction of offshore drilling rigs through the last decade. Our extensive experience in working closely with shipyards to execute, install and commission these complex construction projects uniquely positions NOV to help the industry pioneer a better way. Although a large integrated package FPSO order for NOV is still a ways away, we've made great progress in securing customer buy-in through our new approach on 2 specific FPSO projects, which we ultimately expect to turn into firm orders perhaps as early as late 2015. 
For both the Rig Systems and Completion & Production Solutions  segments, we are glad to be able to carry strong backlogs into this downturn. Except for minor exceptions, the firm contracts governing our backlog projects do not permit cancellation for convenience. 
In 2009, we saw about 4% of our backlog evaporate, not really from cancellations, but rather from customer payment defaults. We expect a vast majority of our current backlog to be executed in accordance with the agreed terms like we experienced 6 years ago. In certain instances, we are considering customer requests for delivery delays, which can help us better manage costs in our currently stretched supply chain. But generally, we expect the continued on-time execution of our backlog to continue. Our 2009 stress test provides good empirical evidence for this outlook. 
Our 22 Brazil Atlas project floating rigs constitute about $3.5 billion of our backlog. We are ahead on progress payments on each of these projects, meaning we have collected more than we have invested in the inventory delivered on these as planned as we continue to fabricate components. We will begin installation and commissioning operations soon and are commencing riser manufacturing in Brazil currently. 
Generally, progress has been steady, but a little slower than originally planned which has not surprised us. While we have had some payment delays with some of our Brazilian shipyard customers who are building out their new shipyard facilities, we are confident in the successful completion of these rigs due to the financing package provided to [indiscernible] shipyards customers by the Brazilian Development Bank and a consortium of banks a few weeks ago to fund the next 18 months of construction. Additionally, the shipyards have Asian partners who are, in some instances, providing additional capital to complete the construction of their facilities. The country of Brazil is all in on this and the rigs will be completed successfully. 
Like I said earlier, NOV will emerge from this downturn a stronger and better company. We are continuing to advance new technologies like closed-loop automated training, which has significantly improved drilling performance through several pilot programs. Other innovations like our water oil recovery system for produced waters, thermal cuttings and absorption technologies, TUNDRA MAX mud coolers, automated pipe handling equipment for land rigs and retrievable pods for subsea BOPs will continue to make the oilfield safer and more productive. 
We have a strong balance sheet to help weather this downturn. We are seeking to invest opportunistically through this downturn. We continue to pursue our singles and doubles acquisition strategy, which improves our capabilities and global reach in our technology portfolio. We have 7 letters of intent in place and probably triple that in potential prospects. We also began investing in a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. Today, we have repurchased over 11.6 million shares of NOV for $779 million, which is a 2.7% reduction in our share count. Thus far, we have been able to accomplish this using cash on our balance sheet, which we have been able to repatriate from overseas locations. The $2.2 billion remaining on our current authorization, we plan to continue to repurchase NOV shares through the downturn, including, if necessary, using modest levels of debt from time to time to bridge to the next opportunity to repatriate cash from overseas.
Importantly, we acknowledged at our recent Investor Day that this is a cyclical business, and once or twice every decade, oil, as a commodity, tests its microeconomic variable cash cost floor of the marginal barrel. In setting our long-term strategies, we intentionally look through the cyclical downturn to entrepreneurially focus on actionable opportunities that we see ahead. My sixth cyclical downturn has not dissuaded me from the basic pieces we outlined in November, in line with ExxonMobil's outlook 2040 study that the world's population will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion by the year 2040, economic growth will continue, standards of living will rise, oil and gas production will grow from a combination of shales and deepwater to fuel the world's appetite for energy and a better life. Specifically, the Exxon study calls for 25% growth in oil and 65% growth in gas through the next 25 years. In the near term, the E&P industry will sharpen its focus on improving economic efficiency and marginal cost of production of oil from all sources of oil as it has always done. And as the leading provider of innovation and technology and industrial capability to this critical entrepreneurial industry, National Oilwell Varco will play a key role in making that happen, and emerge better-positioned for the inevitable upturn. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy to take you through our fourth quarter and outlook. Jeremy?"

Since Clay already covered the consolidated results, I'll just dive straight into our segment operating performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year December 31, 2014, and then attempt to provide a little color on the outlook for 2015. 
The Rig Systems segment generated quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% from a record third quarter as revenue out of backlog on offshore projects was not quite as strong sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 7% due to heightened demand for high-spec land rigs and equipment and our recent capacity additions, which have enabled us to convert more revenue out of backlog over the prior year. Operating profit for the segment was $511 million and operating margins were 20%, which were flat with the previous quarter despite the 4% sequential decline in revenue and up 90 basis points from the prior year.  
Fourth quarter EBITDA for this segment was $534 million or 20.9% of sales. For the full year 2014, Rig Systems posted record revenues of $9.8 billion, up 16.5% over 2013; and produced operating profit of almost $2 billion, or 20.3% of sales, which resulted in year-over-year flow through or leverage of 27%. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the fourth quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized $2.3 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured $470 million in new orders, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $12.5 billion. In the quarter, we secured 3 each drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, 5 each land rigs and a smattering of offshore land components. Of the total $12.5 billion in quarter-ending backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 91% is destined for international markets. 
The Rig Aftermarket segment posted record revenues of $850 million in the fourth quarter 2014, up 2% sequentially and up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013. As our large and growing installed base of equipment, combined with the investments that we have made in additional personnel, training, global infrastructure and inventory, have resulted in solid growth, operating profit for the segment was $245 million or 28.8% of revenue. That's up 140 basis points sequentially and up 300 basis points from the prior year on more favorable mix, with a higher percentage of high-margin service work and an unseasonably lower percentage of lower margin repair work. For the quarter, EBITDA for this segment was $252 million or 29.6% of revenue.  
For the full year 2014, Rig Aftermarket posted record revenues of $3.2 billion or 19.7% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $882 million or 27.4% of sales, which represented 29% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment posted record revenues of $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 11.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In the quarter, several businesses, including our drilling intervention, formerly downhole; our Grant Prideco drill pipe; our IntelliServ wired pipe; and our wellside services business delivered record or near-record results for customer revenue, which explains both the sequential and year-over-year increases. 
Operating profit for this segment was $276 million, or 18.1% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially, but up 20 basis points over the prior year. The slight sequential decline in margin was expected as the holidays invariably lead to under-absorption in our manufacturing and service facilities. For the quarter, EBITDA for this segment was $387 million or 25.3% of sales. 
For the full year 2014, Wellbore Technologies posted record revenues of $5.7 billion, up 12% over 2013; and produced operating profit of $1 billion, or 18.3% of sales, which represented 31% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven by strong deliveries of intervention stimulation equipment, which were up 24% and floating production equipment which is up 29%, as well as solid sales of fiberglass systems and subsea production equipment. On a year-over-year basis, most businesses within this segment delivered low to mid-teens percentage growth, with the exception of our intervention and stimulation equipment business, which posted a 40% gain over the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Operating profit for this segment was $215 million, or 16.2% of revenues, which was up 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 and up 30 basis points from the third quarter of -- from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter EBITDA for this segment was $273 million or 20.6% of sales. For the full year 2014, the Completion & Production Solutions segment posted record revenues of $4.6 billion, up 7.8% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $700 million or 15.1% of sales. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment. During the quarter, the segment secured $469 million in new orders, which were more than offset by record shipments of $776 million out of backlog, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $1.8 billion. Sequentially, orders for production-related equipment increased slightly. However, this increase was more than offset by a 45% reduction in orders for intervention and stimulation equipment into the North American land market. Overall, it was another solid quarter that marked the end of a transformative and record-breaking year for NOV. So like Clay, I would like to thank each and every member of the NOV family for their commitment and focus and hard work in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. 
As we move into 2015, it's clear that the sharp decline in oil prices will negatively impact our business. While we have some visibility into the first quarter of 2015, our forecast for the balance of the year seems to be changing by the day. For the first quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenues could decline in the high single-digit percentage range and that margins could erode on lower volumes. A higher percentage of Brazil-related revenue and additional expenses associated with customer-requested scheduling changes, with some customers requesting that we slightly delay projects, and others actually asking us to expedite deliveries. And from an order perspective, we believe that the pace and composition of orders could look somewhat similar to the pace and composition of orders that we received in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, continued market uncertainty could lead to indefinite delays on some of these expected orders which could result in even lower booking sequentially. 
For our Rig Aftermarket business as we move into the first quarter 2015, we believe that revenues could actually decline slightly for 2 reasons: Number one, our customers clearly started scaling back in the fourth quarter, as evidenced by the noticeable reduction in bookings for spare parts and fluid and expendables; and two, we are facing significant and rising pricing pressure from our customers, which could lead and probably will lead to some pricing concessions and negatively impact our top line and our margins. 
For our Wellbore Technologies segment, it's important to remember that this segment is driven by drilling activity. More rigs drilling more wells and more footage creates more opportunity for the various businesses within Wellbore Technologies. Unfortunately, given the precipitous declines in oil prices and the active rig count, our customers are dramatically cutting spending while simultaneously demanding significant discounts. As such, for the first quarter, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could decline in the mid-teens percentage range, with decrementals in the 50% to 60% range. 
And finally, for our Completion & Production Solutions segment, we believe that first quarter 2015 revenues could decline by as much as 25%, with decrementals in the mid-30% range as we expect sharp declines in our higher margin intervention and stimulation equipment business as orders for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment and consumables have virtually disappeared. 
Predicting the full year 2015 is impossible in this environment. Still, I will make a few comments about each segment that I hope are helpful. 
At our Analyst Day in November, when oil was a $75 a barrel, we included a chart that essentially forecasted a 10% year-over-year revenue decline in our Rig Systems segment. And in the Q&A section, we specifically stated that despite this 10% decline in revenue, Rig Systems margins could hold fairly steady at that 20% range. Unfortunately after watching oil prices plummet below $50 a barrel, our underlying assumptions have changed. In November, we expected about $7 billion to $7.5 billion of our third quarter-ending backlog to flow out as revenue in 2015, and we expect the demand for land rigs and for discrete components for both land and offshore to remain strong in the fourth quarter 2014 and well into 2015. But as evidenced by the $470 million in fourth quarter 2015 bookings and the recent announcements from our land and offshore drilling customers, the previously expected book in turn revenue in 2015 is now clearly in question. Additionally, as you might expect, we've received requests from some customers to delay specific projects and shipments on select projects which could ultimately push some revenue out of 2015 and into 2016. And since we may not receive the higher-margin book in turn orders that we expected and since we may have to juggle manufacturing, delivery and installation and commissioning schedules, all of which could add cost, we believe that margins could tick down slightly on the additional revenue reduction. 
For our Rig Aftermarket segment, we do not really know what to expect from the top line. However, we know that rig counts are falling and that customers are uncertain about their future prospects. And when customers are uncertain about their future prospects, they often curtail spending, consume existing inventories, cannibalize underutilized assets and indefinitely postpone upgrades. So when you couple that customer behavior with pricing concessions, we do not expect to see the same mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth that we have come to enjoy in previous years, and we believe that margins could erode slightly from 2014 levels. 
Because it's based on drilling activity and because we do not know how quickly or how far the rig count will ultimately fall, forecasting the full year for Wellbore Technologies segment is equally challenging. If one wanted to use the 2008 to 2009 timeframe as a proxy for 2014 to 2015, one could predict revenues to fall between 20% and 25%, with steep 50% to 60% decremental margins. As a point of reference, Wellbore Technologies segment revenues for the full year 2009, excluding non-recurring items were 9.8%. Obviously, if faced with a top line decline similar to 2008 to 2009, we will make every effort to maximize profitability and improve upon the margins that we posted in 2009. However, it's important to remember that this segment is already facing substantial pricing pressure and it carries a heavy D&A load, including manufacturing and service facility infrastructure, sizable rental fleets and intangibles associated with prior acquisitions that work together to challenge profitability in a severe downturn.  
And finally, our Completion & Production Solutions segment is perhaps the most difficult to forecast due to the fact that it supplies both long lead time capital equipment and short cycle consumables to support a very volatile completions market and a sometimes frustratingly-slow-to-materialize offshore production market. As we move throughout 2015, we believe that demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing units will most likely be very soft in the U.S., with pockets of opportunity internationally. And we think that demand for floating and subsea production equipment will continue to be lumpy. But since we are entering the year with a reasonably healthy backlog, we would expect revenues to slightly outperform the decline in the overall market. And depending on the suddenness and magnitude of that top line decline, we believe that decremental leverage for this segment could be between 40% and 50%. 
So 2015 could certainly prove to be challenging. But as Clay stated and as we've clearly demonstrated in the past, we remain confident in the ability of this organization to adapt, and not just survive, but thrive in a cyclical downturn. 
So with that, let's turn to some of the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter 2014 income statement. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially but increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.1%. For the full year 2014, gross margin also improved 60 basis points to 27.1%. SG&A decreased $7 million sequentially but increased $46 million year-over-year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A declined 40 basis points sequentially and increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 9.2%. 
For the full year 2014, SG&A increased $214 million or 11.7%, but as a percentage of sales, SG&A actually declined slightly to 9.5%. Other items, which includes the impairment of some indefinite lives trade names within our Wellbore Technologies segment, as well as the loss associated with the sale of a non-core industrial business that was acquired in the Robbins & Myers transaction, were $163 million in the quarter. For the year, other items were $214 million versus $53 million in 2013. 
Interest expense was flat sequentially at $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. As compared to 2013, interest expense decreased $6 million and interest income increased $6 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV increased $7 million sequentially to $16 million, as the plant was once again fully operational following its annual maintenance in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, equity income was flat; and compared to the full year 2013, equity income declined $5 million to $58 million. For the first quarter and full year 2015, we believe that equity income will fall as demand for drill pipe and, therefore, green tube will moderate. 
Other expense for the quarter was $20 million, which represents a $29 million delta sequentially but is more consistent with historical trends. For the full year, other expense was $32 million versus $30 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1% which was 70 basis points lower than the 28.8% rate that we posted in the third quarter of 2014, and 200 to 300 basis points lower than historical trends and our expectations. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been close to the 30%. Therefore, as we move into 2015, we believe that 30% to 31% continues to be a realistic estimate of NOV's effective tax rate. 
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you'll see that eliminations were $556 million for the quarter, down slightly from $569 million in the third quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $229 million for the quarter, down $6 million sequentially on a lower volume of intersegment revenues. As compared to the full year 2013, eliminations increased 38.6% on higher volumes and unallocated expenses and eliminations increased 31.7%. 
And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you will see that depreciation and amortization expensive in the quarter was $199 million, up $1 million from the third quarter and up $4 million from the previous year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization expense was $778 million, up 5.4% from 2013. EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. For the full year 2014, EBITDA was a record $4.6 billion, up 13.9% from 2013. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.4 billion, down $125 million or 2.3% sequentially. Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable decreased $66 million or 1.5% sequentially despite the $122 million sequential increase in revenue. Inventory declined $183 million or 3.3% sequentially as reductions in Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions were partially offset by inventory growth in Rig Aftermarket. 
Also leading to a sequential reduction in working capital, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $138 million. Unfortunately, due to the sequential decline in bookings for offshore new-builds, costs incurred on major projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing, which resulted in a $297 million sequential decline in customer financing. 
For the quarter, the company generated $736 million in cash flow from operations. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $231 million, up almost 38% sequentially due to better-than-expected progress on several significant ongoing construction projects. In the quarter, we also invested $110 million in 3 acquisitions. We made dividend payments of $196 million and we spent $779 million to repurchase shares. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, down $555 million sequentially, but up $100 million from the prior year. And we ended the year in a net cash position of $370 million as we were able to make the previously mentioned investments without assuming any incremental debt. Of the $3.5 billion in cash, almost 16% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31, 2014. 
As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in our 10-year strategies, however, we will do so at a more measured pace than previously envisaged. As a result, we will expect to reduce year-to-year capital spending by 15%. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

We absolutely are continuing to look for larger transactions.

What we generally find is in a declining market, it's hard to get the bid and ask to converge. And most of those transactions are better accomplished and you get more agreement between the counterparties as markets are increasing. So I think until we begin to start to see a little bit of a recovery and a little bit stronger outlook, it's going to be hard to bid bids and ask to come together. But we're -- as you know, we're always out there looking for opportunities to deploy capital into good return opportunities and recognize that those conversations are long-term investments.

Given the pace of orders, we think it's probably going to be closer to that $7 billion range in terms of revenue flow and out of backlog this year, based on what we see today. Now we could receive some orders here in the next few months that we can turn into revenue before the end of the year, but right now, it's looking pretty soft.

But -- and I would add to that, too, our own suppliers we're in discussions with about reducing the prices that they charge us.

And as I said in the opening remarks, our plan is to manage to the market realities kind of quarter-by-quarter. We have a great backlog which we'll earn off over the next several quarters. As we find ourselves, let's say, this time next year without a resumption in orders in the offshore world, we expect 2 things to happen: One is our installation and commissioning efforts around the rigs that are being built will continue strong through 2015 and will end at 2016. As that starts to wind down a little bit though, we'll have good opportunities to pivot and refocus the technical capabilities of that group and the infrastructure that supports that group towards SPSs, which we do see rising in spite of the market challenges. We see opportunities to pivot and refocus that group towards more onshore aftermarket support. I think there's a great potential out there for NOV to build on its franchise in the land side and provide better aftermarket support of those customers. Likewise, on manufacturing, we expect to pivot, kind of refocus in the aftermarket opportunity around that. And then secondly -- that will help a lot. But secondly, we're going to be sizing to what the market dictates. As I also mentioned in my opening comments, we're outsourcing more than half of our machining work and rig, for instance. And so we have a lot of sort of flexible or flex supply chain out there that supports our efforts that we can diminish. And then thirdly, we've got 2 other big segments that have different cyclical behaviors. And so a recovery in rig counts in 2016 would do a lot to very rapidly lift demand by Wellbore Technologies, for machining capabilities, for assembly, and likewise, Completion & Production Solutions is on a little different cyclical trajectory. So we have -- by having 3 different segments that sort of has different cyclical behaviors, it gives us an opportunity to refocus resources into places that may need them."

A lot of credit capacity and expectation that as business slows, we will have cash come out of working capital and off of our balance sheet, plus $14.3 billion backlog translates to a pretty significant margin embedded in that backlog, which will turn to cash over the next year or 2. So we kind of entered this downturn with a lot of resources. And I think what that means is we have the capability to really do all of the above. And so we had very intentionally stepped up our focus on M&A, mostly around the smaller company opportunities, because frankly, they're more doable in this kind of market downturn. I think it's challenging for a public company to enter into an agreement to sell itself if it's not distressed, when its stock price is way below its 52-week high. And so it makes it difficult to do a larger transaction in this kind of environment. That's not to say -- like I mentioned earlier to Jim, that's not to say that we're not continuing conversations, surveying the landscape out there. But in terms of how we prioritize, I think we can do all of the above and do so in a way that doesn't sacrifice future flexibility, and do so in a way that keeps some powder dry for those opportunities as they arise. So that's kind of the thought process that we're going through. Specifically, with regard to the share buyback, I mean this is the company we know best. We can buy-in shares with no purchase premium and we can size those transactions to whatever size we feel comfortable with, which is why at our Analyst Day, we sort of linked the application of capital in the share buyback program to the repatriation of cash from overseas."

The other kind of interesting observation around -- about our aftermarket business is that as our customers have become a lot more focused on their expenditures, they're probably going to be more open to repairing old drilling equipment rather than replacing it with new drilling equipment. So we think there will be lots of instances where rather than selling, for instance, a new set of draw works out of rig systems that will actually have our Rig Aftermarket business now fixing an older set of draw works and kind of getting it back up and running.

Actually, thankfully for us, it really hasn't created a big impact on our programs. If you remember back a few years ago when Petrobras settled this up, they set up a separate financing arm called Sete in Brazil that's actually the customer, and it went out and secured its equity partner investors and secured its bank financings and kind of -- and so it's sort of moving along separately without virtually -- there's virtually no capital support from Petrobras into those projects to construct the rigs. Where the support comes is in the contracts to operate those rigs once they're delivered. And that's still a couple of years out. But based upon Sete placing orders to construct these rigs with their partners, shipyards jumped in the fray and concluding a couple of new shipyards that were constructed for this program. And so those have been proceeding along relatively smoothly. That's not to say without some delays and some issues and some challenges that we fully expected, but by and large, those projects are moving ahead. We expect the first rig to be delivered I think Q3 or Q4 this year. And the first of 22 rigs that were signed up to deliver. And the specific challenges that, that group of projects and shipyards have faced have been more around cost overruns on the construction of the shipyards had led it -- that led to a few payment delays for us. We're working through that. And the good news here within the past few weeks, a couple of financing packages have been made available to Sete. I mentioned in my opening comments the Development Bank of Brazil. I think the Central Bank is involved, the Banco do Brazil. And then some of the Asian partners to some of the shipyards are also financing the completion of the construction of those yards. So net-net, we're in pretty decent shape. But I think important for NOV shareholders is that we are ahead. We received more payments than we had delivered equipment into these projects, and so very important to us that we maintain that position from a risk management. So we're in pretty good shape on this, Robin."

This morning, we announced that the company earned $1.39 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. Excluding transaction and asset impairment charges, earnings were a record $1.69 per fully diluted share, an increase of 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. EBITDA on this basis improved 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. For the full year 2014, GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $5.82.

Looking forward, we obviously faced some significant challenges in the markets that we serve, and we will be discussing these through the next hour. But first, I want to take a moment and reflect on the company's accomplishments in 2014 and say thanks to the world's best oilfield services team. 
NOV completed the spin out of our distribution services business to our shareholders as NOW Inc. in May which led us to reorganize our remaining business along 4 new reporting segments and promote several executives into new leadership positions. Our new segment architecture is around customer axis which opened up new strategic possibilities for us, so our leadership teams spent the summer developing long-term strategies for each business. We presented these at our first Investor Day in November where we also laid out ambitious 5-year goals. 2014 also saw us announce a large increase in our dividend, lifting our payout ratio to within the range of 30%, as well as the authorization of a $3 billion stock buyback. Given the pace of change here through 2014, it would have been easy to have been distracted. I think the pace of change here makes NOV's 2014 record results doubly impressive. We had several business units post record annual and record quarterly results in 2014. I would like to express my gratitude to every one of our 60,000 employees who continue to execute exceptionally well on behalf of our customers, despite all these changes, to deliver great financial results for our shareholders. Thank you. 
As we look forward though, we face a tough market. With oil prices down more than 50%, our customers are quickly cutting spending, and the downturn we face will be severe in 2015 and possibly beyond. Drilling activity is falling sharply and our visibility is limited. The industry finds itself in this downturn, we believe, because rapidly growing North American oil supply, coupled with slowing demand in the OECD, slowing demand growth in China and other emerging economies and a strong U.S. dollar, all contributed to a supply-demand imbalance for oil late last year. With regards to slow oil demand in Europe and emerging economies, significantly lower energy costs were a meaningful widespread economic stimulus. As economies in Europe and Asia eventually strengthen, low oil prices and rising economic activity will spur oil demand growth from these regions. 
Second, we do not believe that global excess production capacity is excessive by historical standards. We do not face the kind of structural global overhang the industry faced in 1986 when Saudi Arabian production had been curtailed down to about 4 million barrels of oil per day and spare global oil capacity exceeded 15% of demand. We believe that this downturn will be more like 2002 or 2009. In both prior instances, recovery came within about 2 years. 
Third, we believe the recent swing source of incremental global oil supply is coming from North American shales. The production type curve from these basins exhibit extraordinarily steep decline rates, which is well-documented across thousands of wells in multiple shale basins. New shale reservoirs exhibit perhaps the highest national decline rates from any major source of oil in the industry's modern history. We see North American shale drilling slowing dramatically and quickly. Soon the rate of new shale wells coming online will decline. And the 4 million barrels of oil per day from U.S. shales will then begin to decline and will decline steeply. We believe this could lead to modest oil price recovery as early as late 2015. However, we expect shale production to continue to grow through the first half of 2015 before it begins to fall as the remaining inventory of well bores is completed and brought online, which means the recovery, once it arrives, may be a slower grind higher despite the steep decline curve behavior of shale oil. 
So in summary, a significant oil demand component to the imbalance, driven by macroeconomic conditions; lower oil costs contributing to eventual economic recovery; a major source of supply from extraordinarily high decline curve reservoirs; and a sharp drilling reduction response from the oil industry are a pretty good set of ingredients with which to bake an oil price recovery scenario. Nevertheless, we acknowledge many factors to keep oil prices down for longer. Deteriorating global economic conditions, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar or the return to market of oil from certain sideline countries are a few that come to mind. However, given the speed at which we see drilling activity slowing, it is very difficult for us to imagine that we will not see a significant oil supply response relatively soon. We don't believe the world can sustainably grow its oil supply with prices below say 80 -- $75 a barrel. And with prices below $60, oil production will begin to contract. Since oil supply growth will eventually be required at some point in the future, it stands to reason that oil prices must eventually cycle back up above $75 over the long-run. 
Given our short term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach to 2015 will be to focus on what we can control. We plan to manage NOV to the market quarter-to-quarter in view of near-term orders and activity while we steadily reduce costs as utilization levels permit, while also continuing to advance the long-term strategic goals we outlined at our Investor Day. We will manage to the realities of the markets we serve, but we plan to emerge from this cyclical downturn a better company, achieving new higher levels of operational excellence. 
The record fourth quarter results that we just announced reflect very little of the impending downturn. In fact, many of our operations spent the fourth quarter working 3 shifts 24/7 to meet our delivery obligations. Through 2014, we shipped record levels of top drives, blowout preventers, fiberglass pipe, jacking systems and numerous other products. In January, we did begin to see the drop in activity affecting our operations in a more widespread way, most acutely in Wellbore Technologies, but really, all segments seeing some impact. In view of the challenges ahead, we are beginning to bring work in from our suppliers to keep our own facilities better loaded. So for instance, right now, 52% of our machining requirements within rig systems and aftermarket are outsourced. As work declines, we will be repositioning some of that work into our own facilities. We're examining opportunities to consolidate facilities where possible, and we are working with our suppliers to improve efficiencies and cost as our customers press us for cost savings for their supply chains. I have tremendous confidence in the NOV team's ability to manage through the downturn and reduce costs. 
Although we have new leadership and new positions throughout our new organization, I will stress that these figures are not new to NOV, nor are they new to the industry or to cyclical downturns. By my count, this will be the sixth cyclical downturn we have faced through our careers. Unfortunately, despite our cost reduction measures we will nevertheless expect to see steep decrementals through 2015, as pricing pressure and low absorption on lower volumes will pressure margins. 
Orders for all our products has slowed sharply: Offshore, land, drilling, completion and production. Customers are delaying purchases of both capital and consumables wherever possible, seeking to conserve cash in the face of market uncertainty. We soon expect to see our customers begin to cannibalize existing equipment for capital components. For instance, pull a top drive off an idled rig within their fleet rather than place a new order for a new one with NOV in order to keep another contracted rig in need of a top drive working. Our customers will raid the spares inventory from their idled rigs to support those that are contracted and contributing -- and continuing to work, rather than place a spares order with us. They will redirect drill pipe, bits, jars, shakers and other kit rather than place new orders with us. History teaches us to expect this behavior to continue for at least the next couple of quarters, meaning orders will continue to be slow and our book-to-bill and Rig Systems well below 1. 
However, this behavior is not sustainable over the long term. Drilling consumes rigs much like driving consumes your automobile. The rate of consumption of capital equipment and consumables is declining with drilling activity, but customer spending always seems to overreact through cyclical downturns by living off their inventory and postponing maintenance and upgrades wherever they can. That only works for so long. Maintenance and upgrades can be deferred but cannot be postponed indefinitely for drilling rigs, so demand will return. In the past, this behavior has fueled demand surges for the kit NOV provides. Our markets change quickly in both directions. 
Also, we see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their rigs to meet contractual requirements or simply differentiate their rigs in a race to offer the most efficient drilling rigs. There remains interest. It's only academic for the time being in what the next big thing is for drilling: Configurable drill floors, closed loop automated drilling systems, automated pipe tailing and stand transfer of vehicles for land rigs, retrievable subsea BOP pods, low-cost mid-water floater designs, concepts which NOV continues to advance in accordance with our 10-year goals. Offshore, we are seeing customers defer some of their SPS survey work, although our total volume of SPS work continues to rise. As we've described in the past, offshore rigs are required to undergo shipyard surveys and obtain OEM certificates of compliance and activity called a special periodic survey, or SPS, to maintain their class designations and be qualified to drill in most markets. In an $80 oil world, contractors will proceed with the SPS on an uncontracted rig to ensure it is qualified for any potential contract which may arise which would require a pressing spud day. In a $50-oil world, contractors are incrementally less willing to invest in the SPS for an uncontracted rig and be more willing to forgo the possibility of missing a quick spud day contract. As an aside, I'll note that when the recovery comes to the offshore drilling market, shipyard capacity to execute SPSs may become a very scarce resource. 
In a $50-oil world, contractors become much more circumspect about all investments in older rigs. We expect to see even more rig retirements, both land and offshore, both announced and unannounced, in addition to those that we've seen already. This phenomenon has been witnessed in every category of drilling rigs passing through periodic cyclical downturns and incrementally contributes to better supply-demand balance for the fleets. 
Rig Systems posted new orders of $470 million, or a book-to-bill of just 21%, reflecting the customer mindset I just discussed. This resulted in a Rig Systems backlog of $12.5 billion to start 2015. This is a high backlog for NOV by historical standards, 16% higher than we carried into the 2009 downturn, for instance. We expect it to partly, but not fully, mitigate the effect of lower orders through 2015 on our day-to-day operations in rig systems. We foresee revenue out of backlog remaining strong through the first quarter of 2015 north of $2 billion, but beginning to decline modestly in the second quarter, more steeply in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. While 2015 orders will be slow, we do continue to see modest demand for certain markets like 20,000-psi deepwater, Middle Eastern land markets, Mexico and Argentina. 
Orders for Completion & Production Solutions did better through the fourth quarter, posting a book-to-bill of 60% on $469 million in orders, which resulted in a backlog of $1.8 billion to start 2015. On the production side, we continue to advance discussions around some large FPSO projects in spite of the low oil prices. In fact, the downturn and the troubled offshore project execution performance by the majors and NOCs has opened the door to new ideas amongst our large E&P customers. There's growing interest around doing things differently in deepwater developments to drive lower costs. We're accepting lots of invitations from majors to discuss our modular approach to vessel construction, to bring modern supply chain management techniques to bear to produce better results. Necessity is the mother of invention, and this market is wide open to new approaches. Our new approach is to offer a timely integrated package of NOV kit to minimize the interface conflicts brought about by the fragmented supply chain approach currently used to build these vessels. We seek to recycle designs and avoid reinventing the wheel for each new vessel which inevitably leads to unplanned manufacturing costs and delays. 
NOV has a tremendous track record of success in bringing this modular package approach to the construction of offshore drilling rigs through the last decade. Our extensive experience in working closely with shipyards to execute, install and commission these complex construction projects uniquely positions NOV to help the industry pioneer a better way. Although a large integrated package FPSO order for NOV is still a ways away, we've made great progress in securing customer buy-in through our new approach on 2 specific FPSO projects, which we ultimately expect to turn into form orders perhaps as early as late 2015. 
For both the Rig Systems and Completion & Production Solutions segments, we are glad to be able to carry strong backlogs into this downturn. Except for minor exceptions, the firm contracts governing our backlog projects do not permit cancellation for convenience. 
In 2009, we saw about 4% of our backlog evaporate, not really from cancellations, but rather from customer payment defaults. We expect a vast majority of our current backlog to be executed in accordance with the agreed terms like we experienced 6 years ago. In certain instances, we are considering customer requests for delivery delays, which can help us better manage costs in our currently stretched supply chain. But generally, we expect the continued on-time execution of our backlog to continue. Our 2009 stress test provides good empirical evidence for this outlook. 
Our 22 Brazil Atlas project floating rigs constitute about $3.5 billion of our backlog. We are ahead on progress payments on each of these projects, meaning we have collected more than we have invested in the inventory delivered on these as planned as we continue to fabricate components. We will begin installation and commissioning operations soon and are commencing riser manufacturing in Brazil currently. 
Generally, progress has been steady, but a little slower than originally planned which has not surprised us. While we have had some payment delays with some of our Brazilian shipyard customers who are building out their new shipyard facilities, we are confident in the successful completion of these rigs due to the financing package provided to Sete, the shipyards customers, by the Brazilian Development Bank and a consortium of banks a few weeks ago to fund the next 18 months of construction. Additionally, the shipyards have Asian partners who are, in some instances, providing additional capital to complete the construction of their facilities. The country of Brazil is all in on this and the rigs will be completed successfully. 
Like I said earlier, NOV will emerge from this downturn a stronger and better company. We are continuing to advance new technologies like closed-loop automated drilling, which has significantly improved drilling performance through several pilot programs. Other innovations like our Waterwolf oil recovery system for produced waters, thermal cuttings and absorption technologies, TUNDRA MAX mud coolers, automated pipe handling equipment for land rigs and retrievable pods for subsea BOPs will continue to make the oilfield safer and more productive. 
We have a strong balance sheet to help weather this downturn. We are seeking to invest opportunistically through this downturn. We continue to pursue our singles and doubles acquisition strategy, which improves our capabilities and global reach in our technology portfolio. We have 7 letters of intent in place and probably triple that in potential prospects. We also began investing in a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. To date, we have repurchased over 11.6 million shares of NOV for $779 million, which is a 2.7% reduction in our share count. Thus far, we have been able to accomplish this using cash on our balance sheet, which we have been able to repatriate from overseas locations. The $2.2 billion remaining on our current authorization, we plan to continue to repurchase NOV shares through the downturn, including, if necessary, using modest levels of debt from time to time to bridge to the next opportunity to repatriate cash from overseas.
Importantly, we acknowledged at our recent Investor Day that this is a cyclical business, and once or twice every decade, oil, as a commodity, tests its microeconomic variable cash cost floor of the marginal barrel. In setting our long-term strategies, we intentionally look through the cyclical downturn to entrepreneurially focus on actionable opportunities that we see ahead. My sixth cyclical downturn has not dissuaded me from the basic pieces we outlined in November, in line with ExxonMobil's outlook 2040 study, that the world's population will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion by the year 2040, economic growth will continue, standards of living will rise, oil and gas production will grow from a combination of shales and deepwater to fuel the world's appetite for energy and a better life. Specifically, the Exxon study calls for 25% growth in oil and 65% growth in gas through the next 25 years. In the near term, the E&P industry will sharpen its focus on improving economic efficiency and marginal cost of production of oil from all sources of oil as it has always done. And as the leading provider of innovation and technology and industrial capability to this critical entrepreneurial industry, National Oilwell Varco will play a key role in making that happen, and emerge better-positioned for the inevitable upturn. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy to take you through our fourth quarter and outlook. Jeremy?"

Since Clay already covered the consolidated results, I'll just dive straight into our segment operating performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and then attempt to provide a little color on the outlook for 2015. 
The Rig Systems segment generated quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% from a record third quarter as revenue out of backlog on offshore projects was not quite as strong sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 7% due to heightened demand for high-spec land rigs and equipment and our recent capacity additions, which have enabled us to convert more revenue out of backlog over the prior year. Operating profit for the segment was $511 million and operating margins were 20%, which were flat with the previous quarter despite the 4% sequential decline in revenue and up 90 basis points from the prior year.  
Fourth quarter EBITDA for the segment was $534 million or 20.9% of sales. For the full year 2014, Rig Systems posted record revenues of $9.8 billion, up 16.5% over 2013; and produced operating profit of almost $2 billion, or 20.3% of sales, which resulted in year-over-year flow through or leverage of 27%. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the fourth quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized $2.3 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured $470 million in new orders, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $12.5 billion. In the quarter, we secured 3 each drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, 5 each land rigs and a smattering of offshore land components. Of the total $12.5 billion in quarter-ending backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 91% is destined for international markets. 
The Rig Aftermarket segment posted record revenues of $850 million in the fourth quarter 2014, up 2% sequentially and up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013. As our large and growing installed base of equipment, combined with the investments that we have made in additional personnel, training, global infrastructure and inventory, have resulted in solid growth, operating profit for the segment was $245 million or 28.8% of revenue. That's up 140 basis points sequentially and up 300 basis points from the prior year on more favorable mix, with a higher percentage of high-margin service work and an unseasonably lower percentage of lower margin repair work. For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $252 million or 29.6% of revenue.  
For the full year 2014, Rig Aftermarket posted record revenues of $3.2 billion or 19.7% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $882 million or 27.4% of sales, which represented 29% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment posted record revenues of $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 11.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In the quarter, several businesses, including our drilling intervention, formerly downhole; our Grant Prideco drill pipe; our IntelliServ wired pipe; and our wellside services business delivered record or near-record results for customer revenue, which explains both the sequential and year-over-year increases. 
Operating profit for the segment was $276 million, or 18.1% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially, but up 20 basis points over the prior year. The slight sequential decline in margin was expected as the holidays invariably lead to under-absorption in our manufacturing and service facilities. For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $387 million or 25.3% of sales. 
For the full year 2014, Wellbore Technologies posted record revenues of $5.7 billion, up 12% over 2013; and produced operating profit of $1 billion, or 18.3% of sales, which represented 31% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven by strong deliveries of intervention stimulation equipment, which were up 24%, and floating production equipment which is up 29%, as well as solid sales of fiberglass systems and subsea production equipment. On a year-over-year basis, most businesses within this segment delivered low to mid-teens percentage growth, with the exception of our intervention and stimulation equipment business, which posted a 40% gain over the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Operating profit for the segment was $215 million, or 16.2% of revenues, which was up 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 and up 30 basis points from the third quarter of -- from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter EBITDA for this segment was $273 million or 20.6% of sales. For the full year 2014, the Completion & Production Solutions segment posted record revenues of $4.6 billion, up 7.8% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $700 million or 15.1% of sales. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment. During the quarter, the segment secured $469 million in new orders, which were more than offset by record shipments of $776 million out of backlog, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $1.8 billion. Sequentially, orders for production-related equipment increased slightly. However, this increase was more than offset by a 45% reduction in orders for intervention and stimulation equipment into the North American land market. Overall, it was another solid quarter that marked the end of a transformative and record-breaking year for NOV. So like Clay, I would like to thank each and every member of the NOV family for their commitment, their focus and hard work in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. 
As we move into 2015, it's clear that the sharp decline in oil prices will negatively impact our business. While we have some visibility into the first quarter of 2015, our forecast for the balance of the year seems to be changing by the day. For the first quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenues could decline in the high single-digit percentage range and that margins could erode on lower volumes. A higher percentage of Brazil-related revenue and additional expenses associated with customer-requested scheduling changes, with some customers requesting that we slightly delay projects, and others actually asking us to expedite deliveries. And from an order perspective, we believe that the pace and composition of orders could look somewhat similar to the pace and composition of orders that we received in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, continued market uncertainty could lead to indefinite delays on some of these expected orders which could result in even lower booking sequentially. 
For our Rig Aftermarket business as we move into the first quarter of 2015, we believe that revenues could actually decline slightly for 2 reasons: Number one, our customers clearly started scaling back in the fourth quarter, as evidenced by the noticeable reduction in bookings for spare parts and fluid and expendables; and two, we are facing significant and rising pricing pressure from our customers, which could lead and probably will lead to some pricing concessions and negatively impact our top line and our margins. 
For our Wellbore Technologies segment, it's important to remember that this segment is driven by drilling activity. More rigs drilling more wells and more footage creates more opportunity for the various businesses within Wellbore Technologies. Unfortunately, given the precipitous declines in oil prices and the active rig count, our customers are dramatically cutting spending while simultaneously demanding significant discounts. As such, for the first quarter, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could decline in the mid-teens percentage range, with decrementals in the 50% to 60% range. 
And finally, for our Completion & Production Solutions segment, we believe that first quarter 2015 revenues could decline by as much as 25%, with decrementals in the mid-30% range as we expect sharp declines in our higher margin intervention and stimulation equipment business as orders for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment and consumables have virtually disappeared. 
Predicting the full year 2015 is impossible in this environment. Still, I will make a few comments about each segment that I hope are helpful. 
At our Analyst Day in November, when oil was $75 a barrel, we included a chart that essentially forecasted a 10% year-over-year revenue decline in our Rig Systems segment. And in the Q&A section, we specifically stated that despite this 10% decline in revenue, Rig Systems margins could hold fairly steady at that 20% range. Unfortunately after watching oil prices plummet below $50 a barrel, our underlying assumptions have changed. In November, we expected about $7 billion to $7.5 billion of our third quarter-ending backlog to flow out as revenue in 2015, and we expect the demand for land rigs and for discrete components for both land and offshore to remain strong in the fourth quarter 2014 and well into 2015. But as evidenced by the $470 million in fourth quarter 2015 bookings and the recent announcements from our land and offshore drilling customers, the previously expected book in turn revenue in 2015 is now clearly in question. Additionally, as you might expect, we've received requests from some customers to delay specific projects and shipments on select projects which could ultimately push some revenue out of 2015 and into 2016. And since we may not receive the higher-margin book in turn orders that we expected and since we may have to juggle manufacturing, delivery and installation and commissioning schedules, all of which could add cost, we believe that margins could tick down slightly on the additional revenue reduction. 
For our Rig Aftermarket segment, we do not really know what to expect on the top line. However, we know that rig counts are falling and that customers are uncertain about their future prospects. And when customers are uncertain about their future prospects, they often curtail spending, consume existing inventories, cannibalize underutilized assets and indefinitely postpone upgrades. So when you couple that customer behavior with pricing concessions, we do not expect to see the same mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth that we have come to enjoy in previous years, and we believe that margins could erode slightly from 2014 levels. 
Because it's based on drilling activity and because we do not know how quickly or how far the rig count will ultimately fall, forecasting the full year for Wellbore Technologies segment is equally challenging. If one wanted to use the 2008 to 2009 timeframe as a proxy for 2014 to 2015, one could predict revenues to fall between 20% and 25%, with steep 50% to 60% decremental margins. As a point of reference, Wellbore Technologies segment revenues for the full year 2009, excluding non-recurring items, were 9.8%. Obviously, if faced with a top line decline similar to 2008 to 2009, we will make every effort to maximize profitability and improve upon the margins that we posted in 2009. However, it's important to remember that this segment is already facing substantial pricing pressure and it carries a heavy D&A load, including manufacturing and service facility infrastructure, sizable rental fleets and intangibles associated with prior acquisitions that work together to challenge profitability in a severe downturn.  
And finally, our Completion & Production Solutions segment is perhaps the most difficult to forecast due to the fact that it supplies both long lead time capital equipment and short cycle consumables to support a very volatile completions market and a sometimes frustratingly-slow-to-materialize offshore production market. As we move throughout 2015, we believe that demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing units will most likely be very soft in the U.S., with pockets of opportunity internationally. And we think that demand for floating and subsea production equipment will continue to be lumpy. But since we are entering the year with a reasonably healthy backlog, we would expect revenues to slightly outperform the decline in the overall market. And depending on the suddenness and magnitude of that top line decline, we believe that decremental leverage for this segment could be between 40% and 50%. 
So 2015 could certainly prove to be challenging. But as Clay stated and as we've clearly demonstrated in the past, we remain confident in the ability of this organization to adapt, and not just survive, but thrive in a cyclical downturn. 
So with that, let's turn to some of the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter 2014 income statement. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially but increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.1%. For the full year 2014, gross margin also improved 60 basis points to 27.1%. SG&A decreased $7 million sequentially but increased $46 million year-over-year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A declined 40 basis points sequentially and increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 9.2%. 
For the full year 2014, SG&A increased $214 million or 11.7%, but as a percentage of sales, SG&A actually declined slightly to 9.5%. Other items, which includes the impairment of some indefinite lives trade names within our Wellbore Technologies segment, as well as the loss associated with the sale of a non-core industrial business that was acquired in the Robbins & Myers transaction, were $163 million in the quarter. For the year, other items were $214 million versus $53 million in 2013. 
Interest expense was flat sequentially at $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. As compared to 2013, interest expense decreased $6 million and interest income increased $6 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV increased $7 million sequentially to $16 million, as the plant was once again fully operational following its annual maintenance in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, equity income was flat; and compared to the full year 2013, equity income declined $5 million to $58 million. For the first quarter and full year 2015, we believe that equity income will fall as demand for drill pipe and, therefore, green tube will moderate. 
Other expense for the quarter was $20 million, which represents a $29 million delta sequentially but is more consistent with historical trends. For the full year, other expense was $32 million versus $30 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1% which was 70 basis points lower than the 28.8% rate that we posted in the third quarter of 2014, and 200 to 300 basis points lower than historical trends and our expectations. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been closer to 30%. Therefore, as we move into 2015, we believe that 30% to 31% continues to be a realistic estimate of NOV's effective tax rate. 
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you'll see that eliminations were $556 million for the quarter, down slightly from $569 million in the third quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $229 million for the quarter, down $6 million sequentially on a lower volume of intersegment revenues. As compared to the full year 2013, eliminations increased 38.6% on higher volumes and unallocated expenses and eliminations increased 31.7%. 
And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you will see that depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $199 million, up $1 million from the third quarter and up $4 million from the previous year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization expense was $778 million, up 5.4% from 2013. EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. For the full year 2014, EBITDA was a record $4.6 billion, up 13.9% from 2013. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.4 billion, down $125 million or 2.3% sequentially. Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable decreased $66 million or 1.5% sequentially despite the $122 million sequential increase in revenue. Inventory declined $183 million or 3.3% sequentially as reductions in Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions were partially offset by inventory growth in Rig Aftermarket. 
Also leading to a sequential reduction in working capital, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $138 million. Unfortunately, due to the sequential decline in bookings for offshore new-builds, costs incurred on major projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing, which resulted in a $297 million sequential decline in customer financing. 
For the quarter, the company generated $736 million in cash flow from operations. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $231 million, up almost 38% sequentially due to better-than-expected progress on several significant ongoing construction projects. In the quarter, we also invested $110 million in 3 acquisitions. We made dividend payments of $196 million and we spent $779 million to repurchase shares. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, down $555 million sequentially, but up $100 million from the prior year. And we ended the year in a net cash position of $370 million as we were able to make the previously mentioned investments without assuming any incremental debt. Of the $3.5 billion in cash, almost 16% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31, 2014. 
As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in our 10-year strategies, however, we will do so at a more measured pace than previously envisaged. As a result, we will expect to reduce year-to-year capital spending by 15%. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

In the prepared remarks, I talked about at the end of Q3 and as we got to our Analyst Day, we actually thought that about $7 billion to $7.5 billion would flow out of our current backlog, and that was the backlog at the end of Q3. We then assumed that we'd get some book in turn in Q4 and throughout 2015, that would take that number up. Given the pace of orders, we think it's probably going to be closer to that $7 billion range in terms of revenue flow and out of backlog this year, based on what we see today. Now we could receive some orders here in the next few months that we can turn into revenue before the end of the year, but right now, it's looking pretty soft. So I think somewhere in that $7 billion range is probably reasonable."

I think there is some benefit, actually, as volumes start to back off just a little bit, in terms of reducing some overtime, of reverting to our most productive shifts, reverting to our most productive sub suppliers, and so that will help on the margin front. But -- and I would add to that, too, our own suppliers we're in discussions with about reducing the prices that they charge us. We're hesitant though to wrap margin improvement around that scenario because, no doubt, we're going to continue to see price pressure and face challenges that are coming out of the current slow market."

When you think about the decline in oil today, and people like to reference 2009. But as we stand today, deepwater rig rates are coming down much more quickly in general that the backlogs of the offshore drillers is much less than that time frame and there's a probably a legitimate discussion that offshore rig rates could go close to cash breakeven. How do you think about Rig Systems and orders over the next 2 to 3 years if that happens? And how do you think shipyards will react, I mean,  price standpoint? Last time, they reduced price, which helped. But will it really help if rig rates are at such a depressed level that they didn't even bother to reduce price because no one's going to order anyway?"

And as I said in the opening remarks, our plan is to manage to the market realities kind of quarter-by-quarter. We have a great backlog which we'll burn off over the next several quarters. As we find ourselves, let's say, this time next year without a resumption in orders in the offshore world, we expect 2 things to happen: One is our installation and commissioning efforts around the rigs that are being built will continue strong through 2015 and will end at 2016. As that starts to wind down a little bit though, we'll have good opportunities to pivot and refocus the technical capabilities of that group and the infrastructure that supports that group towards SPSs, which we do see rising in spite of the market challenges. We see opportunities to pivot and refocus that group towards more onshore aftermarket support. I think there's a great potential out there for NOV to build on its franchise in the land side and provide better aftermarket support of those customers. Likewise, on manufacturing, we expect to pivot and kind of refocus in the aftermarket opportunity around that. And then secondly -- that will help a lot. But secondly, we're going to be sizing to what the market dictates. As I also mentioned in my opening comments, we're outsourcing more than half of our machining work and rig, for instance. And so we have a lot of sort of flexible or flex supply chain out there that supports our efforts that we can diminish. And then thirdly, we've got 2 other big segments that have different cyclical behaviors. And so a recovery in rig counts in 2016 would do a lot to very rapidly lift demand by Wellbore Technologies, for machining capabilities, for assembly, and likewise, Completion & Production Solutions is on a little different cyclical trajectory. So we have -- by having 3 different segments that sort of has different cyclical behaviors, it gives us an opportunity to refocus resources into places that may need them."

A lot of credit capacity and expectation that as business slows, we will have cash come out of working capital and off of our balance sheet, plus $14.3 billion backlog translates to a pretty significant margin embedded in that backlog, which will turn to cash over the next year or 2. So we kind of entered this downturn with a lot of resources. And I think what that means is we have the capability to really do all of the above. And so we have very intentionally stepped up our focus on M&A, mostly around the smaller company opportunities, because frankly, they're more doable in this kind of market downturn. I think it's challenging for a public company to enter into an agreement to sell itself if it's not distressed, when its stock price is way below its 52-week high. And so it makes it difficult to do a larger transaction in this kind of environment. That's not to say -- like I mentioned earlier to Jim, that's not to say that we're not continuing conversations and surveying the landscape out there. But in terms of how we prioritize, I think we can do all of the above and do so in a way that doesn't sacrifice future flexibility, and do so in a way that keeps some powder dry for those opportunities as they arise. So that's kind of the thought process that we're going through. Specifically, with regard to the share buyback, I mean this is the company we know best. We can buy-in shares with no purchase premium and we can size those transactions to whatever size we feel comfortable with, which is why at our Analyst Day, we sort of linked the application of capital in the share buyback program to the repatriation of cash from overseas."

The other kind of interesting observation around -- about our aftermarket business is that as our customers have become a lot more focused on their expenditures, they're probably going to be more open to repairing old drilling equipment rather than replacing it with new drilling equipment. So we think there will be lots of instances where rather than selling, for instance, a new set of draw works out of rig systems that will actually have our Rig Aftermarket business now fixing an older set of draw works and kind of getting it back up and running.

Actually, thankfully for us, it really hasn't created a big impact on our programs. If you remember back a few years ago when Petrobras set all this up, they set up a separate financing arm called Sete in Brazil that is actually the customer, and it went out and secured its equity partner investors and secured its bank financings and kind of -- and so it's sort of moving along separately without virtually -- there's virtually no capital support from Petrobras into those projects to construct the rigs. Where the support comes is in the contracts to operate those rigs once they're delivered. And that's still a couple of years out. But based upon Sete placing orders to construct these rigs with their partners, shipyards jumped in the fray and concluding a couple of new shipyards that were constructed for this program. And so those have been proceeding along relatively smoothly. That's not to say without some delays and some issues and some challenges that we fully expected, but by and large, those projects are moving ahead. We expect the first rig to be delivered I think Q3 or Q4 this year. And the first of 22 rigs that were signed up to deliver. And the specific challenges that, that group of projects and shipyards have faced have been more around cost overruns on the construction of the shipyards had led it -- that led to a few payment delays for us. We're working through that. And the good news here within the past few weeks, a couple of financing packages have been made available to Sete. I mentioned in my opening comments the Development Bank of Brazil. I think the Central Bank is involved, the Banco do Brazil. And then some of the Asian partners to some of the shipyards are also financing the completion of the construction of those yards. So net-net, we're in pretty decent shape. But I think important for NOV shareholders is that we are ahead. We received more payments than we had delivered equipment into these projects, and so very important to us that we maintain that position from a risk management. So we're in pretty good shape on this, Robin."

This morning, we announced that the company earned $1.39 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. Excluding transaction and asset impairment charges, earnings were a record $1.69 per fully diluted share, an increase of 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. EBITDA on this basis improved 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. For the full year 2014, GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $5.82. Excluding other items and impairment charges, earnings were a record $6.07 per fully diluted share, up 12% from the prior year. EBITDA for the year, excluding other items and impairment charges, was a record $4.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year on the same basis. 
Looking forward, we obviously faced some significant challenges in the markets that we serve, and we will be discussing these through the next hour. But first, I want to take a moment and reflect on the company's accomplishments in 2014 and say thanks to the world's best oilfield services team. 
NOV completed the spin out of our distribution services business to our shareholders as NOW Inc. in May which led us to reorganize our remaining business along 4 new reporting segments and promote several executives into new leadership positions. Our new segment architecture is around customer axis which opened up new strategic possibilities for us, so our leadership teams spent the summer developing long-term strategies for each business. We presented these at our first Investor Day in November where we also laid out ambitious 5-year goals. 2014 also saw us announce a large increase in our dividend, lifting our payout ratio to within the range of 30%, as well as the authorization of a $3 billion stock buyback. Given the pace of change here through 2014, it would have been easy to have been distracted. I think the pace of change here makes NOV's 2014 record results doubly impressive. We had several business units post record annual and record quarterly results in 2014. I would like to express my gratitude to every one of our 60,000 employees who continue to execute exceptionally well on behalf of our customers, despite all these changes, to deliver great financial results for our shareholders. Thank you. 
As we look forward though, we face a tough market. With oil prices down more than 50%, our customers are quickly cutting spending, and the downturn we face will be severe in 2015 and possibly beyond. Drilling activity is falling sharply and our visibility is limited. The industry finds itself in this downturn, we believe, because rapidly growing North American oil supply, coupled with slowing demand in the OECD, slowing demand growth in China and other emerging economies and a strong U.S. dollar, all contributed to a supply-demand imbalance for oil late last year. With regards to slow oil demand in Europe and emerging economies, significantly lower energy costs were a meaningful widespread economic stimulus. As economies in Europe and Asia eventually strengthen, low oil prices and rising economic activity will spur oil demand growth from these regions. 
Second, we do not believe that global excess production capacity is excessive by historical standards. We do not face the kind of structural global overhang the industry faced in 1986 when Saudi Arabian production had been curtailed down to about 4 million barrels of oil per day and spare global oil capacity exceeded 15% of demand. We believe that this downturn will be more like 2002 or 2009. In both prior instances, recovery came within about 2 years. 
Third, we believe the recent swing source of incremental global oil supply is coming from North American shales. The production type curve from these basins exhibit extraordinarily steep decline rates, which is well-documented across thousands of wells in multiple shale basins. New shale reservoirs exhibit perhaps the highest national decline rates from any major source of oil in the industry's modern history. We see North American shale drilling slowing dramatically and quickly. Soon the rate of new shale wells coming online will decline. And the 4 million barrels of oil per day from U.S. shales will then begin to decline and will decline steeply. We believe this could lead to modest oil price recovery as early as late 2015. However, we expect shale production to continue to grow through the first half of 2015 before it begins to fall as the remaining inventory of well bores is completed and brought online, which means the recovery, once it arrives, may be a slower grind higher despite the steep decline curve behavior of shale oil. 
So in summary, a significant oil demand component to the imbalance, driven by macroeconomic conditions; lower oil costs contributing to eventual economic recovery; a major source of supply from extraordinarily high decline curve reservoirs; and a sharp drilling reduction response from the oil industry are a pretty good set of ingredients with which to bake an oil price recovery scenario. Nevertheless, we acknowledge many factors to keep oil prices down for longer. Deteriorating global economic conditions, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar or the return to market of oil from certain sideline countries are a few that come to mind. However, given the speed at which we see drilling activity slowing, it is very difficult for us to imagine that we will not see a significant oil supply response relatively soon. We don't believe the world can sustainably grow its oil supply with prices below say 80 -- $75 a barrel. And with prices below $60, oil production will begin to contract. Since oil supply growth will eventually be required at some point in the future, it stands to reason that oil prices must eventually cycle back up above $75 over the long-run. 
Given our short term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach to 2015 will be to focus on what we can control. We plan to manage NOV to the market quarter-to-quarter in view of near-term orders and activity while we steadily reduce costs as utilization levels permit, while also continuing to advance the long-term strategic goals we outlined at our Investor Day. We will manage to the realities of the markets we serve, but we plan to emerge from this cyclical downturn a better company, achieving new higher levels of operational excellence. 
The record fourth quarter results that we just announced reflect very little of the impending downturn. In fact, many of our operations spent the fourth quarter working 3 shifts 24/7 to meet our delivery obligations. Through 2014, we shipped record levels of top drives, blowout preventers, fiberglass pipe, jacking systems and numerous other products. In January, we did begin to see the drop in activity affecting our operations in a more widespread way, most acutely in Wellbore Technologies, but really, all segments seeing some impact. In view of the challenges ahead, we are beginning to bring work in from our suppliers to keep our own facilities better loaded. So for instance, right now, 52% of our machining requirements within rig systems and aftermarket are outsourced. As work declines, we will be repositioning some of that work into our own facilities. We're examining opportunities to consolidate facilities where possible, and we are working with our suppliers to improve efficiencies and cost as our customers press us for cost savings for their supply chains. I have tremendous confidence in the NOV team's ability to manage through the downturn and reduce costs. 
Although we have new leadership and new positions throughout our new organization, I will stress that these figures are not new to NOV, nor are they new to the industry or to cyclical downturns. By my count, this will be the sixth cyclical downturn we have faced through our careers. Unfortunately, despite our cost reduction measures we will nevertheless expect to see steep decrementals through 2015, as pricing pressure and low absorption on lower volumes will pressure margins. 
Orders for all our products has slowed sharply: Offshore, land, drilling, completion and production. Customers are delaying purchases of both capital and consumables wherever possible, seeking to conserve cash in the face of market uncertainty. We soon expect to see our customers begin to cannibalize existing equipment for capital components. For instance, pull a top drive off an idled rig within their fleet rather than place a new order for a new one with NOV in order to keep another contracted rig in need of a top drive working. Our customers will raid the spares inventory from their idled rigs to support those that are contracted and contributing -- and continuing to work, rather than place a spares order with us. They will redirect drill pipe, bits, jars, shakers and other kit rather than place new orders with us. History teaches us to expect this behavior to continue for at least the next couple of quarters, meaning orders will continue to be slow and our book-to-bill and Rig Systems well below 1. 
However, this behavior is not sustainable over the long term. Drilling consumes rigs much like driving consumes your automobile. The rate of consumption of capital equipment and consumables is declining with drilling activity, but customer spending always seems to overreact through cyclical downturns by living off their inventory and postponing maintenance and upgrades wherever they can. That only works for so long. Maintenance and upgrades can be deferred but cannot be postponed indefinitely for drilling rigs, so demand will return. In the past, this behavior has fueled demand surges for the kit NOV provides. Our markets change quickly in both directions. 
Also, we see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their rigs to meet contractual requirements or simply differentiate their rigs in a race to offer the most efficient drilling rigs. There remains interest. It's only academic for the time being in what the next big thing is for drilling: Configurable drill floors, closed loop automated drilling systems, automated pipe tailing and stand transfer of vehicles for land rigs, retrievable subsea BOP pods, low-cost mid-water floater designs, concepts which NOV continues to advance in accordance with our 10-year goals. Offshore, we are seeing customers defer some of their SPS survey work, although our total volume of SPS work continues to rise. As we've described in the past, offshore rigs are required to undergo shipyard surveys and obtain OEM certificates of compliance and activity called a special periodic survey, or SPS, to maintain their class designations and be qualified to drill in most markets. In an $80 oil world, contractors will proceed with the SPS on an uncontracted rig to ensure it is qualified for any potential contract which may arise which would require a pressing spud day. In a $50-oil world, contractors are incrementally less willing to invest in the SPS for an uncontracted rig and be more willing to forgo the possibility of missing a quick spud day contract. As an aside, I'll note that when the recovery comes to the offshore drilling market, shipyard capacity to execute SPSs may become a very scarce resource. 
In a $50-oil world, contractors become much more circumspect about all investments in older rigs. We expect to see even more rig retirements, both land and offshore, both announced and unannounced, in addition to those that we've seen already. This phenomenon has been witnessed in every category of drilling rigs passing through periodic cyclical downturns and incrementally contributes to better supply-demand balance for the fleets. 
Rig Systems posted new orders of $470 million, or a book-to-bill of just 21%, reflecting the customer mindset I just discussed. This resulted in a Rig Systems backlog of $12.5 billion to start 2015. This is a high backlog for NOV by historical standards, 16% higher than we carried into the 2009 downturn, for instance. We expect it to partly, but not fully, mitigate the effect of lower orders through 2015 on our day-to-day operations in rig systems. We foresee revenue out of backlog remaining strong through the first quarter of 2015 north of $2 billion, but beginning to decline modestly in the second quarter, more steeply in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. While 2015 orders will be slow, we do continue to see modest demand for certain markets like 20,000-psi deepwater, Middle Eastern land markets, Mexico and Argentina. 
Orders for Completion & Production Solutions did better through the fourth quarter, posting a book-to-bill of 60% on $469 million in orders, which resulted in a backlog of $1.8 billion to start 2015. On the production side, we continue to advance discussions around some large FPSO projects in spite of the low oil prices. In fact, the downturn and the troubled offshore project execution performance by the majors and NOCs has opened the door to new ideas amongst our large E&P customers. There's growing interest around doing things differently in deepwater developments to drive lower costs. We're accepting lots of invitations from majors to discuss our modular approach to vessel construction, to bring modern supply chain management techniques to bear to produce better results. Necessity is the mother of invention, and this market is wide open to new approaches. Our new approach is to offer a timely integrated package of NOV kit to minimize the interface conflicts brought about by the fragmented supply chain approach currently used to build these vessels. We seek to recycle designs and avoid reinventing the wheel for each new vessel which inevitably leads to unplanned manufacturing costs and delays. 
NOV has a tremendous track record of success in bringing this modular package approach to the construction of offshore drilling rigs through the last decade. Our extensive experience in working closely with shipyards to execute, install and commission these complex construction projects uniquely positions NOV to help the industry pioneer a better way. Although a large integrated package FPSO order for NOV is still a ways away, we've made great progress in securing customer buy-in through our new approach on 2 specific FPSO projects, which we ultimately expect to turn into form orders perhaps as early as late 2015. 
For both the Rig Systems and Completion & Production Solutions segments, we are glad to be able to carry strong backlogs into this downturn. Except for minor exceptions, the firm contracts governing our backlog projects do not permit cancellation for convenience. 
In 2009, we saw about 4% of our backlog evaporate, not really from cancellations, but rather from customer payment defaults. We expect a vast majority of our current backlog to be executed in accordance with the agreed terms like we experienced 6 years ago. In certain instances, we are considering customer requests for delivery delays, which can help us better manage costs in our currently stretched supply chain. But generally, we expect the continued on-time execution of our backlog to continue. Our 2009 stress test provides good empirical evidence for this outlook. 
Our 22 Brazil Atlas project floating rigs constitute about $3.5 billion of our backlog. We are ahead on progress payments on each of these projects, meaning we have collected more than we have invested in the inventory delivered on these as planned as we continue to fabricate components. We will begin installation and commissioning operations soon and are commencing riser manufacturing in Brazil currently. 
Generally, progress has been steady, but a little slower than originally planned which has not surprised us. While we have had some payment delays with some of our Brazilian shipyard customers who are building out their new shipyard facilities, we are confident in the successful completion of these rigs due to the financing package provided to Sete, the shipyards customers, by the Brazilian Development Bank and a consortium of banks a few weeks ago to fund the next 18 months of construction. Additionally, the shipyards have Asian partners who are, in some instances, providing additional capital to complete the construction of their facilities. The country of Brazil is all in on this and the rigs will be completed successfully. 
Like I said earlier, NOV will emerge from this downturn a stronger and better company. We are continuing to advance new technologies like closed-loop automated drilling, which has significantly improved drilling performance through several pilot programs. Other innovations like our Waterwolf oil recovery system for produced waters, thermal cuttings and absorption technologies, TUNDRA MAX mud coolers, automated pipe handling equipment for land rigs and retrievable pods for subsea BOPs will continue to make the oilfield safer and more productive. 
We have a strong balance sheet to help weather this downturn. We are seeking to invest opportunistically through this downturn. We continue to pursue our singles and doubles acquisition strategy, which improves our capabilities and global reach in our technology portfolio. We have 7 letters of intent in place and probably triple that in potential prospects. We also began investing in a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. To date, we have repurchased over 11.6 million shares of NOV for $779 million, which is a 2.7% reduction in our share count. Thus far, we have been able to accomplish this using cash on our balance sheet, which we have been able to repatriate from overseas locations. The $2.2 billion remaining on our current authorization, we plan to continue to repurchase NOV shares through the downturn, including, if necessary, using modest levels of debt from time to time to bridge to the next opportunity to repatriate cash from overseas.
Importantly, we acknowledged at our recent Investor Day that this is a cyclical business, and once or twice every decade, oil, as a commodity, tests its microeconomic variable cash cost floor of the marginal barrel. In setting our long-term strategies, we intentionally look through the cyclical downturn to entrepreneurially focus on actionable opportunities that we see ahead. My sixth cyclical downturn has not dissuaded me from the basic pieces we outlined in November, in line with ExxonMobil's outlook 2040 study, that the world's population will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion by the year 2040, economic growth will continue, standards of living will rise, oil and gas production will grow from a combination of shales and deepwater to fuel the world's appetite for energy and a better life. Specifically, the Exxon study calls for 25% growth in oil and 65% growth in gas through the next 25 years. In the near term, the E&P industry will sharpen its focus on improving economic efficiency and marginal cost of production of oil from all sources of oil as it has always done. And as the leading provider of innovation and technology and industrial capability to this critical entrepreneurial industry, National Oilwell Varco will play a key role in making that happen, and emerge better-positioned for the inevitable upturn. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy to take you through our fourth quarter and outlook. Jeremy?"

Since Clay already covered the consolidated results, I'll just dive straight into our segment operating performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and then attempt to provide a little color on the outlook for 2015. 
The Rig Systems segment generated quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% from a record third quarter as revenue out of backlog on offshore projects was not quite as strong sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 7% due to heightened demand for high-spec land rigs and equipment and our recent capacity additions, which have enabled us to convert more revenue out of backlog over the prior year. Operating profit for the segment was $511 million and operating margins were 20%, which were flat with the previous quarter despite the 4% sequential decline in revenue and up 90 basis points from the prior year. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA for the segment was $534 million or 20.9% of sales. For the full year 2014, Rig Systems posted record revenues of $9.8 billion, up 16.5% over 2013; and produced operating profit of almost $2 billion, or 20.3% of sales, which resulted in year-over-year flow through or leverage of 27%. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the fourth quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized $2.3 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured $470 million in new orders, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $12.5 billion. In the quarter, we secured 3 each drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, 5 each land rigs and a smattering of offshore land components. Of the total $12.5 billion in quarter-ending backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 91% is destined for international markets. 
The Rig Aftermarket segment posted record revenues of $850 million in the fourth quarter 2014, up 2% sequentially and up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013. As our large and growing installed base of equipment, combined with the investments that we have made in additional personnel, training, global infrastructure and inventory, have resulted in solid growth, operating profit for the segment was $245 million or 28.8% of revenue. That's up 140 basis points sequentially and up 300 basis points from the prior year on more favorable mix, with a higher percentage of high-margin service work and an unseasonably lower percentage of lower margin repair work. For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $252 million or 29.6% of revenue. 
For the full year 2014, Rig Aftermarket posted record revenues of $3.2 billion or 19.7% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $882 million or 27.4% of sales, which represented 29% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment posted record revenues of $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 11.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In the quarter, several businesses, including our drilling intervention, formerly downhole; our Grant Prideco drill pipe; our IntelliServ wired pipe; and our wellside services business delivered record or near-record results for customer revenue, which explains both the sequential and year-over-year increases. 
Operating profit for the segment was $276 million or 18.1% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially, but up 20 basis points over the prior year. The slight sequential decline in margin was expected as the holidays invariably lead to under-absorption in our manufacturing and service facilities. For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $387 million or 25.3% of sales. 
For the full year 2014, Wellbore Technologies posted record revenues of $5.7 billion, up 12% over 2013; and produced operating profit of $1 billion, or 18.3% of sales, which represented 31% leverage on the incremental revenue. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven by strong deliveries of intervention stimulation equipment, which were up 24%, and floating production equipment which is up 29%, as well as solid sales of fiberglass systems and subsea production equipment. On a year-over-year basis, most businesses within this segment delivered low to mid-teens percentage growth, with the exception of our intervention and stimulation equipment business, which posted a 40% gain over the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Operating profit for the segment was $215 million, or 16.2% of revenues, which was up 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 and up 30 basis points from the third quarter of -- from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter EBITDA for this segment was $273 million or 20.6% of sales. For the full year 2014, the Completion & Production Solutions segment posted record revenues of $4.6 billion, up 7.8% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $700 million or 15.1% of sales. 
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment. During the quarter, the segment secured $469 million in new orders, which were more than offset by record shipments of $776 million out of backlog, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $1.8 billion. Sequentially, orders for production-related equipment increased slightly. However, this increase was more than offset by a 45% reduction in orders for intervention and stimulation equipment into the North American land market. Overall, it was another solid quarter that marked the end of a transformative and record-breaking year for NOV. So like Clay, I would like to thank each and every member of the NOV family for their commitment, their focus and hard work in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. 
As we move into 2015, it's clear that the sharp decline in oil prices will negatively impact our business. While we have some visibility into the first quarter of 2015, our forecast for the balance of the year seems to be changing by the day. For the first quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenues could decline in the high single-digit percentage range and that margins could erode on lower volumes. A higher percentage of Brazil-related revenue and additional expenses associated with customer-requested scheduling changes, with some customers requesting that we slightly delay projects, and others actually asking us to expedite deliveries. And from an order perspective, we believe that the pace and composition of orders could look somewhat similar to the pace and composition of orders that we received in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, continued market uncertainty could lead to indefinite delays on some of these expected orders which could result in even lower booking sequentially. 
For our Rig Aftermarket business as we move into the first quarter of 2015, we believe that revenues could actually decline slightly for 2 reasons: Number one, our customers clearly started scaling back in the fourth quarter, as evidenced by the noticeable reduction in bookings for spare parts and fluid and expendables; and two, we are facing significant and rising pricing pressure from our customers, which could lead and probably will lead to some pricing concessions and negatively impact our top line and our margins. 
For our Wellbore Technologies segment, it's important to remember that this segment is driven by drilling activity. More rigs drilling more wells and more footage creates more opportunity for the various businesses within Wellbore Technologies. Unfortunately, given the precipitous declines in oil prices and the active rig count, our customers are dramatically cutting spending while simultaneously demanding significant discounts. As such, for the first quarter, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could decline in the mid-teens percentage range, with decrementals in the 50% to 60% range. 
And finally, for our Completion & Production Solutions segment, we believe that first quarter 2015 revenues could decline by as much as 25%, with decrementals in the mid-30% range as we expect sharp declines in our higher margin intervention and stimulation equipment business as orders for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment and consumables have virtually disappeared. 
Predicting the full year 2015 is impossible in this environment. Still, I will make a few comments about each segment that I hope are helpful. 
At our Analyst Day in November, when oil was $75 a barrel, we included a chart that essentially forecasted a 10% year-over-year revenue decline in our Rig Systems segment. And in the Q&A section, we specifically stated that despite this 10% decline in revenue, Rig Systems margins could hold fairly steady at that 20% range. Unfortunately after watching oil prices plummet below $50 a barrel, our underlying assumptions have changed. In November, we expected about $7 billion to $7.5 billion of our third quarter-ending backlog to flow out as revenue in 2015, and we expect the demand for land rigs and for discrete components for both land and offshore to remain strong in the fourth quarter 2014 and well into 2015. But as evidenced by the $470 million in fourth quarter 2015 bookings and the recent announcements from our land and offshore drilling customers, the previously expected book in turn revenue in 2015 is now clearly in question. Additionally, as you might expect, we've received requests from some customers to delay specific projects and shipments on select projects which could ultimately push some revenue out of 2015 and into 2016. And since we may not receive the higher-margin book in turn orders that we expected and since we may have to juggle manufacturing, delivery and installation and commissioning schedules, all of which could add cost, we believe that margins could tick down slightly on the additional revenue reduction. 
For our Rig Aftermarket segment, we do not really know what to expect on the top line. However, we know that rig counts are falling and that customers are uncertain about their future prospects. And when customers are uncertain about their future prospects, they often curtail spending, consume existing inventories, cannibalize underutilized assets and indefinitely postpone upgrades. So when you couple that customer behavior with pricing concessions, we do not expect to see the same mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth that we have come to enjoy in previous years, and we believe that margins could erode slightly from 2014 levels. 
Because it's based on drilling activity and because we do not know how quickly or how far the rig count will ultimately fall, forecasting the full year for Wellbore Technologies segment is equally challenging. If one wanted to use the 2008 to 2009 timeframe as a proxy for 2014 to 2015, one could predict revenues to fall between 20% and 25%, with steep 50% to 60% decremental margins. As a point of reference, Wellbore Technologies segment revenues for the full year 2009, excluding non-recurring items, were 9.8%. Obviously, if faced with a top line decline similar to 2008 to 2009, we will make every effort to maximize profitability and improve upon the margins that we posted in 2009. However, it's important to remember that this segment is already facing substantial pricing pressure and it carries a heavy D&A load, including manufacturing and service facility infrastructure, sizable rental fleets and intangibles associated with prior acquisitions that work together to challenge profitability in a severe downturn. 
And finally, our Completion & Production Solutions segment is perhaps the most difficult to forecast due to the fact that it supplies both long lead time capital equipment and short cycle consumables to support a very volatile completions market and a sometimes frustratingly-slow-to-materialize offshore production market. As we move throughout 2015, we believe that demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing units will most likely be very soft in the U.S., with pockets of opportunity internationally. And we think that demand for floating and subsea production equipment will continue to be lumpy. But since we are entering the year with a reasonably healthy backlog, we would expect revenues to slightly outperform the decline in the overall market. And depending on the suddenness and magnitude of that top line decline, we believe that decremental leverage for this segment could be between 40% and 50%. 
So 2015 could certainly prove to be challenging. But as Clay stated and as we've clearly demonstrated in the past, we remain confident in the ability of this organization to adapt, and not just survive, but thrive in a cyclical downturn. 
So with that, let's turn to some of the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter 2014 income statement. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially but increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.1%. For the full year 2014, gross margin also improved 60 basis points to 27.1%. SG&A decreased $7 million sequentially but increased $46 million year-over-year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A declined 40 basis points sequentially and increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 9.2%. 
For the full year 2014, SG&A increased $214 million or 11.7%, but as a percentage of sales, SG&A actually declined slightly to 9.5%. Other items, which includes the impairment of some indefinite lives trade names within our Wellbore Technologies segment, as well as the loss associated with the sale of a non-core industrial business that was acquired in the Robbins & Myers transaction, were $163 million in the quarter. For the year, other items were $214 million versus $53 million in 2013. 
Interest expense was flat sequentially at $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. As compared to 2013, interest expense decreased $6 million and interest income increased $6 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV increased $7 million sequentially to $16 million, as the plant was once again fully operational following its annual maintenance in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, equity income was flat; and compared to the full year 2013, equity income declined $5 million to $58 million. For the first quarter and full year 2015, we believe that equity income will fall as demand for drill pipe and, therefore, green tube will moderate. 
Other expense for the quarter was $20 million, which represents a $29 million delta sequentially but is more consistent with historical trends. For the full year, other expense was $32 million versus $30 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1% which was 70 basis points lower than the 28.8% rate that we posted in the third quarter of 2014, and 200 to 300 basis points lower than historical trends and our expectations. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been closer to 30%. Therefore, as we move into 2015, we believe that 30% to 31% continues to be a realistic estimate of NOV's effective tax rate. 
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you'll see that eliminations were $556 million for the quarter, down slightly from $569 million in the third quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $229 million for the quarter, down $6 million sequentially on a lower volume of intersegment revenues. As compared to the full year 2013, eliminations increased 38.6% on higher volumes and unallocated expenses and eliminations increased 31.7%. 
And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you will see that depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $199 million, up $1 million from the third quarter and up $4 million from the previous year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization expense was $778 million, up 5.4% from 2013. EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. For the full year 2014, EBITDA was a record $4.6 billion, up 13.9% from 2013. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.4 billion, down $125 million or 2.3% sequentially. Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable decreased $66 million or 1.5% sequentially despite the $122 million sequential increase in revenue. Inventory declined $183 million or 3.3% sequentially as reductions in Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions were partially offset by inventory growth in Rig Aftermarket. 
Also leading to a sequential reduction in working capital, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $138 million. Unfortunately, due to the sequential decline in bookings for offshore new-builds, costs incurred on major projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing, which resulted in a $297 million sequential decline in customer financing. 
For the quarter, the company generated $736 million in cash flow from operations. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $231 million, up almost 38% sequentially due to better-than-expected progress on several significant ongoing construction projects. In the quarter, we also invested $110 million in 3 acquisitions. We made dividend payments of $196 million and we spent $779 million to repurchase shares. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, down $555 million sequentially, but up $100 million from the prior year. And we ended the year in a net cash position of $370 million as we were able to make the previously mentioned investments without assuming any incremental debt. Of the $3.5 billion in cash, almost 16% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31, 2014. 
As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in our 10-year strategies, however, we will do so at a more measured pace than previously envisaged. As a result, we will expect to reduce year-to-year capital spending by 15%. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

We absolutely are continuing to look for larger transactions. Those take much -- typically take much longer to cultivate, and so we have had conversations with a few larger potential counterparties out there. What we generally find is in a declining market, it's hard to get the bid and the ask to converge. And most of those transactions are better accomplished and you get more agreement between the counterparties as markets are increasing. So I think until we begin to start to see a little bit of a recovery and a little bit stronger outlook, it's going to be hard to bid bids and ask to come together. But we're -- as you know, we're always out there looking for opportunities to deploy capital into good return opportunities and recognize that those conversations are long-term investments. And so we do have a couple going on now, but nothing -- really nothing to report. I don't think there's any sort of transaction out there that's imminent in the near-term."

We then assumed that we'd get some book in turn in Q4 and throughout 2015, that would take that number up. Given the pace of orders, we think it's probably going to be closer to that $7 billion range in terms of revenue flow and out of backlog this year, based on what we see today. Now we could receive some orders here in the next few months that we can turn into revenue before the end of the year, but right now, it's looking pretty soft.

But -- and I would add to that, too, our own suppliers we're in discussions with about reducing the prices that they charge us. We're hesitant though to wrap margin improvement around that scenario because, no doubt, we're going to continue to see price pressure and face challenges that are coming out of the current slow market."

When you think about the decline in oil today, and people like to reference 2009. But as we stand today, deepwater rig rates are coming down much more quickly in general that the backlogs of the offshore drillers is much less than that time frame and there's a probably a legitimate discussion that offshore rig rates could go close to cash breakeven. How do you think about Rig Systems and orders over the next 2 to 3 years if that happens? And how do you think shipyards will react, I mean, price standpoint? Last time, they reduced price, which helped. But will it really help if rig rates are at such a depressed level that they didn't even bother to reduce price because no one's going to order anyway?"

And as I said in the opening remarks, our plan is to manage to the market realities kind of quarter-by-quarter. We have a great backlog which we'll burn off over the next several quarters. As we find ourselves, let's say, this time next year without a resumption in orders in the offshore world, we expect 2 things to happen: One is our installation and commissioning efforts around the rigs that are being built will continue strong through 2015 and will end at 2016. As that starts to wind down a little bit though, we'll have good opportunities to pivot and refocus the technical capabilities of that group and the infrastructure that supports that group towards SPSs, which we do see rising in spite of the market challenges. We see opportunities to pivot and refocus that group towards more onshore aftermarket support. I think there's a great potential out there for NOV to build on its franchise in the land side and provide better aftermarket support of those customers. Likewise, on manufacturing, we expect to pivot and kind of refocus in the aftermarket opportunity around that. And then secondly -- that will help a lot. But secondly, we're going to be sizing to what the market dictates. As I also mentioned in my opening comments, we're outsourcing more than half of our machining work and rig, for instance. And so we have a lot of sort of flexible or flex supply chain out there that supports our efforts that we can diminish. And then thirdly, we've got 2 other big segments that have different cyclical behaviors. And so a recovery in rig counts in 2016 would do a lot to very rapidly lift demand by Wellbore Technologies, for machining capabilities, for assembly, and likewise, Completion & Production Solutions is on a little different cyclical trajectory. So we have -- by having 3 different segments that sort of has different cyclical behaviors, it gives us an opportunity to refocus resources into places that may need them."

A lot of credit capacity and expectation that as business slows, we will have cash come out of working capital and off of our balance sheet, plus $14.3 billion backlog translates to a pretty significant margin embedded in that backlog, which will turn to cash over the next year or 2. So we kind of entered this downturn with a lot of resources. And I think what that means is we have the capability to really do all of the above. And so we have very intentionally stepped up our focus on M&A, mostly around the smaller company opportunities, because frankly, they're more doable in this kind of market downturn. I think it's challenging for a public company to enter into an agreement to sell itself if it's not distressed, when its stock price is way below its 52-week high. And so it makes it difficult to do a larger transaction in this kind of environment. That's not to say -- like I mentioned earlier to Jim, that's not to say that we're not continuing conversations and surveying the landscape out there. But in terms of how we prioritize, I think we can do all of the above and do so in a way that doesn't sacrifice future flexibility, and do so in a way that keeps some powder dry for those opportunities as they arise. So that's kind of the thought process that we're going through. Specifically, with regard to the share buyback, I mean this is the company we know best. We can buy-in shares with no purchase premium and we can size those transactions to whatever size we feel comfortable with, which is why at our Analyst Day, we sort of linked the application of capital in the share buyback program to the repatriation of cash from overseas."

Actually, thankfully for us, it really hasn't created a big impact on our programs. If you remember back a few years ago when Petrobras set all this up, they set up a separate financing arm called Sete in Brazil that is actually the customer, and it went out and secured its equity partner investors and secured its bank financings and kind of -- and so it's sort of moving along separately without virtually -- there's virtually no capital support from Petrobras into those projects to construct the rigs. Where the support comes is in the contracts to operate those rigs once they're delivered. And that's still a couple of years out. But based upon Sete placing orders to construct these rigs with their partners, shipyards jumped in the fray and concluding a couple of new shipyards that were constructed for this program. And so those have been proceeding along relatively smoothly. That's not to say without some delays and some issues and some challenges that we fully expected, but by and large, those projects are moving ahead. We expect the first rig to be delivered I think Q3 or Q4 this year. And the first of 22 rigs that were signed up to deliver. And the specific challenges that, that group of projects and shipyards have faced have been more around cost overruns on the construction of the shipyards had led it -- that led to a few payment delays for us. We're working through that. And the good news here within the past few weeks, a couple of financing packages have been made available to Sete. I mentioned in my opening comments the Development Bank of Brazil. I think the Central Bank is involved, the Banco do Brasil. And then some of the Asian partners to some of the shipyards are also financing the completion of the construction of those yards. So net-net, we're in pretty decent shape. But I think important for NOV shareholders is that we are ahead. We received more payments than we had delivered equipment into these projects, and so very important to us that we maintain that position from a risk management. So we're in pretty good shape on this, Robin."

This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015, ex",3435,"Thank you, Loren, and welcome, everyone, to version 2.0 of National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015, excluding charges related to a voluntary retirement program, the write-down of Venezuela assets and a discrete non-recurring foreign tax exposure. Fully diluted earnings per share were $1.14, down 33% sequentially, down 12% year-over-year excluding other items from all quarters. Revenues were $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015, down 16% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Consolidated operating, profit excluding other items was $692 million or 14.4% of sales in the first quarter, decremental operating leverage was 37% sequentially. First quarter EBITDA excluding charges was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. This compares to $1.2 billion in the prior quarter and $1 billion in the first quarter of last year excluding other items from all periods. This is in the first quarter of 2015 decline significantly in response to lower oil prices. 
We entered 2015 with oil prices half of what they were just a few short months ago. Now all commodity prices signal producers to add or diminish supply and oil is no exception. So in the first quarter, with global supplies outpacing global demand by 1.5 million barrels per day, the oil price signal rolled through our industry like thunder and thunder struck participants responded vigorously. Spending is falling in almost all regions, driving the worldwide rig count down by 1/3 since September. The rate of decline of active rigs most acute and across North America is breathtaking and unequaled in prior downturns. NOV saw activities and orders slowed in just about all areas of our business and all of our units are experiencing pricing pressure. Most of us in the oil and gas industry have been through downturns lead times before and have honed our skills at rapidly adjusting spending through the cycles. So following record results for National Oilwell Varco in the fourth quarter of 2014, our revenue declined 16% in Q1 and is expected to decline further for at least the next few quarters. 
There's been much debate as to the shape and timing of the eventual oil price recovery. We don't know if we are in for a V-shape or a U-shape or a W-shape recovery, but we will all know soon because the industry is conducting its first grand global and empirical test of price elasticity of the supply of oil. What we do know is that North American oil shales are emerging as the new swing source of oil. Since 2011 and a $100 per barrel price environment, North American oil shales grew about 4.5 million barrels per day, while the rest of the world posted a half million barrel per day production decline. We know individuals shale wells declined exceedingly quickly, 8x to 10x the rate of conventional resources. We know that the sharp and rapid decline and the addition of fresh and new producing wells of all kinds will result in diminished global oil production over time. We also know that the excess productive capacity around the world, the oversupply is thankfully just a few percent, far less my first downturn of the 1980s. We also know that global economic activity which drives oil demand is not strong and that lower oil prices will act as an economic stimulus to many economies. The facts as we know them point to a pretty good foundation for an eventual recovery. All wells, all fields and all basins left wanting for investment inevitably declined. And economies need more energy to grow so demand for oil will grow driven by the engine of people desiring at better standard of living. Eventually supply and demand curves will cross and we will see oil processing signaling produces to get back to production growth. We just don't know when. And frankly, we can't wait for the eventual recovery. 
Therefore, 2015 will be a year for restructuring at NOV. Given our short term lack of visibility into the timing of recovery, our approach would be to focus on cost without sacrificing our long-term opportunities. We are managing our infrastructure to the market, reducing costs as utilization levels permit. This began in earnest in the first quarter when we reduced SG&A 8% coming off exceedingly high levels of utilization last year. We started with a voluntary early-retirement program for our long serving employees and this is being followed by reduction of facilities as workforce as utilization dictates. We are working to insource more of our production needs as utilization declines across our manufacturing plants with a goal of preserving as much work as possible for our plants and our teams. We expect to pull in about 650,000 machining hours from our vendors this year and another 600,000 machining hours next year in our Rig Systems segment, for example, and comparable efforts are underway in Wellbore Technologies and the other segments as well. While reductions in contract labor, overtime and shifts help mitigate decrementals, we will face underabsorption overall. We are also under pricing pressure and request to cancel work, which we are vigorously opposing. We are seeking to structure discounts around volume-related rebates, tied to payments and expanded product purchases. In effect, picking our points to try and win greater share, defend volumes and improve absorption in our plants. We don't want our customers to get out of the habit of buying from us to maximize our market position when the inevitable recovery comes. 
This downturn is an opportunity to become better. We have long focused on operational excellence, continually evolving to utilize modern techniques to be the best manufacturer. This downturn will drive us to improve efficiency and a supply chain straining for the last decade to accommodate extraordinarily high demands from our customers. Through the last decade, NOV responded with an exceptional level of effectiveness to a macro cycle upgrade to the fleet of equipment the industry relies on. The next challenge for us is to retrench and transform, to pivot to new opportunities that are emerging and to continue to lead the industry. To that end, we will continue to invest in numerous long-term growth opportunities to execute our long-term strategic plan. Technology and equipment have transformed our industry to enable accessing new frontiers like deepwater and access new sources of hydrocarbons from poor quality reservoir rocks like shales. 
NOV's DNA is to continue to apply purposeful innovation, to continually expand the opportunity set of attractive investments for our customers. This is a tough market with tough challenges, but they are not new to us. Given the difficult oil price backdrop, our first quarter orders were weak for our Rig Systems segment. We booked orders at $236 million, half of what we booked in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also booked a $99 million adjustment to our FX -- backlog related to FX related to contracts denominated in foreign currencies. Since the costs associated with these are also denominated in those same foreign currencies, there is no margin impact -- percentage impact, only a revenue back. Shipments out of backlog totaled $2.25 billion, yielding an ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. The quarter included 2 jack-up packages and a handful of land rigs mostly targeting Middle East and Latin America markets. 
Our outlook for orders for the second quarter is marginally better, but we remain slow as customers who need equipment are taking their time ordering. Areas of comparative strength are seen in platform rigs, fleet spares, components and software upgrades to improve tripping efficiency offshore, think iron roughnecks and handling tools, and DOPs, land rigs and well service rigs for North America and the Middle East. We continue to see growth in SPS projects despite some being postponed, some rigs being stacked or retired which had planned SPSs and other senior scope reduced. We believe contractors are seeking to differentiate the efficiency of their offshore rigs in a crowded marketplace, and this will shape our near-term offshore rig orders and that a desire for Tier 1 AC land rigs in international markets will characterize the next few quarters for land demand. We also expect many more offshore rig retirements in addition to the 30 plus already announced, which will speed the inevitable fleet high grading process and bring offshore rig supply demand into better balance. Many of our North American land customers indicate they want to pursue upgrading their fleets to Tier 1 in advance of a potential 2016 recovery. In a short run though, we expect continued soft orders as contractors struggle with lower day rates, cannibalized components off of stacked rigs in lieu of placing orders with NOV. Installation and commissioning activity around our existing offshore new-build backlog remains very high. However, in similar instances, we and the shipyards are working with the drilling contractors to delay rig deliveries. This helps the drilling contractors postpone stacking costs on uncontracted new-build deliveries and it will help us manage supply chain, freight and installation and commissioning costs more effectively and level load across our operations. We are also curtailing activity related to our Brazilian rigs which I'll speak to more in just a moment. As a consequence, we are in effect, shifting offshore revenue out of backlog into subsequent quarters. This will impact our near-term Rig Systems segment revenue forecast. 
Near-term total revenues for the Rig Systems segment will decline significantly in the second quarter due to this effect, as well as the expectation of lower revenues associated with land rig shipments in the second quarter. We expect second quarter revenues for this segment to be in the range of about $1.8 billion, down about 30% sequentially. Within our backlog at March 31, our orders for 22 drilling equipment packages for floating rigs for Brazil totaling $3.3 billion. At the time of our last call, the ultimate customer for these rigs, a financing vehicle 10% owned by Petrobras called Sete was within a day or 2 of securing long term financing to get current on payments to the Brazilian shipyards building these rigs which are NOV's contractual customers. Unfortunately, the corruption scandal in Brazil was linked to Sete just prior to signing, which resulted in the banks backing away from the proposed financing package deal on the table. Since then our Brazilian shipyards customers have come under significant financial stress due to a lack of payments from Sete. Currently we understand that the banks and the shareholders have granted Sete a 90-day window to seek a solution to its financing struggles, and we know that there is an intense level of activity around securing permanent financing solution involving several banks. The origin of the rig building program in Brazil arises from public-policy goals set forth by the government to foster a local oil field services and shipyard industry, to employ more Brazilians, and thus far Petrobras remains contractually committed to employing these locally built rigs once they are completed. There are specific requirements within the lease concessions for presold blocks granted to Petrobras by the Brazilian government, which require local content ranging from 37% to 55%. According to the Brazilian press, these local content requirements have created over 120,000 jobs in the country. We, therefore, continue to believe that there is considerable political pressure in Brazil to ultimately get these rigs built. We believe these rigs will eventually get built. We are engaged with our shipyard customers in Brazil however, to adjust manufacturing schedules for the now delayed programs and are slowing activity pending payment. Our contracts are still in place and the downpayments and progress billings we have achieved thus far exceed our investment as per our contracts. One of the 4 shipyards we are working for has continued to pay us due to their Asian partners stepping in to finance operations there. 
During the first quarter, we recognized $172 million in revenues associated with the program, about 7% of total segment revenues, but this will slow substantially for at least the next couple of quarters contributing to lower guidance for Rig Systems Q2 revenues. And apart from the [indiscernible] of these rigs, the components we have built [indiscernible] are marketable in the event of multiple default, which we still consider unlikely.  Overall, we remain confident in the eventual monetization of our existing contractual Rig Systems backlog both in Brazil and elsewhere, and are working with customers to modify schedules to accommodate the challenges they are facing and to ease the stress in our supply chain. 
Turning to our other segments, revenues from Rig Aftermarket fell 15% sequentially, more than we expected as drilling contractors curtailed expenditure sharply much more than we anticipated. We typically see that for several weeks of the year slow seasonally as contractors set budgets and then see spare parts orders and repair services pick up in March as contractors begin work under their new annual budgets. However, this year, the market's pick up never came and April has remained soft. We expect flat sequential revenues in the second quarter with rising SPS work and relatively strong demand in the Middle East offset by mounting price pressure on repair, services and drilling expendables, which will drive margins lower by a couple of 100 basis points. Our strategy within Rig Aftermarket is unchanged to capitalize on our leading and growing installed base of NOV equipment to provide OEM support close to our customers' rigs. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment declined 23% sequentially with all major business units posting declines and significant price pressure tied to drilling activity. Drill pipe sales declined the most, coming off an exceptional fourth quarter which was near record, and orders for drill pipe slowed to a trickle in the first quarter as most operators are cannibalizing pipe from idle rigs in lieu of buying new pipe. Looking into the second quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies to decline in the double-digit percentage range at a high decremental margins as discounting continues to outpace the speed of our cost reductions. One bright spot within Wellbore Technologies is our IntelliServ Wire Drill Pipe unit and new close loop drilling automation services through our dynamic drilling solutions business unit that continue to attract operator interest through demonstrated reductions in drilling times. We are very excited about the potential of this technology to transform drilling efficiency and materially improve E&P drilling economics and shales in the deepwater and in other basins around the globe. 
Completion & Production Solutions segment revenues declined 28% sequentially at 28% decremental margins as most products within this group saw slighting demand. Our backlog for Completion & Production Solutions segment declined 18% during the first quarter as net new orders at $327 million were offset by revenues out of backlog of $563 million and an FX adjustment of $81 million. Demand for composite pipe and processing flow products saw book-to-bill levels close to one in the first quarter, but we saw sharp declines in pressure pumping equipment demand. Orders for flexibles and FPSO products also fell sort of revenues out of backlog. Ending backlog for the first quarter was $1.46 billion. We are pleased that our FPSO business achieved record revenue levels in the first quarter with great progress on existing projects. Interest by IOCs and NOCs in our FPSO strategy has risen considerably through the past few quarters at operators are actively seeking to pioneer new ways of constructing these complex vessels to achieve on time, on budget deliveries and ultimately improve development economics. The industry appears to be latching on to our standardization and modular construction thesis, recognizing that we must do things differently to develop the billions of barrels that have been discovered in the deepwater. Design 1, build 2 is a great idea. We are engaged on a dozen or so projects but project awards are going slowly as most are conducting extended feed studies to reengineer and recalibrate costs and waiting for deflation in the supply chains. We continue to believe that NOV's extensive experience in managing complex equipment, vessel integration projects in shipyards positions us well to pioneer a better way in FPSO construction. 
As we expected, our pressure pumping product sales fell sharply during the first quarter as customers delayed picking up their orders and pressed hard for pricing concessions. We closed 3 facilities within the unit during the first quarter and continue to reduce costs within our supply chain. North America was hit hardest, but the Middle East and other international markets were more stable, a recurring theme through many of our businesses. Looking to the second quarter we expect revenues to decline a few percentage points but margins to fall further as the full force of discounting kicks in. Obviously, our second quarter outlook across all our segments are very guarded and our situation is fluid. While we face a difficult market near term, we will be looking for revenues to stabilize across Rig Aftermarket, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions in the second half of the year, and we will manage Rig Systems to the backlog and work available in the marketplace. The significant drilling cost deflation underway will benefit producers, a modest oil price rebound coupled with lower drilling cause may bring about green shoots of activity in the second half and we'll be watching closely. But as I said, we plan to manage to whatever size the market is across all of our businesses quarter-by-quarter. 
Prior downturns in our industry have provided great opportunity for those with capital and foresight to look through near-term adversity. NOV is a remarkable franchise. We are also at the forefront of several transformative trends in the oil business. Close loop drilling automation and FPSO supply chain management are 2 I mentioned earlier. Add to the list the key global supplier of pressure pumping and coil tubing technology which have enabled hydraulic fracture stimulation in the shale revolution. Gas pipe conductor connections, thermal desorption technologies to clean up drill cuttings for safety disposal, RFID technologies to track the myriad of assets used by this industry, flexible pipe systems for subsea developments, water desalination, de-oiling and sand separation technologies, reel composite pipe for flow lines, bits, drill pipe and top drives used to set a world record on an extended reach well exceeding 8 miles a few weeks ago, permanent magnet advancements for rotating equipment. Although the industry is still in the early innings of upgrading to AC electronic control rigs, we are at work designing the next generation of drilling rigs, and we will be there with new and better technology for the inevitable upturn. 
We continue to invest in technology and new products to grow organically, and we will continue to pursue interesting acquisitions in this environment, making sure that we are very disciplined about valuations in view of the current market challenges. We closed 2 transactions so far in 2015 and has several more negotiations underway. We have also retired 10% of our shares outstanding through the past several months given our stock price downturn because we view it as an extraordinarily opportunity to reduce our cost of capital in a historically low interest rate environment. Our debt increased $1.1 billion as a result, but with our $3 billion cash balance, net debt is still only $1.2 billion, about 6% of capitalization. I will note too that we are currently slowing our share repurchases in view of some potential acquisition candidates coming into sharper focus. 
I am proud of the leadership NOV employees provide in this endeavor. While the current market is very tough, we are well-positioned with strong financial and operating resources and an industry-leading installed base of complex equipment in need of continuing close OEM aftermarket support. I am grateful to all of the great NOV employees who are remaining focused on taking care of our customers through this difficult time. We announced last week that our CFO, Jeremy Thigpen, has left us to become CEO at one of our important offshore drilling customers, Transocean Limited. We appreciate Jeremy's leadership through 18 years of service here, in both finance and operations, and we wish him and Transocean the very best. Our very talented Chief Accounting Officer, Scott Duff, has agreed to serve as interim CFO as we conduct a search process for our next CFO, and our long serving Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations, Loren Singletary, here with me today, will pinch it on today's call to step us through the detailed financial results by segment. So with that, let me turn it over to Loren."
31900,286151112,795490,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to execute on our backlog completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in th",3026,"Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to execute on our backlog completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in the quarter. Operating profit for the segment was $488 million, yielding an operating margin of 19.3%, down 70 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. EBITDA was $511 million or 20.3% of sales. Q4 to Q1, offshore revenues, which represent 75% of the segment total, declined slightly, and land revenues, which represent 25% of the segment total, remained flat. Segment margins fell slightly as bad debt accruals more than offset cost reduction efforts in the quarter. 
And let's discuss capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco's Rig Systems. In the first quarter, we received $263 million in new orders and recognized $2.25 billion of revenue out of backlog and an FX adjustment of $99 million, resulting in a book-to-bill 0.11x and a quarter-ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. As Clay mentioned earlier, orders were half of what they were in Q4, and Q1 was one of the first quarters in recent history where land bookings outweighed offshore bookings. Of the total $10.4 billion in backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As we move into the second quarter of 2015, Clay noted that the NOV Rig Systems revenues would decline as much as 30%. We expect revenue out of backlog to slow to the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from Q1's $2.25 billion as we shift fewer land rigs and see the impact of accommodating certain customers requested delivery modifications for offshore new-builds. We believe margins will decline into the mid-teens percentage from 19.3% in the first quarter. Our goal is working with our customers on these scheduled modifications -- scheduling modifications to maximize the margins on contracts we have in hand and to maintain our core team capable of exceptional performance. This is the right thing to do for our franchise and for our shareholders.  
As we have noted many times before, NOV and our shipyard partners have been extremely busy scaling to large numbers of offshore floating new-build projects through the past few years, most with build schedules of less than 3 years which is a considerably faster pace than the 4 year plus delivery schedules that characterized orders from 2005 through 2008. This shift has resulted in higher cost from a supply chain and NOV infrastructure straining to accommodate these more aggressive delivery schedules. Our record results of 2014 to meet these demanding deliveries drove up over time and air freight and extended our supply chain past optimal cost.  Spreading the work out now to later quarters gives us time to manage our supply chain cost down to achieve lower pricing from our vendors, to avoid excess overtime cost and to tackle these projects with our core team in a more efficient, more measured way. And as Clay noted, it helps our customers cope with our stacking cost on certain uncontracted rigs. Our revenue recognition out of backlog will likely be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the next few quarters. And we expect total segment revenues for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.8 billion. 
Our outlook for further offshore new-builds remains for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless we do expect to see some orders for offshore capital equipment as our customers seek efficiency-driven upgrades and spare parts to support their existing rig fleets and SPS activities that will occur. On land, we expect to see continued demand for Tier 1 AC-driven land rigs and international markets, particularly the Middle East and Latin America. Given our outlook, we are aggressively managing costs down on all fronts. 
National Oilwell Varco aftermarkets generated revenues of $719 million in the first quarter of 2013, down 15% sequentially and down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Revenues fell harder than anticipated as precipitous decline in land rig activity and stacking of relatively younger rigs negatively impacted demand across the aftermarket business. Operating profit for the segment was $199 million, resulting in operating margins of 27.7%, down 110 basis points sequentially but up 220 basis points year-over-year. Decremental margins were 35% and EBITDA was $206 million or 28.7% of sales. While there is some seasonality in the first quarter revenues for aftermarket, the sequential decline was driven primarily by depressed activity levels. Uncertainty in the marketplace led to our customers' reduced spending and consuming existing inventories, cannibalizing its existing idle rigs, postpone, repair and upgrade work while they watch and waited like us for signs of market normalization. Margins contracted on a reduced volume, and the discounts made in selected areas to maintain existing customer relationships. Land represented an increased percentage of total segment revenues, up 20% in the fourth quarter to 25% in the first, driven by higher activity in Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, we recently expanded our service and repair facilities to align more closely with our customers' operation, including 2 new facilities in the United States to support activity in the Permian and the Marcellus. 
As we move into the second quarter, we believe National Oilwell Varco aftermarket revenues are stable, and we will remain flattish with a slight increase in spare parts and rising SPS work, offset by rising discounting pressures. Revenues from SPS activities, which occur on a 5-year basis, have become much harder to time as some likely candidates for survey work are stacked or retired amidst the challenging offshore market condition. But nevertheless, our SPS project count is set to grow in the second quarter. 
Operating margins will remain under pressure and may decline slightly from Q1's 27.7% for several reasons. In the second quarter, we will see the full effect of discounts we made from key customers in the first quarter, mostly in repair and services and competitive drilling expendables and we anticipate our customer to choose lower margin repair work over refurbishment programs, preferring to do the minimum required for maintenance versus large SPSs. Our longer-term outlook for this group remains very bright, owing to the significant upgrade in rig technology of work at work in newer, more modern fleets with higher mix of NOV equipment and much larger installed base which carries a pressing need for greater OEM aftermarket support. 
For the first quarter of 2015, National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $1.2 billion, down 23% sequentially and 8% compared to first quarter of 2014 reflecting drilling activity declines. Operating profit for the segment was $124 million resulting in operating margins of 10.6% down 750 basis points sequentially and 690 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Sequential decrementals were 42.5%, which were slightly better than anticipated, owing to swift cost reduction efforts across the board. EBITDA for the segment was $229 million or 19.6% of revenue. NOV Wellbore Technologies carries a disproportionately large amount of the company's total $190 million DNA load due to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, manufacturing and service facility infrastructure and a sizable middle fleet in 2 of the segment's larger business units. Drilling activity drives NOV Wellbore Technologies. Though drilling activity has not completely abated, average global rig count fell 25% from the fourth quarter average. National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies may be a global business, but it has a significant exposure to North America where rig count declines were the most severe. In the first quarter, U.S. rig count activity fell by nearly 800 rigs, declining 66 rigs per week on average. In 2008 and '09, during the financial crisis, the pace of rig count declines averaged 55 rigs per week at its deepest point. In Canada, unseasonably early breakup meant rig count was down 40% below the previous year. Our largest businesses were some of the most affected by the depressed activity levels namely downhole tools, bits, motors, drill pipe and solids control and waste management equipment. And in the current environment, our customers are pressing hard for discounts and are committed to preserving our market leading -- and we are committed to preserving our market-leading positions during the downturn. 
We are currently experiencing the fastest land rig count -- U.S. land rig count decline in 20 years and the outlook remains tenuous. Looking into the second quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies will be down mid-teens percentage from $1.2 billion on lower activity levels, and margins could decline to mid-single digits from 10.6% with mid-40% decrementals, similar to the first quarter sequential average. Fewer rigs drilling fewer wells imply less demand for Wellbore Technologies tools and services. While there is demand, competition will be high and pricing pressure will be very fierce. We are actively reducing cost across the segment to reflect reduced activity levels. Cost reductions lagged revenue declines as we rightsize service and manufacturing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the cost reduction measures we are taking will better position us when the market does turn. 
In today's lower commodity price environment, our customers remain focused on improving economic and drilling efficiencies. At NOV, we are developing new technologies that will help them achieve their goals such as tectonic drill bits, which we are introducing at next week's OTC, new proprietary threads on drill pipe and closed loop drilling automation systems. We continue to believe that new products are the lifeblood of any technology company, and we are proud to say that even in today's down market, our new technologies are gaining traction, and we will continue to innovate on next generation technologies. 
National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $948 million for the first quarter of 2015, down 28% sequentially and 5% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $108 million, resulting in an operating margin of 11.4% down 480 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 28%, and first quarter EBITDA for the segment was $163 million or 17.2% of sales. Q4 to Q1 demand declined almost equally for both shorter cycle, activity-driven revenues and revenues from backlog. Declines were primarily driven by nearly 40% reduction in revenues for a higher-margin offshore completion equipment as strong fourth quarter deliveries did not repeat in the first quarter and North American completion activity slowed. Segment revenues related to production both on land and offshore were also negatively impacted by the reduced E&P spending. 
Now let's discuss our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions. In the first quarter, we received $327 million in new orders and recognized $563 million of revenue out of backlog, along with an $81 million FX adjustment, resulting in a book to bill of 0.58x and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.5 billion, down 18% sequentially. Orders were down 30% from the $469 million won in Q4, although orders for composite pipe processing technologies showed relative strength in the quarter. Of the total $1.5 billion backlog, approximately 69% is offshore and 82% is international. As we move into the second quarter, we believe revenues will tick down slightly from $948 million recognized in the first quarter. We expect revenue out of backlog will be in the range of plus or minus $500 million. Given the current market uncertainty, we anticipate reduced demand and increased pricing pressure for equipment and technologies across the segment which will reduce margins into the high single digits which implies low 20% decremental margins. As in other segments, we are actively reducing cost in the NOV Completion & Production Solutions to reflect lower levels of activity. Our order outlook for onshore completion equipment remains soft, particularly for the North American pressure pumping market as customers struggled with low utilization of existing equipment -- as customers struggle with low utilization of existing equipment. We see customers cannibalizing spare parts and using existing stock whenever possible, but expect demand for repair and maintenance to return well in advance of orders for full frac spreads and coiled tubing units. By nature, the FPSO-related bookings are uneven quarter-to-quarter.  In today's lower commodity price environment, we expect orders to slow as customers recalibrate cost for offshore production projects, although feed-related activities and attributed to pre-salt work continues. 
Now let's discuss our financials statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the first quarter of 2015, you will see across the gross margin declined 270 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year to 24.4%. SG&A decreased 8% or $42 million sequentially as we continue to make efforts to reduce costs across all our business segments. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was up 90 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%. Other items were $122 million in the quarter due to charges related to our early-retirement plans. Interest expense and interest income were flat sequentially at $26 million and $5 million respectively. As compared to 2014, interest expense remain $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to -- from $4 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV decreased $7 million sequentially to $9 million as demand for casing and drill pipe and therefore grain tube moderate. Compared to first quarter of 2014, equity income slightly decreased by $1 million. For the second quarter and full year 2015, we believe year-over-year equity income will continue to fall as demand for casing and drill pipe decreases. Other expenses for the quarter was $56 million which represented a $36 million delta sequentially primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currencies and write-offs. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.6% which was an additional 9.5% over the 28.1% rate that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been 28.9%. We believe that a 30% to 31% effective tax rate for NOV continues to be a realistic estimate for the remainder of 2015.  If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you will see that eliminations were $541 million for the quarter, down slightly from $556 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $227 million in the quarter, down $2 million sequentially on lower volume of intersegment revenues. And, finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you'll see that depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $190 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1 million from the prior year.  EBITDA for the first quarter excluding other items was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our March 31, 2015 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.8 billion up $355 million or 6.6% sequentially. Several factors contributed to the increase and we expect working capital to convert to cash and begin to fall later in the year. The largest impact stems from our net of cost in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost and customer prepayments, which together make up the level of customer financing of our working capital and are tied to prepayments and progress billings. As orders have declined, downpayments have declined, and our progress on projects is outpacing our progress payments which we saw in the previous downturn of 2009 and which will continue for the next few quarters. Working capital impact of this was $425 million in the first quarter. Offsetting items include our accounts receivable which decreased $392 million or 9% sequentially due to lower revenues. Inventory increased $97 million or 1.8% sequentially, mostly due to the transfer of certain short -- mostly due to the transfer of certain short live downhole rail tools from PP&E into inventory. While inventory is declining across most businesses, others are still receiving components order into construction schedules and we expect inventory to decline later in the year as we adjust our supply chain. We also have some customers postponing received orders due to market conditions which should turnaround in this quarter. Also, leading to a sequential increase in working capital, accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued liabilities decreased $419 million, which they do every year in the first quarter. 
For the quarter, the company generated $114 million in cash flow from operation. Capital spending for the first quarter was $130 million, down 44% sequentially. In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $85 million and we spent $1.33 billion to repurchase 24.5 million shares for a total of 2.1 billion in share repurchases under our $3 billion authorization. To fund the share repurchases in the quarter, we borrowed $1.1 billion using our commercial paper program, which increased total debt to $4.2 billion, and our net debt to capitalization to a very manageable 6.4%. As a result, we ended the first quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $3 billion, down $512 million sequentially. Of that $3 billion in cash, almost 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at March 31, 2015. 
In summary, we saw spending and orders slow in all areas of the business as lower commodity price drove down E&P, capital spending and drilling activity, and we have a challenging quarter ahead as we see the full impact of reduced activity levels and pricing pressures on our business. As an industry, we are actively reducing costs throughout the supply chain as we seek new levels of efficiency. While it is early and uncertain, we are encouraged as rig count decline began to slow and we get closer to the trough levels. Deflationary costs may entice improved levels of activity, and as our industry improves from a contraction mode to an expansion mode, NOV will start to see the full effect of the cost reduction efforts we are making today. Our continued investment in technologies, capacity and aftermarket support had made us the oil field's preferred equipment and technology provider. And as we pivot to new opportunities, we expect National Oilwell Varco to emerge a stronger, more resilient and more dependable partner for customers. 
With that, we would like to open up for questions."

We benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade and have been a big participant in that. And we've also done a lot, we've been very transactional and invested in a lot of M&A capital in the last decade. And we look back in the past 10 years, 97% of our M&A capital have gone into our other 3 segments, really away from the rig building space, building out really interesting positions, trying to position us for option value across multiple trends underway. So when we look at for instance, a shale well drilling operation, what you see out there is a Tier 1 rig premium drill pipe, downhole tools, mud motors. You see on the completion side, coiled tubing units and coiled tubing, frac spreads, sanders, mixing units, basically all of the picks and shovels, all of the hardware that go into the unconventional shale trend, NOV is a global leading provider of. We look across oilfield and we see opportunities in waste management, and so things like thermal desorption technology to clean up drill cuttings, water management opportunities, we got some great technologies around osmosis cleanup and desalinization of water, the oiling of water with our Waterwolf products, so we're doing more on the production side. So this has been a -- we had a steady application of capital into other trends, recognizing that this industry always changes. And over the past few years, of course, the big change where the shales have emerged as a much lower marginal cost source of oil, and the deepwater has some challenges, but I also know from cycle to cycle, marginal costs will rearrange themselves. There's a lot of smart people in this industry focused on their particular resource base and with regards to the deepwater, I think certainly the marginal costs out there coming down, and NOV plans on being a part of that. So when it comes to building FPSO vessels, the industry's been challenged. We think we have some great ideas to apply there to bring costs down. The owners of the deepwater reservoirs are experiencing much lower drilling costs with the deflation that's gone on in the drilling space. And these joint ventures that you've heard about that are really focused in subsea processes, I think you're going to have a great benefit to. There's a lot to be made here with reducing back pressures on reservoirs, subsea lifting, subsea separation, and I think you kind of add all that up and marginal cost for deepwater reserves are going to come down. What we try to do at NOV is to position ourselves across these various trends and really sort of maximize option value in the participation of all these trends. So looking forward, we see great opportunity as all participants try to reduce their marginal cost. We also see a lot more NOV equipment out there that's going to need a lot more aftermarket support. And we've been investing in that footprint globally and are going to be there to take care of those rigs."

I think the challenge for management is to make sure we'll be looking through this and continuing to work on long-term strategic plans and execute our long-term vision, which is still very, very exciting. With regards to the offshore, like I mentioned earlier, all sources of crude are continually reducing their marginal cost, slide down that marginal cost curve and not be the last barrel produced in terms of economic efficiency. Offshore is absolutely no exception. And so what's encouraging about what we see today is that $100 a barrel, there's not as much incentive to do things differently. When oil price drops to $50 a barrel and IOCs have found for instance 5 billion barrels in the lower tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a stronger incentive to figure out. They know the research basis there, how do we figure out how to produce that at lower cost and they got the extra tailwind of drilling process deflation. Pricing is dropping for services on drilling those wells on the rigs required, day rates around the rigs required to drill those walls, and so it's a pretty good backdrop to do things differently, and there's a lot of active and constructive participation from the customers around that. We will bring the marginal cost down on subsea barrels."

I will tell you specifically where we've been deploying capital last couple of years has really enhanced our aftermarket business in particular around rig. The rising installed base of NOV equipment and technology out there's pretty transparent to you and everybody. And so what we see are a lot more NOV rigs running and a lot more customers in need of close OEM support. What we find is that these great little businesses that we can acquire, in fact, 2 weeks ago I was touring one that we bought in West Africa for instance, South Africa, that's been a great addition and great reputation, and what we've been able to bring to that business is kind of the NOV global reach and scale. So that's been a great help for our customers in that region but are on the would all of our customers want us to be closer to the phase, closer to their rigs for aftermarket support. So that's an interesting area and that's part of the reason at our Analyst Day we said, hey, growth prospects for Rig Aftermarket long-term are terrific and we're putting capital behind that. In other businesses, again, we've got opportunities to grow those, expand their footprint and so they're kind of a similar pattern."

This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015.",3436,"Thank you, Loren, and welcome, everyone, to version 2.0 of National Oilwell Varco's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. 
This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015. Excluding charges related to voluntary retirement program, the write-down of Venezuela assets and a discrete nonrecurring foreign tax exposure, fully diluted earnings per share were $1.14, down 33% sequentially, down 12% year-over-year excluding other items from all quarters. Revenues were $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015, down 16% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. 
Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $692 million or 14.4% of sales in the first quarter. Decremental operating leverage was 37% sequentially. First quarter EBITDA excluding charges was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. This compares to $1.2 billion in the prior quarter and $1 billion in the first quarter of last year excluding other items from all periods. 
Business in the first quarter of 2015 declined significantly in response to lower oil prices. We entered 2015 with oil prices half of what they were just a few short months ago. Now all commodity prices signal producers to add or diminish supply, and oil is no exception. So in the first quarter, with global supplies outpacing global demand by 1.5 million barrels per day, the oil price signal rolled through our industry like thunder, and thunderstruck participants responded vigorously. Spending is falling in almost all regions, driving the worldwide rig count down by 1/3 since September. The rate of decline of active rigs most acute in -- across North America is breathtaking and unequaled in prior downturns. 
NOV saw activities and orders slow in just about all areas of our business, and all of our units are experiencing pricing pressure. Most of us in oilfield -- in the oil and gas industry have been through downturns and lead times before and have honed our skills at rapidly adjusting spending through the cycles. So following record results for National Oilwell Varco in the fourth quarter of 2014, our revenue declined 16% in Q1 and is expected to decline further for at least the next few quarters. 
There's been much debate as to the shape and timing of the eventual oil price recovery. We don't know if we are in for a V-shaped or a U-shaped or a W-shaped recovery, but we will all know soon because the industry is conducting its first grand global empirical test of price elasticity of the supply of oil. What we do know is that North American oil shales are emerging as the new swing source of oil. Since 2011, in a $100 per barrel price environment, North American oil shales grew about 4.5 million barrels per day while the rest of the world posted a 0.5 million barrel per day production decline. 
We know individual shale wells decline exceedingly quickly, 8 to 10x the rate of conventional resources. We know that the sharp and rapid decline and the addition of fresh and new producing wells of all kinds will result in diminished global oil production over time. We also know that the excess productive capacity around the world, the oversupply, is, thankfully, just a few percent, far less than my first downturn of the 1980s. We also know that global economic activity, which drives oil demand, is not strong and that lower oil prices will act as an economic stimulus to many economies. 
The facts as we know them point to a pretty good foundation for an eventual recovery. All wells, all fields and all basins left wanting for investment inevitably decline. And economies need more energy to grow, so demand for oil will grow, driven by the engine of people desiring a better standard of living. Eventually, supply and demand curves will cross and we will see oil prices signaling producers to get back to production growth. We just don't know when, and frankly, we can't wait for the eventual recovery. 
Therefore, 2015 will be a year for restructuring at NOV. Given our short-term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach will be to focus on costs without sacrificing our long-term opportunities. We are managing our infrastructure to the market, reducing costs as utilization levels permit. This began in earnest in the first quarter when we reduced SG&A 8%, coming off exceedingly high levels of utilization last year. We started with a voluntary early-retirement program for our long-serving employees, and this is being followed by reductions in facilities as workforce -- and workforce as utilization dictates. 
We are working to in-source more of our production needs as utilization declines across our manufacturing plants, with a goal of preserving as much work as possible for our plants and our teams. We expect to pull in about 650,000 machining hours from our vendors this year and another 600,000 machining hours next year in our Rig Systems segment, for example, and comparable efforts are underway in Wellbore Technologies and the other segments as well. 
While reductions in contract labor, overtime and shifts help mitigate decrementals, we will face underabsorption overall. We are also under pricing pressure and request to cancel work, which we are vigorously opposing. We are seeking to structure discounts around volume-related rebates tied to payments and expanded product purchases, in effect, picking our points to try and win greater share, defend volumes and improve absorption in our plants. We don't want our customers to get out of the habit of buying from us to maximize our market position when the inevitable recovery comes. 
This downturn is an opportunity to become better. We have long focused on operational excellence, continuing -- continually evolving to utilize modern techniques to be the best manufacturer. This downturn will drive us to improve efficiency in a supply chain straining, through the last decade, to accommodate extraordinarily high demands from our customers. Through the last decade, NOV responded with an exceptional level of effectiveness to a macrocycle upgrade to the fleet of equipment the industry relies on. The next challenge for us is to retrench and transform, to pivot to new opportunities that are emerging and to continue to lead the industry. To that end, we will continue to invest in numerous long-term growth opportunities to execute our long-term strategic plan. 
Technology and equipment have transformed our industry to enable accessing new frontiers like deepwater and to access new sources of hydrocarbons from poor-quality reservoir rocks like shales. NOV's DNA is to continue to apply purposeful innovation to continually expand the opportunity set of attractive investments for our customers. 
This is a tough market with tough challenges, but they are not new to us. 
Given the difficult oil price backdrop, our first quarter orders were weak for our Rig Systems segment. We booked orders of $236 million, half of what we booked in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also booked a $99 million adjustment to our FX -- to our backlog related to FX related to contracts denominated in foreign currencies. Since the costs associated with these are also denominated in those same foreign currencies, there is no margin impact -- percentage impact, only a revenue impact. 
Shipments out of backlog totaled $2.25 billion, yielding an ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. The quarter included 2 jack-up packages and a handful of land rigs mostly targeting Middle East and Latin America markets. 
Our outlook for orders for the second quarter is marginally better, but will remain slow as customers who need equipment are taking their time ordering. Areas of comparative strength are seen in platform rigs, fleet spares, components and software upgrades to improve tripping efficiency offshore, think Iron Roughnecks and handling tools, and BOPs, land rigs and well service rigs for Latin America and the Middle East. 
We continue to see growth in SPS projects despite some being postponed, some rigs being stacked or retired, which had planned SPSs, and other senior scope reduced. We believe contractors are seeking to differentiate the efficiency of their offshore rigs in a crowded marketplace, and this will shape our near-term offshore rig orders and that a desire for Tier 1 AC land rigs in international markets will characterize the next few quarters for land demand. We also expect many more offshore rig retirements in addition to the 30-plus already announced, which will speed the inevitable fleet high-grading process and bring offshore rig supply/demand into better balance. 
Many of our North American land customers indicate they want to pursue upgrading their fleets to Tier 1 in advance of a potential 2016 recovery. In the short run though, we expect continued soft orders as contractors struggle with lower day rates, cannibalized components off of stacked rigs in lieu of placing new orders with NOV. Installation and commissioning activity around our existing offshore new-build backlog remains very high. However, in several instances, we and the shipyards are working with the drilling contractors to delay rig deliveries. This helps the drilling contractors postpone stacking costs on uncontracted new-build deliveries, and it will help us manage supply chain, freight and installation and commissioning costs more effectively and level load across our operations. 
We are also curtailing activity related to our Brazilian rigs, which I'll speak to more in just a moment. As a consequence, we are, in effect, shifting offshore revenue out of backlog into subsequent quarters. This will impact our near-term Rig Systems segment revenue forecast. Near-term total revenues for the Rig Systems segment will decline significantly in the second quarter due to this effect as well as the expectation of lower revenues associated with land rig shipments in the second quarter. We expect second quarter revenues for this segment to be in the range of about $1.8 billion, down about 30% sequentially. 
Within our backlog at March 31 are orders for 22 drilling equipment packages for floating rigs for Brazil totaling $3.3 billion. At the time of our last call, the ultimate customer for these rigs, a financing vehicle 10% owned by Petrobras called Sete, was within a day or 2 of securing long-term financing to get current on payments to the Brazilian shipyards building these rigs, which are NOV's contractual customers. Unfortunately, the corruption scandal in Brazil was linked to Sete just prior to signing, which resulted in the banks backing away from the proposed financing package then on the table. 
Since then, our Brazilian shipyard customers have come under significant financial stress due to a lack of payments from Sete. Currently, we understand that the banks and the shareholders have granted Sete a 90-day window to seek a solution to its financing struggles, and we know that there is an intense level of activity around securing permanent financing solution involving several banks. 
The origin of the rig-building program in Brazil arises from public-policy goals set forth by the government to foster a local oil field services and shipyard industry to employ more Brazilians, and thus far, Petrobras remains contractually committed to employing these locally built rigs once they are completed. There are specific requirements within the lease concessions for pre-salt blocks granted to Petrobras by the Brazilian government, which require local content ranging from 37% to 55%. 
According to the Brazilian press, these local content requirements have created over 120,000 jobs in the country. We, therefore, continue to believe that there is considerable political pressure in Brazil to ultimately get these rigs built. We believe these rigs will eventually get built. We are engaged with our shipyard customers in Brazil, however, to adjust manufacturing schedules for the now delayed programs and are slowing activity pending payment. Our contracts are still in place, and the downpayments and progress billings we have achieved thus far exceed our investment as per our contracts. One of the 4 shipyards we are working for has continued to pay us due to their Asian partners stepping in to finance operations there. 
During the first quarter, we recognized $172 million in revenues associated with the program, about 7% of total segment revenues, but this will slow substantially for at least the next couple of quarters, contributing to our lower guidance for Rig Systems' Q2 revenues. And apart from the derricks on these rigs, the components we have built in WIP are marketable in the event of ultimate default, which we still consider unlikely. Overall, we remain confident in the eventual monetization of our existing contractual Rig Systems backlog both in Brazil and elsewhere and are working with customers to modify schedules to accommodate the challenges they are facing and to ease the stress on our supply chain. 
Turning to our other segments. Revenues from Rig Aftermarket fell 15% sequentially, more than we expected as drilling contractors curtailed expenditure sharply, much more than we anticipated. We typically see the first several weeks of the year slow seasonally as contractors set budgets and then see spare parts orders and repair services pick up in March as contractors begin work under their new annual budgets. However, this year, the market pickup never came and April has remained soft. 
We expect flattish sequential revenues in the second quarter, with rising SPS work and relatively strong demand in the Middle East offset by mounting price pressure on repair, services and drilling expendables, which will drive margins lower by a couple of hundred basis points. Our strategy within Rig Aftermarket is unchanged: to capitalize on our leading and growing installed base of NOV equipment to provide OEM support close to our customers' rigs. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment declined 23% sequentially, with all major business units posting declines and significant price pressure tied to drilling activity. Drill pipe sales declined the most, coming off an exceptional fourth quarter, which was near a record, and orders for drill pipe slowed to a trickle in the first quarter as most operators are cannibalizing pipe from idle rigs in lieu of buying new pipe. Looking into the second quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies to decline in the double-digit percentage range at high decremental margins as discounting continues to outpace the speed of our cost reductions. 
One bright spot within Wellbore Technologies is our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe unit and new closed-loop drilling automation services through our dynamic drilling solutions business unit that continue to attract operator interest through demonstrated reductions in drilling times. We are very excited about the potential of this technology to transform drilling efficiency and materially improve E&P drilling economics in shales, in the deepwater and in other basins around the globe. 
Completion & Production Solutions segment revenues declined 28% sequentially at 28% decremental margins as most products within this group saw sliding demand. Our backlog for Completion & Production Solutions segment declined 18% during the first quarter as net new orders of $327 million were offset by revenues out of backlog of $563 million and an FX adjustment of $81 million. Demand for composite pipe and process and flow products saw book-to-bill levels close to 1 in the first quarter, but we saw sharp declines in pressure pumping equipment demand. Orders for flexibles and FPSO products also fell short of revenues out of backlog.  Ending backlog for the first quarter was $1.46 billion. 
We are pleased that our FPSO turret business achieved record revenue levels in the first quarter, with great progress on existing projects. Interest by IOCs and NOCs in our FPSO strategy has risen considerably through the past few quarters as operators are actively seeking to pioneer new ways of constructing these complex vessels to achieve on-time, on-budget deliveries and ultimately improve development economics. The industry appears to be latching onto our standardization and modular construction thesis, recognizing that we must do things differently to develop the billions of barrels that have been discovered in the deepwater. 
""Design 1, build 2"" is a great idea. We are engaged on a dozen or so projects, but project awards are going slowly as most are conducting extended FEED studies to reengineer and recalibrate costs and waiting for deflation in the supply chains. We continue to believe that NOV's extensive experience in managing complex equipment, vessel integration projects and shipyards positions us well to pioneer a better way in FPSO construction. 
As we expected, our pressure pumping product sales fell sharply during the first quarter as customers delayed picking up their orders and pressed hard for pricing concessions. We closed 3 facilities within the unit during the first quarter and continue to reduce costs within our supply chain. North America was hit hardest, but the Middle East and other international markets were more stable, a recurring theme through many of our businesses. Looking to the second quarter, we expect revenues to decline a few percentage points but margins to fall further as the full force of discounting kicks in. 
Obviously, our second quarter outlook across all our segments is very guarded, and our situation is fluid. While we face a difficult market near term, we will be looking for revenues to stabilize across Rig Aftermarket, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions in the second half of the year, and we will manage Rig Systems to the backlog and work available in the marketplace. The significant drilling cost deflation underway will benefit producers. A modest oil price rebound, coupled with lower drilling costs, may bring about some green shoots of activity in the second half, and we'll be watching closely. But as I said, we plan to manage to whatever size the market is across all of our businesses quarter by quarter. 
Prior downturns in our industry have provided great opportunity for those with capital and foresight to look through near-term adversity. NOV is a remarkable franchise. We are also at the forefront of several transformative trends in the oil business. Closed-loop drilling automation and FPSO supply chain management are 2 I mentioned earlier. Add to the list the key global supplier of pressure pumping and coiled tubing technologies, which have enabled hydraulic fracture stimulation and the shale revolution; gas pipe conductor connections; thermal desorption technologies to clean up drill cuttings for safe disposal; RFID technologies to track a myriad of assets used by this industry; flexible pipe systems for subsea developments; water desalination, de-oiling and sand separation technologies; real composite pipe for flow lines; bits, drill pipe and top drives used to set a world record on an extended-reach well exceeding 8 miles a few weeks ago; permanent magnet advancements for rotating equipment. Although the industry is still in the early innings of upgrading to AC electronic-controlled rigs, we are at work designing the next generation of drilling rigs, and we will be there with new and better technology for the inevitable upturn.  
We continue to invest in technology and new products to grow organically, and we will continue to pursue interesting acquisitions in this environment, making sure that we are very disciplined about valuations in view of the current market challenges. We closed 2 transactions so far in 2015 and has several more negotiations underway. We have also retired 10% of our shares outstanding through the past several months, given our stock price downturn, because we view it as an extraordinary opportunity to reduce our cost of capital in a historically low interest rate environment. 
Our debt increased $1.1 billion as a result, but with our $3 billion cash balance, net debt is still only $1.2 billion, about 6% of capitalization. I will note, too, that we are currently slowing our share repurchases in view of some potential acquisition candidates coming into sharper focus. 
I am proud of the leadership NOV employees provide in this endeavor. While the current market is very tough, we are well positioned with strong financial and operating resources and an industry-leading installed base of complex equipment in need of continuing close OEM aftermarket support. I am grateful to all of the great NOV employees who are remaining focused on taking care of our customers through this difficult time. 
We announced last week that our CFO, Jeremy Thigpen, has left us to become CEO at one of our important offshore drilling customers, Transocean Ltd. We appreciate Jeremy's leadership through 18 years of service here in both finance and operations, and we wish him and Transocean the very best. Our very talented Chief Accounting Officer, Scott Duff, has agreed to serve as interim CFO as we conduct a search process for our next CFO. And our long-serving Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations, Loren Singletary, here with me today, will pinch-hit on today's call to step us through the detailed financial results by segment. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Loren."
31900,286151112,795774,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to execute on our backlog, completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in t",3008,"Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to execute on our backlog, completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in the quarter. 
Operating profit for the segment was $488 million, yielding an operating margin of 19.3%, down 70 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. EBITDA was $511 million or 20.3% of sales. Q4 to Q1 offshore revenues, which represent 75% of the segment total, declined slightly, and land revenues, which represent 25% of the segment total, remained flat. Segment margins fell slightly as bad debt accruals more than offset cost reduction efforts in the quarter. 
Now let's discuss capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco's Rig Systems. In the first quarter, we received $263 million in new orders and recognized $2.25 billion of revenue out of backlog and an FX adjustment of $99 million, resulting in a book-to-bill 0.11x and a quarter-ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. As Clay mentioned earlier, orders were half of what they were in Q4, and Q1 was one of the first quarters in recent history where land bookings outweighed offshore bookings. Of the total $10.4 billion in backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As we move into the second quarter of 2015, Clay noted that the NOV Rig Systems revenues will decline as much as 30%. We expect revenue out of backlog to slow to the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from Q1's $2.25 billion as we shift fewer land rigs and see the impact of accommodating certain customers-requested delivery modifications for offshore new-builds. We believe margins will decline into the mid-teens percentage from 19.3% in the first quarter. Our goal is working with our customers on these scheduled modifications -- scheduling modifications to maximize the margins on contracts we have in hand and to maintain our core team capable of exceptional performance. This is the right thing to do for our franchise and for our shareholders.  
As we have noted many times before, NOV and our shipyard partners have been extremely busy scaling to large numbers of offshore floating new-build projects through the past few years, most with build schedules of less than 3 years, which is a considerably faster pace than the 4-year-plus delivery schedules that characterized orders from 2005 through 2008. This shift has resulted in higher cost from a supply chain and NOV infrastructure strained to accommodate these more aggressive delivery schedules. Our record results of 2014 to meet these demanding deliveries drove up overtime and air freight and extended our supply chain past optimal cost. Spreading the work out now to later quarters gives us time to manage our supply chain cost down to achieve lower pricing from our vendors, to avoid excess overtime cost and to tackle these projects with our core team in a more efficient, more measured way. And as Clay noted, it helps our customers cope with their stacking cost on certain uncontracted rigs. 
Our revenue recognition out of backlog will likely be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the next few quarters, and we expect total segment revenues for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.8 billion. 
Our outlook for further offshore new-builds remains for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we do expect to see some orders for offshore capital equipment as our customers seek efficiency-driven upgrades and spare parts to support their existing rig fleets and SPS activities that will occur. On land, we expect to see continued demand for Tier 1 AC-driven land rigs in international markets, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. Given our outlook, we are aggressively managing costs down on all fronts. 
National Oilwell Varco aftermarkets generated revenues of $719 million in the first quarter of 2015, down 15% sequentially and down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Revenues fell harder than anticipated as a precipitous decline in land rig activity and stacking of relatively younger rigs negatively impacted demand across the aftermarket business. Operating profit for the segment was $199 million, resulting in operating margins of 27.7%, down 110 basis points sequentially but up 220 basis points year-over-year. Decremental margins were 35%, and EBITDA was $206 million or 28.7% of sales. 
While there is some seasonality in the first quarter revenues for aftermarket, the sequential decline was driven primarily by depressed activity levels. Uncertainty in the marketplace led to our customers' reduced spending and consuming existing inventories, cannibalizing existing idle rigs, postpone repair and upgrade work while they watch and waited, like us, for signs of market normalization. Margins contracted on a reduced volume and the discounts made in selected areas to maintain existing customer relationships. 
Land represented an increased percentage of total segment revenues, up from 20% in the fourth quarter to 25% in the first, driven by higher activity in Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, we recently expanded our service and repair facilities to align more closely with our customers' operation, including 2 new facilities in the United States to support activity in the Permian and the Marcellus. As we move into the second quarter, we believe National Oilwell Varco aftermarket revenues are stable and will remain flattish, with a slight increase in spare parts and rising SPS work offset by rising discounting pressures. Revenues from SPS activities, which occur on a 5-year basis, have become much harder to time as some likely candidates for survey work are stacked or retired amidst the challenging offshore market condition. But nevertheless, our SPS project count is set to grow in the second quarter. 
Operating margins will remain under pressure and may decline slightly from Q1's 27.7% for several reasons. In the second quarter, we will see the full effect of discounts we made from key customers in the first quarter, mostly in repair and services and competitive drilling expendables, and we anticipate our customers to choose lower-margin repair work over refurbishment programs, preferring to do the minimum required for maintenance versus large SPSs. Our longer-term outlook for this group remains very bright, owing to the significant upgrade in rig technology work in newer, more modern fleets with higher mix of NOV equipment and much larger installed base, which carries a pressing need for greater OEM aftermarket support. 
For the first quarter of 2015, National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $1.2 billion, down 23% sequentially and 8% compared to first quarter of 2014, reflecting drilling activity declines. Operating profit for the segment was $124 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.6%, down 750 basis points sequentially and 690 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Sequential decrementals were 42.5%, which were slightly better than anticipated, owing to swift cost-reduction efforts across the board. EBITDA for the segment was $229 million or 19.6% of revenue. 
NOV Wellbore Technologies carries a disproportionately large amount of the company's total $190 million D&A load due to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, manufacturing and service facility infrastructure and a sizable rental fleet in 2 of the segment's larger business units. Drilling activity drives NOV Wellbore Technologies. Though drilling activity has not completely abated, average global rig count fell 25% from the fourth quarter average. 
National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies may be a global business, but it has a significant exposure to North America, where rig count declines were the most severe. In the first quarter, U.S. rig count activity fell by nearly 800 rigs, declining 66 rigs per week on average. In 2008 and '09, during the financial crisis, the pace of rig count declines averaged 55 rigs per week at its deepest point. In Canada, unseasonably early breakup meant rig count was down 40% below the previous year. Our largest businesses were some of the most affected by the depressed activity levels, namely downhole tools, bits, motors, drill pipe and solids control and waste management equipment. And in the current environment, our customers are pressing hard for discounts and are committed to preserving our market leading -- and we are committed to preserving our market-leading positions during the downturn. 
We are currently experiencing the fastest rig -- land rig count -- U.S. land rig count decline in 20 years, and the outlook remains tenuous. Looking into the second quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies will be down mid-teens percentage from $1.2 billion on lower activity levels, and margins could decline to mid-single digits from 10.6%, with mid-40% decrementals, similar to the first quarter sequential average. 
Fewer rigs drilling fewer wells imply less demand for Wellbore Technologies tools and services. Where there is demand, competition will be high and pricing pressure will be very fierce. We are actively reducing cost across the segment to reflect reduced activity levels. But cost reductions lab -- lag revenue declines as we rightsize service and manufacturing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the cost reduction measures we are taking will better position us when the market does turn. 
In today's lower commodity price environment, our customers remain focused on improving economic and drilling efficiencies. At NOV, we are developing new technologies that will help them achieve their goals, such as tectonic drill bits, which we are introducing at next week's OTC; new proprietary threads on drill pipe; and closed-loop drilling automation systems. We continue to believe that new products are the lifeblood of any technology company, and we are proud to say that even in today's down market, our new technologies are gaining traction. And we will continue to innovate on next-generation technologies. 
National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $948 million for the first quarter of 2015, down 28% sequentially and 5% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $108 million, resulting in an operating margin of 11.4%, down 480 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 28%, and first quarter EBITDA for the segment was $163 million or 17.2% of sales. 
Q4 to Q1 demand declined almost equally for both shorter-cycle activity-driven revenues and revenues from backlog. Declines were primarily driven by nearly 40% reduction in revenues for higher-margin offshore completion equipment as strong fourth quarter deliveries did not repeat in the first quarter and North American completion activity slowed. Segment revenues related to production, both on land and offshore, were also negatively impacted by the reduced E&P spending. 
Now let's discuss our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions. In the first quarter, we received $327 million in new orders and recognized $563 million of revenue out of backlog, along with an $81 million FX adjustment, resulting in a book to bill of 0.58x and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.5 billion, down 18% sequentially. Orders were down 30% from the 600 -- -- $469 million won in Q4, although orders for composite pipe processing technologies showed relative strength in the quarter. Of the total $1.5 billion backlog, approximately 69% is offshore and 82% is international. 
As we move into the second quarter, we believe revenues will tick down slightly from $948 million recognized in the first quarter. We expect revenue out of backlog will be in the range of plus or minus $500 million. Given the current market uncertainty, we anticipate reduced demand and increased pricing pressure for equipment and technologies across the segment, which will reduce margins into the high single digits, which implies low 20% decremental margins. As in other segments, we are actively reducing cost in the NOV Completion & Production Solutions to reflect lower levels of activity. 
Our order outlook for onshore completion equipment remains soft, particularly for the North American pressure pumping market as customers struggle with low utilization of existing equipment. We see customers cannibalizing spare parts and using existing stock whenever possible, but expect demand for repair and maintenance to return well in advance of orders for full frac spreads and coiled tubing units. By nature, the FPSO-related bookings are uneven quarter-to-quarter. In today's lower commodity price environment, we expect orders to slow as customers recalibrate cost for offshore production projects, although FEED-related activities and interest in pre-salt work continues. 
Now let's discuss our financials statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the first quarter of 2015, you will see across that gross margin declined 270 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year to 24.4%. SG&A decreased 8% or $42 million sequentially as we continue to make efforts to reduce costs across all business segments. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was up 90 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%. Other items were $122 million in the quarter due to charges related to our early-retirement plans. 
Interest expense and interest income were flat sequentially at $26 million and $5 million, respectively. As compared to 2014, interest expense remained $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to -- from $4 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV decreased $7 million sequentially to $9 million as demand for casing and drill pipe and therefore, green tube, moderated. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, equity income slightly decreased by $1 million. For the second quarter and full year 2015, we believe year-over-year equity income will continue to fall as demand for casing and drill pipe decreases. 
Other expenses for the quarter was $56 million, which represented a $36 million delta sequentially primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currencies and write-offs. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.6%, which was an additional 9.5% over the 28.1% rate that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been 28.9%. We believe that a 30% to 31% effective tax rate for NOV continues to be a realistic estimate for the remainder of 2015.  
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you will see that eliminations were $541 million for the quarter, down slightly from $556 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $227 million in the quarter, down $2 million sequentially on lower volume of intersegment revenues. And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you'll see that depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $190 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1 million from the prior year. EBITDA for the first quarter excluding other items was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our March 31, 2015, balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $5.8 billion, up $355 million or 6.6% sequentially. Several factors contributed to the increase, and we expect working capital to convert to cash and begin to fall later in the year. The largest impact stems from our net of cost in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost and customer prepayments, which together make up the level of customer financing of our working capital and are tied to prepayments and progress billings. As orders have declined, downpayments have declined, and our progress on projects is outpacing our progress payments, which we saw in the previous downturn of 2009 and which will continue for the next few quarters. Working capital impact of this was $425 million in the first quarter. 
Offsetting items include our accounts receivable, which decreased $392 million or 9% sequentially due to lower revenues. Inventory increased $97 million or 1.8% sequentially, mostly due to the transfer of certain short-lived downhole rental tools from PP&E into inventory. While inventory is declining across most businesses, others still receive -- are still receiving components ordered into construction schedules, so we expect inventory to begin to decline later in the year as we adjust our supply chain. We also had some customers postponing receipt of orders due to market conditions which should turnaround in this quarter. Also, leading to a sequential increase in working capital, accounts payable, account -- accrued compensation and accrued liabilities decreased $419 million, which they do every year in the first quarter. 
For the quarter, the company generated $114 million in cash flow from operation. Capital spending for the first quarter was $130 million, down 44% sequentially. In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $85 million and we spent $1.33 billion to repurchase 24.5 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion in share repurchases under our $3 billion authorization. To fund the share repurchases, we -- in the quarter, we borrowed $1.1 billion using our commercial paper program, which increased total debt to $4.2 billion and our net debt to capitalization to a very manageable 6.4%. As a result, we ended the first quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $3 billion, down $512 million sequentially. Of that $3 billion in cash, almost 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at March 31, 2015. 
In summary, we saw spending and orders slow in all areas of the business as lower commodity price drove down E&P capital spending and drilling activity, and we have a challenging quarter ahead as we see the full impact of reduced activity levels and pricing pressures on our business. As an industry, we are actively reducing costs throughout the supply chain as we seek new levels of efficiency. While it is early and uncertain, we are encouraged as rig count declines begin to slow and we get closer to trough levels. 
Deflationary costs may entice improved levels of activity, and as our industry improves from a contraction mode to an expansion mode, NOV will start to see the full effect of the cost-reduction efforts we are making today. Our continued investment in technologies, capacity and aftermarket support had made us the oilfield's preferred equipment and technology provider. And as we pivot to new opportunities, we expect National Oilwell to emerge a stronger, more resilient and more dependable partner for our customers. 
With that, we'd like to open up for questions."

Great question, Marshall, and something we're obviously continuing to think about here. We benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade and have been a big participant in that. And we've also done a lot -- we've been",530,"Yes. Great question, Marshall, and something we're obviously continuing to think about here. We benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade and have been a big participant in that. And we've also done a lot -- we've been very transactional. We have invested a lot of M&A capital through the last decade. When we look back to the past 10 years, 97% of our M&A capital have gone into our other 3 segments, really away from the rig-building space, building out really interesting positions, trying to position us for option value across multiple trends underway. So when we look at, for instance, a shale well drilling operation, what you see out there is a Tier 1 rig, a premium drill pipe, downhole tools, mud motors. You see on the completion side, coiled tubing units and coiled tubing, frac spreads, sanders, mixing units. Basically, all of the picks and shovels, all of the hardware that go into the unconventional shale trend, NOV is a global leading provider of. We look across oilfield and we see opportunities in waste management, and so things like thermal desorption technology to clean up drill cuttings, water management opportunities. We've got some great technologies around osmosis, cleanup and desalinization of water, de-oiling of water with our Waterwolf products. So we're doing more on the production side. So this has been a -- we've had a steady application of capital into other trends. Recognizing that this industry always changes, and over the past few years, of course, the big change are the shales have emerged as a much lower marginal cost source of oil and the deepwater had some challenges. But I also know, from cycle to cycle, marginal costs will rearrange themselves. There's a lot of smart people in this industry focused on their particular resource base. And with regards to the deepwater, I think, certainly, the marginal costs out there coming down, and NOV plans on being a part of that. So when it comes to building FPSO vessels, the industry has been challenged. We think we've got some great ideas to apply there to bring costs down. The owners of the deepwater reservoirs are experiencing much lower drilling costs with the deflation that's going on in the drilling space. And these joint ventures that you've heard about that are really focused on subsea processes, I think you're going to have a great benefit to. There's a lot of hay to be made here with reducing back pressures on reservoirs, subsea lifting, subsea separation. And I think you kind of add all that up and marginal cost for deepwater reserves are going to come down. What we try to do at NOV is to position ourselves across these various trends and really sort of maximize option value in the participation of all these trends. So looking forward, we see great opportunity as all participants try to reduce their marginal cost. We also see a lot more NOV equipment out there that's going to need a lot more aftermarket support, and we've been investing in that footprint globally and are going to be there to take care of those rigs."

We talked very explicitly at our Analyst Day about basing our strategic plans on a generational look at oil and gas supply, which the ExxonMobil outlook 2040 is. And certainly -- but the other thing we highlighted at that conference, if you remember, Kurt, is the fact that we go through cyclical downturns, and so this is not -- where we are today is not a surprise to us. I think the challenge for management is to make sure we're going to get through this and continuing to work on long-term strategic plans and execute our long-term vision, which is still very, very exciting. The -- with regards to the offshore, like I mentioned earlier, all sources of crude are continually working on reducing their marginal costs, slide down that marginal cost curve and not be the last barrel produced in terms of economic efficiency. And the offshore is absolutely no exception. And so what's encouraging about what we see today is that -- at $100 a barrel, there's not as much incentive to do things differently. When oil price drops to $50 a barrel and the IOCs have found, for instance, 5 billion barrels in the lower tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a strong incentive to figure out. They know the resource base is there. How do we figure out how to produce that at lower cost? And they've got the extra tailwind of drilling process deflation. Pricing is dropping for services on drilling those wells, on the rigs required, the day rates around the rigs required to drill those wells. And so it's a pretty good backdrop to do things differently, and there's a lot of active and constructive participation from our customers around that. We will bring the marginal cost down on subsea barrels."

I will tell you specifically where we've been deploying capital the last couple of years has really enhanced our aftermarket business, in particular, around rig. The rising installed base of NOV equipment and technology out there is pretty transparent to you and everybody, and so what we see are a lot more NOV rigs running and a lot more customers in need of close OEM support. And what we find is these great little businesses that we can acquire. In fact, 2 weeks ago, I was touring one that we bought in West Africa, for instance -- South Africa. That's been a great addition and great reputation, and what we've been able to bring to that business is kind of the NOV global reach and scale. And so that's been a great help for our customers in that region. But around the world, all of our customers want us to be closer to goal phase, closer to their rigs for aftermarket support. So that's an interesting area, and that's part of the reason, at our Analyst Day, we said, ""Hey, growth prospects for Rig Aftermarket long term are terrific, and we're putting capital behind that."" In other businesses, again, we've got opportunities to grow those, expand their footprint, and so kind of a similar pattern."

This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015.",3436,"Thank you, Loren, and welcome, everyone, to version 2.0 of National Oilwell Varco's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. 
This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015. Excluding charges related to a voluntary retirement program, the write-down of Venezuela assets and a discrete nonrecurring foreign tax exposure; fully diluted earnings per share were $1.14, down 33% sequentially, down 12% year-over-year excluding other items from all quarters. Revenues were $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015, down 16% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. 
Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $692 million or 14.4% of sales in the first quarter. Decremental operating leverage was 37% sequentially. First quarter EBITDA excluding charges was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. This compares to $1.2 billion in the prior quarter and $1 billion in the first quarter of last year excluding other items from all periods. 
Business in the first quarter of 2015 declined significantly in response to lower oil prices. We entered 2015 with oil prices half of what they were just a few short months ago. Now all commodity prices signal producers to add or diminish supply, and oil is no exception. So in the first quarter, with global supplies outpacing global demand by 1.5 million barrels per day, the oil price signal rolled through our industry like thunder, and thunderstruck participants responded vigorously. Spending is falling in almost all regions, driving the worldwide rig count down by 1/3 since September. The rate of decline of active rigs most acute in -- across North America is breathtaking and unequaled in prior downturns. 
NOV saw activities and orders slow in just about all areas of our business, and all of our units are experiencing pricing pressure. Most of us in oilfield -- in the oil and gas industry have been through downturns many times before and have honed our skills at rapidly adjusting spending through the cycles. So following record results for National Oilwell Varco in the fourth quarter of 2014, our revenue declined 16% in Q1 and is expected to decline further for at least the next few quarters. 
There's been much debate as to the shape and timing of the eventual oil price recovery. We don't know if we are in for a V-shaped or a U-shaped or a W-shaped recovery, but we will all know soon because the industry is conducting its first grand global empirical test of price elasticity of the supply of oil. What we do know is that North American oil shales are emerging as the new swing source of oil. Since 2011, in a $100 per barrel price environment, North American oil shales grew about 4.5 million barrels per day while the rest of the world posted a 0.5 million barrel per day production decline. 
We know individual shale wells decline exceedingly quickly, 8 to 10x the rate of conventional resources. We know that the sharp and rapid decline and the addition of fresh and new producing wells of all kinds will result in diminished global oil production over time. We also know that the excess productive capacity around the world, the oversupply, is, thankfully, just a few percent, far less than my first downturn of the 1980s. We also know that global economic activity, which drives oil demand, is not strong and that lower oil prices will act as an economic stimulus to many economies. 
The facts as we know them point to a pretty good foundation for an eventual recovery. All wells, all fields and all basins left wanting for investment inevitably decline. And economies need more energy to grow, so demand for oil will grow, driven by the engine of people desiring a better standard of living. Eventually, supply and demand curves will cross and we will see oil prices signaling producers to get back to production growth. We just don't know when, and frankly, we can't wait for the eventual recovery. 
Therefore, 2015 will be a year for restructuring at NOV. Given our short-term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach will be to focus on costs without sacrificing our long-term opportunities. We are managing our infrastructure to the market, reducing costs as utilization levels permit. This began in earnest in the first quarter when we reduced SG&A 8%, coming off exceedingly high levels of utilization last year. We started with a voluntary early-retirement program for our long-serving employees, and this is being followed by reductions in facilities as workforce -- and workforce as utilization dictates. 
We are working to in-source more of our production needs as utilization declines across our manufacturing plants, with a goal of preserving as much work as possible for our plants and our teams. We expect to pull in about 650,000 machining hours from our vendors this year and another 600,000 machining hours next year in our Rig Systems segment, for example, and comparable efforts are underway in Wellbore Technologies and the other segments as well. 
While reductions in contract labor, overtime and shifts help mitigate decrementals, we will face underabsorption overall. We are also under pricing pressure and request to cancel work, which we are vigorously opposing. We are seeking to structure discounts around volume-related rebates tied to payments and expanded product purchases, in effect, picking our points to try and win greater share, defend volumes and improve absorption in our plants. We don't want our customers to get out of the habit of buying from us, to maximize our market position when the inevitable recovery comes. 
This downturn is an opportunity to become better. We have long focused on operational excellence, continuing -- continually evolving to utilize modern techniques to be the best manufacturer. This downturn will drive us to improve efficiency in a supply chain straining, through the last decade, to accommodate extraordinarily high demands from our customers. Through the last decade, NOV responded with an exceptional level of effectiveness to a macrocycle upgrade to the fleet of equipment the industry relies on. The next challenge for us is to retrench and transform, to pivot to new opportunities that are emerging and to continue to lead the industry. To that end, we will continue to invest in numerous long-term growth opportunities to execute our long-term strategic plan. 
Technology and equipment have transformed our industry to enable accessing new frontiers like deepwater and to access new sources of hydrocarbons from poor-quality reservoir rocks like shales. NOV's DNA is to continue to apply purposeful innovation to continually expand the opportunity set of attractive investments for our customers. 
This is a tough market with tough challenges, but they are not new to us. 
Given the difficult oil price backdrop, our first quarter orders were weak for our Rig Systems segment. We booked orders of $236 million, half of what we booked in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also booked a $99 million adjustment to our FX -- to our backlog related to FX related to contracts denominated in foreign currencies. Since the costs associated with these are also denominated in those same foreign currencies, there is no margin impact -- percentage impact, only a revenue impact. 
Shipments out of backlog totaled $2.25 billion, yielding an ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. The quarter included 2 jack-up packages and a handful of land rigs mostly targeting Middle East and Latin America markets. 
Our outlook for orders for the second quarter is marginally better, but will remain slow as customers who need equipment are taking their time ordering. Areas of comparative strength are seen in platform rigs, fleet spares, components and software upgrades to improve tripping efficiency offshore, think Iron Roughnecks and handling tools, and BOPs, land rigs and well service rigs for Latin America and the Middle East. 
We continue to see growth in SPS projects despite some being postponed, some rigs being stacked or retired, which had planned SPSs, and other senior scope reduced. We believe contractors are seeking to differentiate the efficiency of their offshore rigs in a crowded marketplace, and this will shape our near-term offshore rig orders and that a desire for Tier 1 AC land rigs in international markets will characterize the next few quarters for land demand. We also expect many more offshore rig retirements in addition to the 30-plus already announced, which will speed the inevitable fleet high-grading process and bring offshore rig supply/demand into better balance. 
Many of our North American land customers indicate they want to pursue upgrading their fleets to Tier 1 in advance of a potential 2016 recovery. In the short run though, we expect continued soft orders as contractors struggle with lower day rates, cannibalized components off of stacked rigs in lieu of placing new orders with NOV. Installation and commissioning activity around our existing offshore new-build backlog remains very high. However, in several instances, we and the shipyards are working with the drilling contractors to delay rig deliveries. This helps the drilling contractors postpone stacking costs on uncontracted new-build deliveries, and it will help us manage supply chain, freight and installation and commissioning costs more effectively and level load across our operations. 
We are also curtailing activity related to our Brazilian rigs, which I'll speak to more in just a moment. As a consequence, we are, in effect, shifting offshore revenue out of backlog into subsequent quarters. This will impact our near-term Rig Systems segment revenue forecast. Near-term total revenues for the Rig Systems segment will decline significantly in the second quarter due to this effect as well as the expectation of lower revenues associated with land rig shipments in the second quarter. We expect second quarter revenues for this segment to be in the range of about $1.8 billion, down about 30% sequentially. 
Within our backlog at March 31 are orders for 22 drilling equipment packages for floating rigs for Brazil totaling $3.3 billion. At the time of our last call, the ultimate customer for these rigs, a financing vehicle 10% owned by Petrobras, called Sete, was within a day or 2 of securing long-term financing to get current on payments to the Brazilian shipyards building these rigs, which are NOV's contractual customers. Unfortunately, the corruption scandal in Brazil was linked to Sete just prior to signing, which resulted in the banks backing away from the proposed financing package then on the table. 
Since then, our Brazilian shipyard customers have come under significant financial stress due to a lack of payments from Sete. Currently, we understand that the banks and the shareholders have granted Sete a 90-day window to seek a solution to its financing struggles, and we know that there is an intense level of activity around securing permanent financing solution involving several banks. 
The origin of the rig-building program in Brazil arises from public-policy goals set forth by the government to foster a local oil field services and shipyard industry to employ more Brazilians, and thus far, Petrobras remains contractually committed to employing these locally built rigs once they are completed. There are specific requirements within the lease concessions for pre-salt blocks granted to Petrobras by the Brazilian government, which require local content ranging from 37% to 55%. 
According to the Brazilian press, these local content requirements have created over 120,000 jobs in the country. We, therefore, continue to believe that there is considerable political pressure in Brazil to ultimately get these rigs built. We believe these rigs will eventually get built. We are engaged with our shipyard customers in Brazil, however, to adjust manufacturing schedules for the now delayed programs and are slowing activity pending payment. Our contracts are still in place, and the downpayments and progress billings we have achieved thus far exceed our investment as per our contracts. One of the 4 shipyards we are working for has continued to pay us due to their Asian partners stepping in to finance operations there. 
During the first quarter, we recognized $172 million in revenues associated with the program, about 7% of total segment revenues, but this will slow substantially for at least the next couple of quarters, contributing to our lower guidance for Rig Systems' Q2 revenues. And apart from the derricks on these rigs, the components we have built in WIP are marketable in the event of ultimate default, which we still consider unlikely. Overall, we remain confident in the eventual monetization of our existing contractual Rig Systems backlog both in Brazil and elsewhere and are working with customers to modify schedules to accommodate the challenges they are facing and to ease the stress on our supply chain. 
Turning to our other segments. Revenues from Rig Aftermarket fell 15% sequentially, more than we expected as drilling contractors curtailed expenditure sharply, much more than we anticipated. We typically see the first several weeks of the year slow seasonally as contractors set budgets and then see spare parts orders and repair services pick up in March as contractors begin work under their new annual budgets. However, this year, the market pickup never came and April has remained soft. 
We expect flattish sequential revenues in the second quarter, with rising SPS work and relatively strong demand in the Middle East offset by mounting price pressure on repair, services and drilling expendables, which will drive margins lower by a couple of hundred basis points. Our strategy within Rig Aftermarket is unchanged: to capitalize on our leading and growing installed base of NOV equipment to provide OEM support close to our customers' rigs. 
The Wellbore Technologies segment declined 23% sequentially, with all major business units posting declines and significant price pressure tied to drilling activity. Drill pipe sales declined the most, coming off an exceptional fourth quarter, which was near a record, and orders for drill pipe slowed to a trickle in the first quarter as most operators are cannibalizing pipe from idle rigs in lieu of buying new pipe. Looking into the second quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies to decline in the double-digit percentage range at high decremental margins as discounting continues to outpace the speed of our cost reductions. 
One bright spot within Wellbore Technologies is our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe unit and new closed-loop drilling automation services through our dynamic drilling solutions business unit that continue to attract operator interest through demonstrated reductions in drilling times. We are very excited about the potential of this technology to transform drilling efficiency and materially improve E&P drilling economics in shales, in the deepwater and in other basins around the globe. 
Completion & Production Solutions segment revenues declined 28% sequentially at 28% decremental margins as most products within this group saw sliding demand. Our backlog for Completion & Production Solutions segment declined 18% during the first quarter as net new orders of $327 million were offset by revenues out of backlog of $563 million and an FX adjustment of $81 million. Demand for composite pipe and process and flow products saw book-to-bill levels close to 1 in the first quarter, but we saw sharp declines in pressure pumping equipment demand. Orders for flexibles and FPSO products also fell short of revenues out of backlog.  Ending backlog for the first quarter was $1.46 billion. 
We are pleased that our FPSO turret business achieved record revenue levels in the first quarter, with great progress on existing projects. Interest by IOCs and NOCs in our FPSO strategy has risen considerably through the past few quarters as operators are actively seeking to pioneer new ways of constructing these complex vessels to achieve on-time, on-budget deliveries and ultimately improve development economics. The industry appears to be latching onto our standardization and modular construction thesis, recognizing that we must do things differently to develop the billions of barrels that have been discovered in the deepwater. 
""Design 1, build 2"" is a great idea. We are engaged on a dozen or so projects, but project awards are going slowly as most are conducting extended FEED studies to reengineer and recalibrate costs and waiting for deflation in the supply chains. We continue to believe that NOV's extensive experience in managing complex equipment, vessel integration projects and shipyards positions us well to pioneer a better way in FPSO construction. 
As we expected, our pressure pumping product sales fell sharply during the first quarter as customers delayed picking up their orders and pressed hard for pricing concessions. We closed 3 facilities within the unit during the first quarter and continue to reduce costs within our supply chain. North America was hit hardest, but the Middle East and other international markets were more stable, a recurring theme through many of our businesses. Looking to the second quarter, we expect revenues to decline a few percentage points but margins to fall further as the full force of discounting kicks in. 
Obviously, our second quarter outlook across all our segments is very guarded, and our situation is fluid. While we face a difficult market near term, we will be looking for revenues to stabilize across Rig Aftermarket, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions in the second half of the year, and we will manage Rig Systems to the backlog and work available in the marketplace. The significant drilling cost deflation underway will benefit producers. A modest oil price rebound, coupled with lower drilling costs, may bring about some green shoots of activity in the second half, and we'll be watching closely. But as I said, we plan to manage to whatever size the market is across all of our businesses quarter by quarter. 
Prior downturns in our industry have provided great opportunity for those with capital and foresight to look through near-term adversity. NOV is a remarkable franchise. We are also at the forefront of several transformative trends in the oil business. Closed-loop drilling automation and FPSO supply chain management are 2 I mentioned earlier. Add to the list the key global supplier of pressure pumping and coiled tubing technologies, which have enabled hydraulic fracture stimulation and the shale revolution; gas pipe conductor connections; thermal desorption technologies to clean up drill cuttings for safe disposal; RFID technologies to track a myriad of assets used by this industry; flexible pipe systems for subsea developments; water desalination, de-oiling and sand separation technologies; real composite pipe for flow lines; bits, drill pipe and top drives used to set a world record on an extended-reach well exceeding 8 miles a few weeks ago; permanent magnet advancements for rotating equipment. Although the industry is still in the early innings of upgrading to AC electronic-controlled rigs, we are at work designing the next generation of drilling rigs, and we will be there with new and better technology for the inevitable upturn.  
We continue to invest in technology and new products to grow organically, and we will continue to pursue interesting acquisitions in this environment, making sure that we are very disciplined about valuations in view of the current market challenges. We closed 2 transactions so far in 2015 and have several more negotiations underway. We have also retired 10% of our shares outstanding through the past several months, given our stock price downturn, because we view it as an extraordinary opportunity to reduce our cost of capital in a historically low interest rate environment. 
Our debt increased $1.1 billion as a result, but with our $3 billion cash balance, net debt is still only $1.2 billion, about 6% of capitalization. I will note, too, that we are currently slowing our share repurchases in view of some potential acquisition candidates coming into sharper focus. 
I am proud of the leadership NOV employees provide in this endeavor. While the current market is very tough, we are well positioned with strong financial and operating resources and an industry-leading installed base of complex equipment in need of continuing close OEM aftermarket support. I am grateful to all of the great NOV employees who are remaining focused on taking care of our customers through this difficult time. 
We announced last week that our CFO, Jeremy Thigpen, has left us to become CEO at one of our important offshore drilling customers, Transocean Ltd. We appreciate Jeremy's leadership through 18 years of service here in both finance and operations, and we wish him and Transocean the very best. Our very talented Chief Accounting Officer, Scott Duff, has agreed to serve as interim CFO as we conduct a search process for our next CFO. And our long-serving Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations, Loren Singletary, here with me today, will pinch-hit on today's call to step us through the detailed financial results by segment. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Loren."
31900,286151112,795962,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to execute on our backlog, completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in t",3014,"Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to execute on our backlog, completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in the quarter. 
Operating profit for the segment was $488 million, yielding an operating margin of 19.3%, down 70 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. EBITDA was $511 million or 20.3% of sales. Q4 to Q1 offshore revenues, which represent 75% of the segment total, declined slightly, and land revenues, which represent 25% of the segment total, remained flat. Segment margins fell slightly as bad debt accruals more than offset cost reduction efforts in the quarter. 
Now let's discuss capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco's Rig Systems. In the first quarter, we received $263 million in new orders and recognized $2.25 billion of revenue out of backlog and an FX adjustment of $99 million, resulting in a book-to-bill 0.11x and a quarter-ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. As Clay mentioned earlier, orders were half of what they were in Q4, and Q1 was one of the first quarters in recent history where land bookings outweighed offshore bookings. Of the total $10.4 billion in backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As we move into the second quarter of 2015, Clay noted that the NOV Rig Systems revenues will decline as much as 30%. We expect revenue out of backlog to slow to the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from Q1's $2.25 billion as we shift fewer land rigs and see the impact of accommodating certain customers-requested delivery modifications for offshore new-builds. We believe margins will decline into the mid-teens percentage from 19.3% in the first quarter. Our goal is working with our customers on these scheduled modifications -- scheduling modifications to maximize the margins on contracts we have in hand and to maintain our core team capable of exceptional performance. This is the right thing to do for our franchise and for our shareholders.  
As we have noted many times before, NOV and our shipyard partners have been extremely busy scaling to large numbers of offshore floating new-build projects through the past few years, most with build schedules of less than 3 years, which is a considerably faster pace than the 4-year-plus delivery schedules that characterized orders from 2005 through 2008. This shift has resulted in higher cost from a supply chain and NOV infrastructure strained to accommodate these more aggressive delivery schedules. Our record results of 2014 to meet these demanding deliveries drove up overtime and air freight and extended our supply chain past optimal cost. Spreading the work out now to later quarters gives us time to manage our supply chain cost down, to achieve lower pricing from our vendors, to avoid excess overtime cost and to tackle these projects with our core team in a more efficient, more measured way. And as Clay noted, it helps our customers cope with their stacking cost on certain uncontracted rigs. 
Our revenue recognition out of backlog will likely be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the next few quarters, and we expect total segment revenues for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.8 billion. 
Our outlook for further offshore new-builds remains subdued for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we do expect to see some orders for offshore capital equipment as our customers seek efficiency-driven upgrades and spare parts to support their existing rig fleets and SPS activities that will occur. On land, we expect to see continued demand for Tier 1 AC-driven land rigs in international markets, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. Given our outlook, we are aggressively managing costs down on all fronts. 
National Oilwell Varco aftermarkets generated revenues of $719 million in the first quarter of 2015, down 15% sequentially and down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Revenues fell harder than anticipated as a precipitous decline in land rig activity and stacking of relatively younger rigs negatively impacted demand across the aftermarket business. Operating profit for the segment was $199 million, resulting in operating margins of 27.7%, down 110 basis points sequentially but up 220 basis points year-over-year. Decremental margins were 35%, and EBITDA was $206 million or 28.7% of sales. 
While there is some seasonality in the first quarter revenues for aftermarket, the sequential decline was driven primarily by depressed activity levels. Uncertainty in the marketplace led to our customers' reduced spending and consuming existing inventories, cannibalizing existing idle rigs, postponed repair and upgrade work while they watch and waited, like us, for signs of market normalization. Margins contracted on a reduced volume and the discounts made in selected areas to maintain existing customer relationships. 
Land represented an increased percentage of total segment revenues, up from 20% in the fourth quarter to 25% in the first, driven by higher activity in Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, we recently expanded our service and repair facilities to align more closely with our customers' operation, including 2 new facilities in the United States to support activity in the Permian and the Marcellus. As we move into the second quarter, we believe National Oilwell Varco aftermarket revenues are stable and will remain flattish, with a slight increase in spare parts and rising SPS work offset by rising discounting pressures. Revenues from SPS activities, which occur on a 5-year basis, have become much harder to time as some likely candidates for survey work are stacked or retired amidst the challenging offshore market condition. But nevertheless, our SPS project count is set to grow in the second quarter. 
Operating margins will remain under pressure and may decline slightly from Q1's 27.7% for several reasons. In the second quarter, we will see the full effect of discounts we made from key customers in the first quarter, mostly in repair and services and competitive drilling expendables, and we anticipate our customers to choose lower-margin repair work over refurbishment programs, preferring to do the minimum required for maintenance versus large SPSs. Our longer-term outlook for this group remains very bright, owing to the significant upgrade in rig technology at work in newer, more modern fleets with higher mix of NOV equipment and a much larger installed base, which carries a pressing need for greater OEM aftermarket support. 
For the first quarter of 2015, National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $1.2 billion, down 23% sequentially and 8% compared to first quarter of 2014, reflecting drilling activity declines. Operating profit for the segment was $124 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.6%, down 750 basis points sequentially and 690 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Sequential decrementals were 42.5%, which were slightly better than anticipated, owing to swift cost-reduction efforts across the board. EBITDA for the segment was $229 million or 19.6% of revenue. 
NOV Wellbore Technologies carries a disproportionately large amount of the company's total $190 million D&A load due to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, manufacturing and service facility infrastructure and a sizable rental fleet in 2 of the segment's larger business units. Drilling activity drives NOV Wellbore Technologies. Though drilling activity has not completely abated, average global rig count fell 25% from the fourth quarter average. 
National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies may be a global business, but it has a significant exposure to North America, where rig count declines were the most severe. In the first quarter, U.S. rig count activity fell by nearly 800 rigs, declining 66 rigs per week on average. In 2008 and '09, during the financial crisis, the pace of rig count declines averaged 55 rigs per week at its deepest point. In Canada, unseasonably early breakup meant rig count was down 40% below the previous year. Our largest businesses were some of the most affected by the depressed activity levels, namely downhole tools, bits, motors, drill pipe and solids control and waste management equipment. And in the current environment, our customers are pressing hard for discounts and are committed to preserving our market leading -- and we are committed to preserving our market-leading positions during the downturn. 
We are currently experiencing the fastest rig -- land rig count -- U.S. land rig count decline in 20 years, and the outlook remains tenuous. Looking into the second quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies will be down mid-teens percentage from $1.2 billion on lower activity levels, and margins could decline to mid-single digits from 10.6%, with mid-40% decrementals, similar to the first quarter sequential leverage. 
Fewer rigs drilling fewer wells imply less demand for Wellbore Technologies tools and services. Where there is demand, competition will be high and pricing pressure will be very fierce. We are actively reducing cost across the segment to reflect reduced activity levels. But cost reductions lab -- lag revenue declines as we rightsize service and manufacturing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the cost reduction measures we are taking will better position us when the market does turn. 
In today's lower commodity price environment, our customers remain focused on improving economic and drilling efficiencies. At NOV, we are developing new technologies that will help them achieve their goals, such as tectonic drill bits, which we are introducing at next week's OTC; new proprietary threads on drill pipe; and closed-loop drilling automation systems. We continue to believe that new products are the lifeblood of any technology company, and we are proud to say that even in today's down market, our new technologies are gaining traction. And we will continue to innovate on next-generation technologies. 
National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $948 million for the first quarter of 2015, down 28% sequentially and 5% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $108 million, resulting in an operating margin of 11.4%, down 480 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 28%, and first quarter EBITDA for the segment was $163 million or 17.2% of sales. 
Q4 to Q1 demand declined almost equally for both shorter-cycle activity-driven revenues and revenues from backlog. Declines were primarily driven by a nearly 40% reduction in revenues for higher-margin offshore completion equipment, as strong fourth quarter deliveries did not repeat in the first quarter and North American completion activity slowed. Segment revenues related to production, both on land and offshore, were also negatively impacted by the reduced E&P spending. 
Now let's discuss our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions. In the first quarter, we received $327 million in new orders and recognized $563 million of revenue out of backlog, along with an $81 million FX adjustment, resulting in a book to bill of 0.58x and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.5 billion, down 18% sequentially. Orders were down 30% from the 600 -- -- $469 million won in Q4, although orders for composite pipe processing technologies showed relative strength in the quarter. Of the total $1.5 billion backlog, approximately 69% is offshore and 82% is international. 
As we move into the second quarter, we believe revenues will tick down slightly from $948 million recognized in the first quarter. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of plus or minus $500 million. Given the current market uncertainty, we anticipate reduced demand and increased pricing pressure for equipment and technologies across the segment, which will reduce margins into the high single digits, which implies low 20% decremental margins. As in other segments, we are actively reducing cost in the NOV Completion & Production Solutions to reflect lower levels of activity. 
Our order outlook for onshore completion equipment remains soft, particularly for the North American pressure pumping market as customers struggle with low utilization of existing equipment. We see customers cannibalizing spare parts and using existing stock whenever possible, but expect demand for repair and maintenance to return well in advance of orders for full frac spreads and coiled tubing units. By nature, the FPSO-related bookings are uneven quarter-to-quarter. In today’s lower commodity price environment, we expect orders to slow as customers recalibrate cost for offshore production projects, although FEED-related activities and interest in pre-salt work continues. 
Now let's discuss our financials statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the first quarter of 2015, you will see across -- that gross margin declined 270 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year to 24.4%. SG&A decreased 8% or $42 million sequentially as we continue to make efforts to reduce costs across all business segments. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was up 90 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%. Other items were $122 million in the quarter due to charges related to our early-retirement plans. 
Interest expense and interest income were flat sequentially at $26 million and $5 million, respectively. As compared to 2014, interest expense remained $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to -- from $4 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV decreased $7 million sequentially to $9 million as demand for casing and drill pipe and therefore, green tube, moderated. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, equity income slightly decreased by $1 million. For the second quarter and full year 2015, we believe year-over-year equity income will continue to fall as demand for casing and drill pipe decreases. 
Other expenses for the quarter was $56 million, which represented a $36 million delta sequentially primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currencies and write-offs. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.6%, which was an additional 9.5% over the 28.1% rate that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been 28.9%. We believe that a 30% to 31% effective tax rate for NOV continues to be a realistic estimate for the remainder of 2015.  
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you will see that eliminations were $541 million for the quarter, down slightly from $556 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $227 million in the quarter, down $2 million sequentially on lower volume of intersegment revenues. And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you'll see that depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $190 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1 million from the prior year. EBITDA for the first quarter excluding other items was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our March 31, 2015, balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $5.8 billion, up $355 million or 6.6% sequentially. Several factors contributed to the increase, and we expect working capital to convert to cash and begin to fall later in the year. The largest impact stems from our net of cost in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost and customer prepayments, which together make up the level of customer financing of our working capital and are tied to prepayments and progress billings. As orders have declined, downpayments have declined, and our progress on projects is outpacing our progress payments, which we saw in the previous downturn of 2009 and which will continue for the next few quarters. Working capital impact of this was $425 million in the first quarter. 
Offsetting items include our accounts receivable, which decreased $392 million or 9% sequentially due to lower revenues. Inventory increased $97 million or 1.8% sequentially, mostly due to the transfer of certain short-lived downhole rental tools from PP&E into inventory. While inventory is declining across most businesses, others still receive -- are still receiving components ordered into construction schedules, so we expect inventory to begin to decline later in the year as we adjust our supply chain. We also had some customers postponing receipt of orders due to market conditions which should turn around in this quarter. Also, leading to a sequential increase in working capital, accounts payable, account -- accrued compensation and accrued liabilities decreased $419 million, which they do every year in the first quarter. 
For the quarter, the company generated $114 million in cash flow from operation. Capital spending for the first quarter was $130 million, down 44% sequentially. In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $85 million and we spent $1.33 billion to repurchase 24.5 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion in share repurchases under our $3 billion authorization. To fund the share repurchases, we -- in the quarter, we borrowed $1.1 billion using our commercial paper program, which increased total debt to $4.2 billion and our net debt to capitalization to a very manageable 6.4%. As a result, we ended the first quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $3 billion, down $512 million sequentially. Of that $3 billion in cash, almost 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at March 31, 2015. 
In summary, we saw spending and orders slow in all areas of the business as lower commodity price drove down E&P capital spending and drilling activity, and we have a challenging quarter ahead as we see the full impact of reduced activity levels and pricing pressures on our business. As an industry, we are actively reducing costs throughout the supply chain as we seek new levels of efficiency. While it is early and uncertain, we are encouraged as rig count declines begin to slow and we get closer to trough levels. 
Deflationary costs may entice improved levels of activity, and as our industry improves from a contraction mode to an expansion mode, NOV will start to see the full effect of the cost-reduction efforts we are making today. Our continued investment in technologies, capacity and aftermarket support have made us the oilfield's preferred equipment and technology provider. And as we pivot to new opportunities, we expect National Oilwell to emerge a stronger, more resilient and more dependable partner for our customers. 
With that, we'd like to open up for questions."

Great question, Marshall, and something we're obviously continuing to think about here. We benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade and have been a big participant in that. And we've also done a lot -- we've been",531,"Yes. Great question, Marshall, and something we're obviously continuing to think about here. We benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade and have been a big participant in that. And we've also done a lot -- we've been very transactional. We have invested a lot of M&A capital through the last decade. When we look back to the past 10 years, 97% of our M&A capital have gone into our other 3 segments, really away from the rig-building space, building out really interesting positions, trying to position us for option value across multiple trends underway. So when we look at, for instance, a shale well drilling operation, what you see out there is a Tier 1 rig, a premium drill pipe, downhole tools, mud motors. You see on the completion side, coiled tubing units and coiled tubing, frac spreads, sanders, mixing units. Basically, all of the picks and shovels, all of the hardware that go into the unconventional shale trend, NOV is a global leading provider of. We look across oilfield and we see opportunities in waste management, and so things like thermal desorption technology to clean up drill cuttings, water management opportunities. We've got some great technologies around osmosis, cleanup and desalinization of water, de-oiling of water with our Waterwolf products. So we're doing more on the production side. So this has been a -- we've had a steady application of capital into other trends, recognizing that this industry always changes and over the past few years, of course, the big change are the shales have emerged as a much lower marginal cost source of oil and the deepwater had some challenges. But I also know, from cycle to cycle, marginal costs will rearrange themselves. There's a lot of smart people in this industry focused on their particular resource base. And with regards to the deepwater, I think, certainly, the marginal costs out there are coming down, and NOV plans on being a part of that. So when it comes to building FPSO vessels, the industry has been challenged. We think we've got some great ideas to apply there to bring costs down. The owners of the deepwater reservoirs are experiencing much lower drilling costs with the deflation that's gone on in the drilling space. And these joint ventures that you've heard about that are really focused on subsea processes, I think you're going to have a great benefit too. There's a lot of hay to be made here with reducing back pressures on reservoirs, subsea lifting, subsea separation. And I think you kind of add all that up and marginal cost for deepwater reserves are going to come down. What we try to do at NOV is to position ourselves across these various trends and really sort of maximize option value in the participation of all these trends. So looking forward, we see great opportunity as all participants try to reduce their marginal cost. We also see a lot more NOV equipment out there that's going to need a lot more aftermarket support, and we've been investing in that footprint globally and are going to be there to take care of those rigs."

And certainly -- but the other thing we highlighted at that conference, if you remember, Kurt, is the fact that we go through cyclical downturns, and so this is not -- where we are today is not a surprise to us. I think the challenge for management is to make sure we're looking through this and continuing to work on our long-term strategic plans and execute our long-term vision, which is still very, very exciting. The -- with regards to the offshore, like I mentioned earlier, all sources of crude are continually working on reducing their marginal costs, slide down that marginal cost curve and not be the last barrel produced in terms of economic efficiency and the offshore is absolutely no exception. And so what's encouraging about what we see today is that -- at $100 a barrel, there's not as much incentive to do things differently. When the oil price drops to $50 a barrel and the IOCs have found, for instance, 5 billion barrels in the lower tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a strong incentive to figure out -- they know the resource base is there, how do we figure out how to produce that at lower cost? And they've got the extra tailwind of drilling process deflation. Pricing is dropping for services on drilling those wells, on the rigs required, the day rates around the rigs required to drill those wells. And so it's a pretty good backdrop to do things differently, and there's a lot of active and constructive participation from our customers around that. We will bring the marginal cost down on subsea barrels."

I will tell you specifically where we've been deploying capital the last couple of years has really enhanced our aftermarket business, in particular, around rig. The rising installed base of NOV equipment and technology out there is pretty transparent to you and everybody, and so what we see are a lot more NOV rigs running and a lot more customers in need of close OEM support and what we find is these great little businesses that we can acquire. In fact, 2 weeks ago, I was touring one that we bought in West Africa, for instance -- South Africa, that's been a great addition and great reputation, and what we've been able to bring to that business is kind of the NOV global reach and scale. And so that's been a great help for our customers in that region. But around the world, all of our customers want us to be closer to the coal face, closer to their rigs for aftermarket support. So that's an interesting area, and that's part of the reason, at our Analyst Day, we said, ""Hey, growth prospects for Rig Aftermarket long term are terrific, and we're putting capital behind that."" In other businesses, again, we've got opportunities to grow those, expand their footprint, and so kind of a similar pattern."

This morning, we announced that National Oilwell Varco are on $0.74 per fully diluted share in the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, on a U.S. GAAP basis.

This morning, we announced that National Oilwell Varco are on $0.74 per fully diluted share in the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding $17 million in pretax charges or $0.03 per share after tax, related to severance of facilities closures, earnings were $0.77 per fully diluted share, down 32% sequentially from the first quarter of 2015 and down 48% from the second quarter of 2014, excluding other items from all periods. 
Revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, down 19% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $455 million or 11.6% of sales in the second quarter. Decremental operational leverage was 26% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. EBITDA, excluding charges in the second quarter, was $627 million or 16% of sales, down 25% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year. Almost all of our business units posted lower sequential sales due to lower oil prices or activity around the globe with only a few areas like Argentina and the Middle East bucking the trend. We also felt a full quarter effect of customer discounts implemented during the first quarter along with cost absorption challenges in manufacturing facilities. Generally, we still see some pricing pressures in certain products, mostly in international markets, but most North American business units are reporting that pricing is stabilizing at new lower levels as the rig count flattens. 
Consolidated revenues for the U.S. declined 29% sequentially. Canada was down 37% sequentially and international revenues fell 14% sequentially. Orders improved 33% sequentially for Rig Systems but they still remained at -- they still remained low at $313 million. 
The second quarter included a jackup drilling package and a production platform drilling rig. The Rig Systems backlog declined 13% sequentially to $9 billion. At this point, we're expecting orders to remain roughly flat in the third quarter but to start to pick up in the fourth quarter, driven by higher demand for land rigs and rising inquiries around capital components. Offshore order recovery is still many quarters away, and we expect national oil company driven jackup demand to recover before floaters do. 
Within Completion & Production Solutions, orders fell 19% to $264 million, leaving backlog 18% lower sequentially. We expect orders to remain low in the third quarter, although we may get some incremental help from flexible pipe orders. The oilfield services industry we sell to is very good and stopping expenditures when oilfield activity turns down, which they're demonstrating right now. We believe these spending levels are not sustainable because they support ongoing operations by depleting their inventories of consumables and equipment they have on the shelf or by raising idled rigs for parts, components and drill pipe. As oilfield service companies gradually destock, they will eventually run out of opportunities to cannibalize their existing fleets, and we expect orders to begin to flow again to NOV, given that oil and gas remains a highly capital-intensive undertaking and that NOV is one of its largest capital manufacturers and suppliers of technology. 
Our visibility into how long they can live destocking and cannibalizing varies by product. We know drill pipe, for instance, is cannibalized from idled land rigs by some but not all drilling contractors, and drill pipe is probably a year away from meaningful recovery. On the other hand, some products feel much closer to the term. We are beginning to see some inquiries come in for drilling, motor parts and reliance. Last week, we began to see some orders for fiberglass pipe. Our XL systems conductor pipe unit, which sells mostly into the offshore, had a record quarter for inquiries during the second quarter. Demand for wireline units is holding up pretty well with the brightening outlook for the second half. After declining every single month since last October, spare parts orders within our rig aftermarket group finally picked up for the first time in July. 
A few weeks of improved order inquiries does not necessarily signal the turnaround and we're hesitant to call bottom yet. But we know from past downturns that once the rig count stabilizes, the end of destocking and cannibalization is just a matter of time. I would add, too, that I don't believe that this tedious equipment maintenance for the long run is at the top of our customers' priority list right now. Equipment is being run hard in the field and parked next to the [indiscernible] and hosed down. Customers living in the mouth aren't sure that, that particular unit will ever get a job. They sure don't want to put cash into the equipment without a firm job on the board. Just about everything on land can be cannibalized, but offshore, typically, only top drives, racker [ph] arms and roughnecks can be cannibalized cost-effectively. 
This time around, we will be helped by the fact that a lot of new generation equipment has flowed into the fleet, so the large overhang of mechanical equipment and SER equipment will be less usable and less relevant on the new Tier 1 AC rigs that the industry is migrating to. 
We also believe that the level of drilling we are stabilizing at is not sufficient through growth production which will one day be required to meet rising demand. Unfortunately, North American shale production is not rolling over yet like we had hoped, as operators are apparently high grading their drilling into the core areas of the shale plays and as completions slowly catch up with drilled wells. And now we are drilling with slowing economic growth in China and the potential return of 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran, meaning that our outlook for recovery gets pushed at least a couple more quarters into the future. 
So in the meantime, we have 3 areas of focus, one of which is to manage what we can, through cutting costs. In the second quarter, we reduced SG&A 14% sequentially and 21% since the end of 2014. Within our cost of sale structure, we are insourcing much more of our work from outside suppliers, seeking to preserve our core NOV employee base and utilizing NOV machine shops and fabrication capabilities as much as possible. Our downhole tools business decreased outsourced manufacturing spend 58% sequentially. Year-to-date, we've insourced 36,000 hours into one of our large Rig Systems manufacturing plants. By reducing overtime, winning discounts from our suppliers and high grading our supply chain across the organization, we were able to increase the margins we achieved on existing project work in Rig Systems. The segment posted 120 basis point margin improvement sequentially despite a 24% sequential reduction in revenues. 
Our drill pipe business is facing production to match orders at about half of the capacity to preserve our core team and core capabilities. These reductions were difficult but necessary and effective. We will emerge more efficient whenever the recovery finally does arrive. 
Second, we continue to invest in our long-term strategic plans, which will shape our opportunity set when we ultimately emerge in the current downturn. We're striking a balance between prudent cost reductions in the short run and investments in the future, which will see that oil and gas industry continue to rely on sophisticated technologies to supply an energy-hungry world. We intend to emerge a better company in that world. 
These initiatives include, for instance, within our Completion & Production Solutions segment, constructing a more comprehensive package of equipment for floating production systems by acquisition, by investing in R&D and working with industry partners. Over the past few years, we quietly added promising new technologies to our process flow technology group that separate oil from produced water, separate sand from production streams and inject seawater into the deepwater reservoirs. These have been added to our offering of pumps, valves [indiscernible] and other products and they complement offloading systems, cranes, deck machinery, composite piping systems, torque [indiscernible] systems and flexible pipe and a pattern of design for an FPSO [indiscernible] that can reduce steel costs by as much as 20% and boarding costs by as much as 25%. By offering a more complete package of components, and by developing standard modular packages for floating production units, we're simplifying supply chain to these complex vessels, reducing both the costs and the construction risks. This is precisely what our deepwater E&P customers are looking for. We continue to work a handful of potential large FPSO projects as the [indiscernible] we work and reduce costs. Our engineering activity has risen year-over-year, and generally, we are seeing larger vessels, boules and turrets within these projects. 
Elsewhere in the deepwater arena, we see demand for gas pipe conductor connection we have developed within our XL systems product line, which helped fuel higher sequential sales in the second quarter and strong incrementals. We've been steadily investing in technology and adding capacity in this product in West Africa and the Gulf Coast. Likewise, our flexible pipe capacity additions in Brazil led to slightly higher sequential results for this group in the second quarter, although pricing pressure on this product remains very high. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment has also assembled the global leading supplier in coiled tubing and coiled tubing units, pressure pumping, blending, mixing another fracture stimulation equipment along with wireline units and composite piping systems including quick installation, real composite pipe, that are impervious to corrosion. Technologies which are enabling the [indiscernible] evolution for which we see further growth internationally in the long run. Our large installed base of equipment offers opportunities for NOV to invest in aftermarket support and periodic recertification of high-pressure frac fleets and wireline equipment through the next few years. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment is preseing new developments in new data, software enterprise products, closed loop drilling automation systems and managed pressure drilling within the dynamic drilling solutions business unit to continue to drive safer, faster drilling operations to drive higher returns for our customers. Likely, we say large directional drillers bring new technology to lower tier marketplaces to win businesses. We believe this will create new opportunities for our downhole tools unit to also sell new technologies into these areas as well. 
We began operating our new test rig in Texas earlier this year, which provides us a great new laboratory to pioneer new technologies like these, and we expect undertake a half dozen or so drilling automation jobs through the remainder of 2015. Within this segment, this new transformative technology is built on several trusted global franchises, like Grant Prideco which pioneered premium drill pipe designs that are able to execute the challenging horizontal drilling well pads, refueling the shale revolution. Earlier this year, Grant Prideco launched a new intervention laser product and has sold 3 strains already including the industry's first 7 5/8-inch strain. 
Our Turboscope franchise worked closely with Grant Prideco to inspect, code, hard [indiscernible] a repair drill pipe along with providing critical coding, threading and quality assurance services for tubing, casing and line pipe globally. Shale programs are highly consumptive of both drill pipe as well as production of tube [indiscernible] which has helped drive growth within Turboscope within past several years. 
Likewise, our well site services business foresees longer-term growth prospects in its [indiscernible] control to improve drilling speed, drilling fluids technologies, waste management around drill cutting and water handling and management, some of the largest and most costly challenges faced by operators both onshore and offshore. NOV is, for instance, the leading provider of thermal absorption cutting treatments [indiscernible] globally and we're seeing new markets emerge in places like North Dakota, West Africa and China, which is supplementing 0 discharge rules. 
Our aftermarket segment declined more than we expected through the first half of 2015 due to the cannibalization I mentioned earlier. Spare parts purchases in particular continued to slip, which rising SPS work failed to fully offset. We expect to see the SPS project count increase again in the third quarter but at a lower rate than we would otherwise expect as customers are scrapping some rigs scheduled for SPS and postponing others until they get a contract. Customers were also trimming the scope of SPSs moving forward to be bareboned rather than seeking to upgrade and differentiate the rigs. We expect Rig Aftermarket segment revenues to be roughly flat from the second quarter to the third quarter and the fourth quarter but to again resume growth in 2016 due to its large growing installed base of sophisticated equipment requiring close OEM support. We have invested the training and support facilities closer to our customers' operations around the globe and in condition monitoring technologies that will further differentiate NOV's level of support. 
The extraordinary installed base of NOV equipment in the oilfield, following a decade of intensive retooling and the nature of this equipment and the high level of sophistication it embodies, creates a remarkable aftermarket support opportunity unique to NOV, which we will continue to vigorously prosecute. 
Turning to Rig Systems, we also see potential for future opportunities despite a very weak order environment today. Our Rig Systems segment continues to invest in rig designs for tomorrow, considerable rig floors, low-cost vessels, more highly automated land rigs, [indiscernible] control systems that enable third-party developed apps and retrievable subsea BOP pods. Offshore rig new-builds demand is expected to remain low for an extended period. We believe demand for land rigs, specifically AC Tier 1 walking electronic controlled high-pressure [indiscernible] system capable land rigs, could resume in as early as late 2015, driven by several conversations we have underway in the Middle, Latin America and in North America. 
We see the new rig technology strategy AC-powered electronic controls high levels of automation prevailing strategically in all rig categories, land and offshore. 
So to summarize, our second current initiative is to recognize that the industry will recover and to make sure that we've continued to invest in technology that will maximize our position in that recovery. NOV is unique in its ability to pioneer new technologies, new business models and capabilities to serve the industry. We will not let this downturn distract us from our long-term vision. 
Our third initiative is to deploy capital into acquisition opportunities which will emerge in this downturn. The strategies I outlined earlier can be enhanced and accelerated by combining businesses. We're actively seeking M&A opportunities, but to be clear, we will be disciplined in our approach. We have closed 3 bolt-on acquisition so far this year and have letters of intent with several more, but thus far, we find making the bids [indiscernible] converge continues to be a challenge. As most of you know, we have a long history of building NOV through acquisitions and we have a lot of experience in this area, and experience teaches us to be patient until it's time to be otherwise. In preparation for potential opportunities, we expanded our revolving line of credit to $4.5 billion during the second quarter. 
So to summarize, we are reducing costs, we are continuing to invest in our long-term plans and we are pursuing M&A opportunities to accelerate and enhance those long-term growth opportunities, all to position NOV for future growth and profitability. This could not happen without the terrific employees that make up NOV, and I want to thank them for their hard work and leadership through this difficult time. The challenging market our customers need is more than ever to provide great service and technology, crisp execution, and I'm proud to be the team that does that better than anybody. 
Now let me touch on a couple more subjects before I turn it over to Loren. Unfortunately, in Brazil, we don't have a lot more clarity on the resolution of [indiscernible] rig-building financing than we did last quarter. While there have been press reports of reductions in rig-building, we have not received any cancellations from our customers on the 22 floater for which we have binding contracts in hand to provide. Consequently, we continue to report these contracts in our backlog, and at June 30, 2015, they totaled $3.1 billion within our Rig Systems backlog. And during the second quarter, we recognized $80 million in revenue related to the shipyard where we continue to be paid. We have suspended activity in the other 3 shipyards. 
Next, the liquidation of working capital is proceeding more slowly than we would like for a couple of reasons. We had extraordinarily large cash tax payments in the quarter related to a foreign tax matter that we reported in the first quarter. The unwind of our Rig Systems background and associated customer financing will naturally [indiscernible] calculated working capital as we earn revenue against projects for which we have ready been paid. Second, the negotiation for a -- or third, the negotiated delay of several raids in shipyard means we will hold inventory to these projects longer than we originally planned, but as we noted in our last call, we expect the margins that we earn on these projects to benefit as a result, as saw in the second quarter. Finally, our customers have been slower to pick up their equipment given market conditions, resulting in inventory remaining on our books a little longer than normal. We remain focused on improving cash conversion and expect to make better progress over the next few quarters. We're also aggressively pursuing more repatriation of cash from overseas after good progress lasting on this front. We believe the second half of 2015 we'll see further improvements in this area. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Loren to discuss our second quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Loren?"
31900,296761456,839595,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Clay. I would now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenues out of backlog was down 24%",2002,"Thanks, Clay. I would now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenues out of backlog was down 24% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We completed 8 offshore drilling equipment packages during the quarter. Improved project execution and the impact of several cost reduction measures including renegotiating vendor pricing, improved logistics and supply chain optimization allowed for an increase to the segment margins. Operating profit for the segment was $395 million, yielding operating margins of 20.5%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 on improved margins on projects. 
Decremental leverage was 16% sequentially and 24% year-over-year, well below normal leverage for the business in the 30% to 40% range due to cost reductions. EBITDA was $419 million or 21.7% of sales. And EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points as a result of these cost-saving measures. Q1 to Q2, offshore revenue declined 18% and land revenues declined 35%. 
Now let's discuss capital equipment orders and the resulting backlog for NOV Rig Systems. In the second quarter, we received $313 million in new orders resulting in a book to bill of 18%, a moderate increase from Q1. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $9 billion, down 13% sequentially. Of the total $9 billion backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we expect total NOV Rig Systems revenues to decline approximately 20% into the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range. We expect to see revenue out of backlog flowing to the range of $1.3 billion as we will shift fewer land rigs and continue to work through deliveries of offshore rigs which have been rescheduled for delivery later than originally planned. We continued cost-cutting reduction initiatives to reduce overtime, to increase supply chain costs which has helped easing congestion in the shipyards, but lower volumes are expected to leave segment operating margins to decline into the mid to high teens for Q3. 
Rightsizing and efficiency savings will likely be more than offset by underabsorption resulting from revenue declines. We expect orders for offshore new-builds to remain low but we do see a few opportunities for specialized equipment like 20,000 psi and Arctic offshore rigs and jack-ups for drilling contractors to go into international oil company programs for the next 18 months or so. On land, we are seeing rising inquiries from -- an international bright spots in Latin America and in the Middle East, as there is rolling appetite for high horsepower desert rigs suited for those regions. We also have North American customers committed to their long-term strategies of high grading the technology of their rig fleets to Tier 1 ACs with high-pressure [indiscernible] systems and we believe we will again be seeing meaningful, higher land rig orders later this year. We also expect capital equipment orders to slowly recover later in the year and into 2016 with the ongoing rigs continuing to work. Nevertheless, we expect book to bill for the segment to remain below 1 for at least the next several quarters. 
Our NOV Rig Aftermarket segment sales declined more than we expected in the second quarter. It generated revenues of $657 billion, down 9% sequentially and down 16% compared to the second quarter of 2014. As Clay noted, a sharp decline in both offshore and onshore drilling activity led to sharp reductions in cash expenditures by drilling contractors, most notably in spare parts sales as customers continue to consume inventories and cannibalize equipment of stacked rigs before making any new purchases. 
Customers are doing their absolute bare minimum in terms of maintenance and repair, only what's necessary to keep their fleets running. Operating profit for the segment was $145 million [ph] , resulting in operating margins of 22.1%. Margins were down 560 basis points sequentially and 550 basis points year-over-year and sequential decremental average was on extraordinarily high 87% due to lower revenues, pricing pressure and inventory charges related to older equipment. Excluding the charges, sequential decremental leverage would've been in the mid-50s range. EBITDA was $152 million or 23.1% of sales. Land sales were approximately 25% of the total segment revenues, very consistent with Q1. 
As we move into the third quarter, we believe Rig Aftermarket revenues would be roughly flat with Q2 with slight increases across most spare parts product lines and additional repair work. This will be offset by less demand for field services and fewer manifold and expendables sales from our Mission product line. Operating margins are expected to increase slightly from Q2 on a higher mix of spare parts sales and on reduced charges. Long term, our outlook for this segment remains very bright as the industry is migrating its fleet of equipment with much more NOV technology within the installed base. 
When worldwide drilling activity recovers, drilling contractors who are currently delaying purchases will need this segment to respond quickly. And an increase in demand, accompanied with efficiencies and cost reductions currently being implemented, will position this segment for sharp improvement. 
For the second quarter of 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $956 million, down 18% sequentially and down 34% compared to second quarter of 2014 on lower global drilling activity. Operating profit for the segment is $47 million [ph] resulting in operating margins of 4.9%, down 570 basis points sequentially and 1,370 basis points for the second quarter of 2014. Segment-wide cost reduction efforts in the face of falling rig counts helped mitigate some of the intense price pressure built across the group, which helps -- helped hold sequential decrementals to 36%. 
Pricing appears to have stabilized across North American markets as the rig count has more or less stabilized and has ranged from low single digits and on up. Some international markets are continuing to receive invitations to discount as international activity has slowly declined. 
EBITDA in the second quarter was $146 million [ph] or 15.3% of revenue. As we've noted in the past, drilling activity tends to drive results for the segment overall, but portions of this business are more related to production and well servicing. So areas like tubing reclamation and line pipe coating within Turboscope are helping offset drilling-related declines. 
And looking into the third quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies revenues will be down in mid-single-digit percentage terms as backlog for drill pipe and other manufacturing products from the group have declined through the second quarter. As Clay noted earlier, our customers are destocking inventories and some of our products within Wellbore Technologies are closer to resumption of orders than others. We expect margins to decline sequentially in the second quarter of mix and continued discounting in certain areas. Nevertheless, we are also counting -- continuing to implement strategies to reduce costs while also increasing operational efficiencies around the world, and we are defending our strong market position in the Wellbore Technologies -- in the segment by investing in R&D and innovating new technologies to position ourselves for an inevitable upturn. 
NOV Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $873 million for the second quarter of 2015, down 8% sequentially and 23% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $81 million, resulting in operating margins of 9.3%, down 210 basis points sequentially and 470 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 36% and second quarter EBITDA for this segment was $141 million or 16.2% of sales. Sequential sales across this segment varied widely, with XL systems and NOV flexibles posting improvements, while sales of coiled tubing and pressure pumping equipment declined sharply on lower backlogs and on customers delaying pickup of equipment they ordered in prior periods. 
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for NOV Completion & Production Solutions. The second quarter saw an order intake of $264 million and recognized $538 million of revenue out of backlog resulting in a book to bill of 49% and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.2 billion, down 19% sequentially. Orders were down 19% from the $327 million one in Q1, and of the total $1.2 billion backlog, approximately 71% is offshore and 82% is international. 
As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we believe revenues will be roughly flat with Q2 results. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of $450 million. Lower revenues and continued pricing pressures across the segment is sure to offset reduction efforts which will result in a slight margin decline in the third quarter. We expect the next few quarters to be challenging in the FPSO space, but we expect to continue to help NOCs [ph] and [indiscernible] develop cost-effective solutions to improve the economics of offshore projects. Low oil prices have prompted these customers to reevaluate projects building and seek ways to reduce costs. The completion and production segments is well positioned to help. 
Now let's discuss our financials statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the second quarter of 2015, you will see the gross margin decline to 22.3%, generally reflecting pricing pressure partially offset by cost reductions. SG&A decreased [ph] 14% or $69 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. Other items were $17 million in the quarter, due primarily to severance and facility closing costs -- closure costs. Equity income decreased to $7 billion, and we believe that will continue to fall through the remainder of the year due to sliding demand for OCTG. Other expense for the quarter was $30 million, which represents a $26 million delta sequentially, primarily due to foreign -- fewer foreign exchange losses and asset write-offs during the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26.9%, down from the 37.6% rate we posted in the first quarter of 2015. 
First quarter -- the first quarter's rate included a discrete foreign exposure which did not reoccur. The low second quarter rate reflects a much higher mix of income from low rate foreign jurisdictions, which we expect to be -- to have a smaller effect later in the year. Looking forward to Q3, we expect that tax rate to be a little higher in comparison to the second quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding other items, was $627 million or 16% of sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our June 30, 2015, balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $6.1 billion, up $343 million or 6% sequentially. The increase was driven entirely by accrued taxes which declined $408 million [ph] in the quarter on a large cash tax payment. Other movements within working capital saw improved liabilities and accounts payable decline, which were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, down $548 million sequentially. 
Debt customer financing net of prepayments, progress billings and costs in excess of billings was a use of cash of $124 million in the quarter due to our declining backlog in Rig Systems. Inventory picked up slightly due to delays in customers picking up frac equipment and the negotiated delays in offshore rig deliveries, partially offset by inventory reductions in almost all of our business units. For the quarter, the company generated $194 million in cash flow from operations, and capital spending was $104 million, down 20% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $178 million and spent $447 million to repurchase 8.6 million shares of NOV stock for a total of $2.6 billion in share repurchases under our current $3 billion authorization. Debt increased $60 million to $4.3 billion, and our net debt to capitalization was 9.3%. As a result, we ended second quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, down $480 million sequentially. Of that $2.5 billion in cash, 3% of the balance was in the U.S. as of June 30, 2015. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

So the way we've kind adjusted our strategy here is to increase the number of conversations that we're having, and these include both the smaller bolt-on deals that I referenced. I think we've had 3 closed up so far this year and we got another half dozen letters of intent that we entered into along with some larger transactions that we've reached out to move to some companies that begin to explore. So what we're trying is approach this really from a portfolio standpoint. We have NOV's diverse in terms of what we do. We operate through 4 reporting segments, 15 business units and we have exposure to a lot of areas, so there are a lot of potential targets that are interesting that can potentially enhance our strategic positioning, and statistically, what we want to do is stay close to the hoop across multiple conversations to be ready when the stars align when both parties can reach a price that we can both view as fair."

Can you talk to that phenomenon and how much it might affect -- or what kind of a drop you're looking at maybe the next year or 2 in your offshore rig package deliveries and how you would expect decremental margins to perform in that environment?"

In the quarter, our second quarter results, we had Rig Systems down 24% sequentially at 16% decremental leverage. The group has done a good job in managing decrementals down, and actually, you saw a lift in our EBIT margin despite 24% lower revenues. But the shape you're describing is exactly what we foresee. As we push those deliveries out, it sort of spreads the revenue recognition across 4 quarters. As we explained on our last call, we benefited operationally because it enables us to execute these projects with our team and allows us to utilize our top-tier suppliers and execute the projects more systematically, less overtime, less interference between, for instance, our installation and commissioning teams and shipyard activities that are a quarter or 2, are going on in parallel, and we're trying to schedule around, step around each other on these rigs. So it actually is kind of a better world to execute these projects and maximize efficiencies and returns on these projects, but the impact on top line is really sort of baked in our guidance. So we saw Q2 down 24%. I think for Q3, we're forecasting top line for Rig Systems to be down another 20%. I think then we maybe start to level out a little bit and the quarter-to-quarter transitions become a little smoother, not to say that revenue would continue to decline with backlog following a big influx of orders, which we don't foresee at this time, so that's probably the most like outcome, but that's kind of the general shape of things. But again, I would stress, we have great experienced teams managing this business. It's not our first choice to delay things, but the silver lining on that is that we are able to execute these projects more efficiently and to manage cost of these projects and we saw evidence of that in our second quarter results we just reported."

There's been lot of conversations underway around land rigs, and I think generally, our land rig customers are much more optimistic about recovering coming from commodity prices driving higher levels of activity and against that, I would add, it's almost unanimous now, the win -- the drilling contractors should that we speak to all want to convert their fleets, the AC powered Tier 1 rigs and they recognize the more cyclical downturn, we get stuff to do, they're cutting CapEx budgets. But longer term, they see, this is where the market's going, and to be relevant and to remain competitive in that market, they really need to offer the latest and greatest technologies, and it's a way for them to differentiate themselves against smaller competitors that can't afford to write a $20 million check to buy an AC Tier 1 land rig. So I would say the strategic plans to upgrade their fleets are largely intact in North America. And then we've also seen that interest in AC land rigs spreads to other markets. So the Middle East is moving hard in this direction as well adopting new technology. Those tend to be much bigger rigs, higher horsepower, bigger ticket items. And then in South America, still a lot of interest in the Bakken [indiscernible] shale in Argentina and opportunities to add rigs there. So generally, a higher level of optimism and a growing number of conversations with land drillers that could result in orders. I don't think it would be a Q3 phenomenon, but Q4, we may start to see orders flow in around land. And then on the offshore, I think we're going to see rising demand for offshore components going into the rigs that are working and then we also have some conversations going on with drilling contractors that are affiliated with national oil companies, and these are drilling contractors should that many in Wall Street maybe have never heard of but interested in buying more specialized rigs [indiscernible] for fit for purpose to go into specific drilling programs around the globe. So we sort of plunged into this decrease here in the first half of 2015. I think midway through 2015, we're starting to have some conversations now around -- with some customers that are sort of looking past this maybe, and that gives us cause for hope. Again this won't be a Q3 phenomenon, but maybe Q4, and once we get into 2016, a little brighter outlook."

And as I've mentioned on my comments, we were a little disappointed it went up sequentially. That was entirely due to large cash tax payments, which is an extraordinary item that we had in the second quarter. But even beyond that, we have cost in excess of billings on our balance sheet and billings in excess of cost both related to our POC projects and they're a little unusual and that they represent, indicates a billings in excess of cost, cash payments our customers have made which really works sort of a deferred revenue concept. So as we've worked that down, we have to pay the cash to be use of cash as we execute those projects. We also have a couple of other moving pieces here that I referenced in the call. Inventory was up just a little bit in Q2, which is unusual given the decline in revenues, and that's related to the fact that, as we've slowed delivery of the offshore rigs, we can't slow our supply chain down to the degree that we would like. We are slowing it, and so we've continued to take inventory and associated with those projects. We got Customers slow picking up equipment along the way, and so those 2 things contributed to inventory rising slightly. The third may not be completely obvious, but for the last couple of quarters, we referenced insourcing into our own machine shops and fabrication facilities. And when you think about that, that actually uses working capital because you're buying raw materials for your machine shops to process and you're also sort of paying your employees in realtime as opposed to outsourcing this to a vendor that maybe volume raw materials and a vendor that gets paid in kind of normal payable cycle. So a lot of moving pieces in our working capital. We do know it will come down, and I think it was predictable that the turn in working capital would be delayed a quarter or 2. So we think directionally it's going to come down and become a source of cash, but I'm going to pull up sort of quantifying it for you."

So you go back a couple of years ago in $100 a barrel world, there were problems with returns, I think, on some of the deepwater developments, but frankly, I think less openness or less willingness on the part of our customers to consider sort of more radical or more revolutionary sort of approaches to changing how those projects are executed. The silver lining of a $50-barrel world has been -- we're no well convinced with those conversations with customers. We're seeing our volume of engineering work, of FEED study type work around these projects within our FPSO group rising, and that's good but we're not yet to the point where our oil company customers are necessarily pulling the trigger and sanctioning these projects and moving forward. But the good news is, it all starts with kind of a reengineering, retooling -- rescoping of these projects. You've heard of lots of examples in the E&P world that you referenced of oil companies taking out 20%, 25% out of their development costs by kind of resetting how they're going to execute these projects. I can only think that's probably helped in a lower day rate environment for rigs and a pretty hungry shipyard universe that can fabricate thick steel structures for not much above cost these days. I think that will help the economics in deepwater. But suffice to say, huge reserves discovered in the deepwater, a lot of smart people in the oil companies now with motivation to find new and better ways to develop those fields, and I think NOV is really well positioned to help them through, and we're very pleased with the progress that we have in conversations with a few of those oil companies here through the last few quarters."

This morning, we announced that National Oilwell Varco are on $0.74 per fully diluted share in the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding $17 million in pretax charges or $0.03 per share after tax related to severance of facilities closures. Earnings were $0.77 per fully diluted share, down 32% sequentially from the first quarter of 2015 and down 48% from the second quarter of 2014, excluding other items from all periods. 
Revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, down 19% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $455 million or 11.6% of sales in the second quarter. Decremental operational leverage was 26% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. EBITDA excluding charges in the second quarter was $627 million or 16% of sales, down 25% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year. 
Almost all of our business units posted lower sequential sales due to lower oil prices or activity around the globe with only a few areas like Argentina and the Middle East bucking the trend. We also felt a full quarter effect of customer discounts implemented during the first quarter, along with cost absorption challenges in manufacturing facilities. Generally, we still see some pricing pressures in certain products, mostly in international markets, but most North American business units are reporting that pricing is stabilizing at new lower levels as the rig count flattens. 
Consolidated revenues for the U.S. declined 29% sequentially. Canada was down 37% sequentially and international revenues fell 14% sequentially. Orders improved 33% sequentially for Rig Systems but they still remained that -- they still remained low at $313 million. The second quarter included a jack-up drilling package and a production platform drilling rig. The Rig Systems backlog declined 13% sequentially to $9 billion. 
At this point, we're expecting orders to remain roughly flat in the third quarter but to start to pick up in the fourth quarter, driven by higher demand for land rigs and rising inquiries around capital components. Offshore order recovery is still many quarters away, and we expect national oil company driven jack-up demand to recover before floaters do. 
Within Completion & Production Solutions, orders fell 19% to $264 million, leaving backlog 18% lower sequentially. We expect orders to remain low in the third quarter, although we may get some incremental help from flexible pipe orders. The oilfield services industry we sell to is very good and stopping expenditures when oilfield activity turns down, which they're demonstrating right now. We believe these spending levels are not sustainable because they support ongoing operations by depleting their inventories of consumables and equipment they have on the shelf or by raiding idled rigs for parts, components and drill pipe. As oilfield service companies gradually destock, they will eventually run out of opportunities to cannibalize their existing fleets and we expect orders to begin to flow again to NOV, given that oil and gas remains a highly capital-intensive undertaking and that NOV is one of its largest capital manufacturers and suppliers of technology. 
Our visibility into how long they can live destocking and cannibalizing varies by product. We know drill pipe, for instance, is cannibalized from idled land rigs by some, but not all, drilling contractors and drill pipe is probably a year away from meaningful recovery. On the other hand, some products feel much closer to the term. We are beginning to see some inquiries come in for drilling, motor parts and relines.
Last week, we began to see some new orders for fiberglass pipe. Our XL Systems conductor pipe unit, which sells mostly into the offshore, had a record quarter for inquiries during the second quarter. Demand for wireline units is holding up pretty well with the brightening outlook for the second half. After declining every single month since last October, spare parts orders within our rig aftermarket group finally picked up for the first time in July. 
A few weeks of improved order inquiries does not necessarily signal the turnaround and we're hesitant to call bottom yet. But we know from past downturns that once rig count stabilizes, the end of destocking and cannibalization is just a matter of time. I would add, too, that I don't believe that this tedious equipment maintenance for the long run is at the top of our customers' priority list right now. 
Equipment is being run hard in the field and parked next to the fence and hosed down. Customers living in the mouth aren't sure that if that particular unit will ever get a job and sure don't want to put cash into equipment without a firm job on the board. Just about everything on land can be cannibalized, but offshore, typically, only top drives, racker arms and iron roughnecks can be cannibalized cost effectively. This time around, we will be helped by the fact that a lot of the new generation equipment has flowed into the fleet, so the large overhang of mechanical equipment and SER equipment will be less usable and less relevant on the new Tier 1 AC rigs that the industry is migrating to. 
We also believe that the level of drilling we are stabilizing at is not sufficient to grow production which will one day be required to meet rising demand. Unfortunately, North American shale production is not rolling over yet like we had hoped, as operators are apparently high grading their drilling into core areas of the shale plays and as completions slowly catch up with drilled wells. And now we are dealing with slowing economic growth in China and the potential return of 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran, meaning that our outlook for recovery gets pushed at least a couple more quarters into the future. 
So in the meantime, we have 3 areas of focus, one of which is to manage what we can, we are cutting costs. In the second quarter, we reduced SG&A 14% sequentially and 21% since the end of 2014. Within our cost of sale structure, we are insourcing much more of our work from outside suppliers, seeking to preserve our core NOV employee base and utilizing NOV machine shops and fabrication capabilities as much as possible. Our downhole tools business decreased outsourced manufacturing spend 58% sequentially. 
Year-to-date, we've insourced 36,000 hours into one of our large Rig Systems manufacturing plants. By reducing over time, winning discounts from our suppliers and high grading our supply chain across the organization, we were able to increase the margins we achieved on existing project work in Rig Systems. The segment posted 120 basis point margin improvement sequentially despite a 24% sequential reduction in revenues. 
Our drill pipe business is facing production to match orders at about half of the capacity to preserve our core team and core capabilities. These reductions were difficult but necessary and effective. We will emerge more efficient when inevitable recovery finally does arrive. 
Second, we continue to invest in our long-term strategic plans which will shape our opportunity set when we ultimately emerge in the current downturn. We're striking a balance between prudent cost reductions in the short run and investments in the future, which will see the oil and gas industry continue to rely on sophisticated technologies to supply an energy-hungry world. We intend to emerge a better company in that world. 
These initiatives include, for instance, within our Completion & Production Solutions segment, constructing a more comprehensive package of equipment for floating production systems by acquisition, by investing in R&D and working with industry partners. Over the past few years, we've quietly added promising new technologies to our process flow technologies group that separate oil from produced water, separate sand from production streams and inject seawater into deepwater reservoirs. These have been added to our offering of pumps, valves, manifolds and other products, and they complement offloading systems, cranes, deck machinery, composite piping systems, torque systems and flexible pipe. And a patented design for an FPSO coal that can reduce steel costs by as much as 20% and boarding costs by as much as 25%. 
By offering a more complete package of components, and by developing standard modular packages for floating production units, we're simplifying supply chain for these complex vessels, reducing both the costs and the construction risks. This is precisely what our deepwater E&P customers are looking for. We continue to work a handful of potential large FPSO projects as the sponsors rework and reduce costs. Our engineering activity has risen year-over-year, and generally, we are seeing larger vessels, buoy and turrets within these projects. 
Elsewhere in the deepwater arena, we see demand for gas pipe conductor connection we have developed within our XL Systems product line, which helped fuel higher sequential sales in the second quarter and strong incrementals. We have been steadily investing in technology and adding capacity in this product in West Africa and the Gulf Coast. Likewise, our flexible pipe capacity additions in Brazil led to slightly higher sequential results for this group in the second quarter, although pricing pressure on this product remains very high. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment has also assembled the global leading supplier in coiled tubing and coiled tubing units, pressure pumping, blending, mixing and another fracture stimulation equipment, along with wireline units and composite piping systems including quick installation reeled composite pipe that are impervious to corrosion. Technologies which are enabling the shale revolution, for which we see further growth internationally in the long run. Our large installed base of equipment offers opportunities for NOV to invest in aftermarket support and periodic recertification of high-pressure frac fleets and wireline equipment through the next few years. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment is pressing new developments in big data, software answer products, closed loop drilling automation systems and managed pressure drilling within the dynamic drilling solutions business unit to continue to drive safer, faster drilling operations to drive higher returns for our customers. Lately, we've seen large directional drillers bring new technology to lower tier marketplaces to win businesses. We believe this will create new opportunities for our downhole tools unit to also sell new technologies into these areas as well. 
We began operating our new test rig in Navasota, Texas earlier this year, which provides us a great new laboratory to pioneer new technologies like these, and we expect undertake a half dozen or so drilling automation jobs through the remainder of 2015. Within this segment, this new transformative technology is built on several trusted global franchises, like Grant Prideco which pioneered premium drill pipe designs that are able to execute the challenging horizontal drilling well pads that are fueling the shale revolution. Earlier this year, Grant Prideco launched a new intervention riser product and have sold 3 strains already, including the industry's first 7 5/8-inch strain. 
Our Tuboscope franchise worked closely with Grant Prideco to inspect, code, hardbanding repair drill pipe, along with providing critical coding, threading and quality assurance services for tubing, casing and line pipe globally. Shale programs are highly consumptive of both drill pipe as well as production tubulars, which has helped drive good growth within Tuboscope within past several years. 
Likewise, our well site services business foresees longer-term growth prospects in solids control to improve drilling speed, drilling fluids technologies, waste management around drill cuttings and water handling and management, some of the largest and most costly challenges faced by operators both onshore and offshore. NOV is, for instance, the leading provider of thermal absorption cutting treatments units globally. And we are seeing new markets emerge in places like North Dakota, West Africa and China, which is supplementing 0 discharge rules? 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment declined more than we expected through the first half of 2015 due to the cannibalization I mentioned earlier. Spare parts purchases, in particular, continued to slip, which rising SPS work failed to fully offset. We expect to see the SPS project count increase again in the third quarter, but at a lower rate than we would otherwise expect as customers are scrapping some rigs scheduled for SPS and postponing others until they get a contract. 
Customers were also trimming the scope of SPSs moving forward to be bare boned rather than seeking to upgrade and differentiate the rigs. We expect Rig Aftermarket segment revenues to be roughly flat from the second quarter to the third quarter and fourth quarter, but to again resume growth in 2016 due to its large growing installed base of sophisticated equipment requiring close OEM support. We have invested the training and support facilities closer to our customers' operations around the globe and in condition monitoring technologies that will further differentiate NOV's level of support. 
The extraordinary installed base of NOV equipment in the oilfield, following a decade of intensive retooling and the nature of this equipment and the high level of sophistication it embodies, creates a remarkable aftermarket support opportunity unique to NOV, which we will continue to vigorously prosecute. 
Turning to Rig Systems, we also see potential for future opportunities despite a very weak order environment today. Our Rig Systems segment continues to invest in rig designs for tomorrow, configurable rig floors, low-cost vessels, more highly automated land rigs, NOVOS control systems that enable third-party developed apps and retrievable subsea BOP pods. Offshore rig new-builds demand is expected to remain low for an extended period. 
We believe demand for land rigs, specifically AC Tier 1 walking electronic controlled high-pressure mud system capable land rigs, could resume in earnest as early as late 2015, driven by several conversations we have underway in the Middle, Latin America and in North America. We see the new rig technology strategy AC-powered electronic controls high levels of automation prevailing strategically in all rig categories, land and offshore. 
So to summarize, our second current initiative is to recognize that the industry will recover and to make sure that we have continued to invest in technology that will maximize our position in that recovery. NOV is unique in its ability to pioneer new technologies, new business models and capabilities to serve the industry. We will not let this downturn distract us from our long-term vision. 
Our third initiative is to deploy capital into acquisition opportunities which will emerge in this downturn. The strategies I outlined earlier can be enhanced and accelerated by combining businesses. We're actively seeking M&A opportunities, but to be clear, we will be disciplined in our approach. We have closed 3 bolt-on acquisition so far this year and have letters of intent with several more. But thus far, we find making the bids and ask to converge continues to be a challenge. As most of you know, we have a long history of building NOV through acquisitions and we have a lot of experience in this area, and experience teaches us to be patient until it's time to be otherwise. In preparation for potential opportunities, we expanded our revolving line of credit to $4.5 billion during the second quarter. 
So to summarize, we are reducing costs, we are continuing to invest in our long-term plans and we are pursuing M&A opportunities to accelerate and enhance those long-term growth opportunities, all to position NOV for future growth and profitability. This could not happen without the terrific employees that make up NOV, and I want to thank them for their hard work and leadership through this difficult time. In a challenging market our customers need us more than ever to provide great service and technology, crisp execution, and I'm proud to be a part of the team that does that better than anybody. 
Now let me touch on a couple more subjects before I turn it over to Loren. Unfortunately, in Brazil, we don't have a lot more clarity on the resolution of Sete's rig-building financing than we did last quarter. While there had been press reports of reductions in rig-building, we have not received any cancellations from our customers on the 22 floater packages for which we have binding contracts in hand to provide. Consequently, we continue to report these contracts in our backlog. And at June 30, 2015, they totaled $3.1 billion within our Rig Systems backlog. And during the second quarter, we recognized $80 million in revenue related to the shipyard where we continue to be paid. We have suspended activity in the other 3 shipyards. 
Next, the liquidation of working capital is proceeding more slowly than we would like for a couple of reasons. We had extraordinarily large cash tax payments in the quarter related to a foreign tax matter that we reported in the first quarter. The unwind of our Rig Systems background and associated customers' financing will naturally soak up calculated working capital as we earn revenue against projects for which we have already been paid. 
Second, the negotiation -- or third, the negotiated delay of several rigs in the shipyard means we will hold inventory for these projects longer than we originally planned. But as we noted on our last call, we expect the margins that we earn on these projects to benefit as a result, as you saw in the second quarter. Finally, our customers have been slower to pick up their equipment given market conditions, resulting in inventory remaining on our books a little longer than normal. We remain focused on improving cash conversion and expect to make better progress over the next few quarters. We are also aggressively pursuing more repatriation of cash from overseas after good progress last year on this front. We believe the second half of 2015 we'll see further improvements in this area. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Loren to discuss our second quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Loren?"
31900,296761456,839926,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Clay. I would now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenues out of backlog was down 24%",1992,"Thanks, Clay. I would now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenues out of backlog was down 24% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We completed 8 offshore drilling equipment packages during the quarter. Improved project execution and the impact of several cost reduction measures including renegotiating vendor pricing, improved logistics and supply chain optimization allowed for an increase to the segment margins. 
Operating profit for the segment was $395 million, yielding operating margins of 20.5%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 on improved margins on projects. Decremental leverage was 16% sequentially and 24% year-over-year, well below normal leverage for the business in the 30% to 40% range due to cost reductions. EBITDA was $419 million or 21.7% of sales. And EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points as a result of these cost-saving measures. Q1 to Q2, offshore revenue declined 18% and land revenues declined 35%. 
Now let's discuss capital equipment orders and the resulting backlog for NOV Rig Systems. In the second quarter, we received $313 million in new orders resulting in a book to bill of 18%, a moderate increase from Q1. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $9 billion, down 13% sequentially. Of the total $9 billion backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we expect total NOV Rig Systems revenues to decline approximately 20% into the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range. We expect to see revenue out of backlog flowing to the range of $1.3 billion as we will shift fewer land rigs and continue to work through deliveries of offshore rigs which have been rescheduled for delivery later than originally planned. We continued cost-cutting reduction initiatives to reduce over time, to increase supply chain costs which has helped by easing congestion in the shipyard, but lower volumes are expected to lead segment operating margins to decline into the mid- to high-teens for Q3. 
Rightsizing and efficiency savings will likely be more than offset by underabsorption resulting from revenue declines. We expect orders for offshore new-builds to remain low, but we do see a few opportunities for specialized equipment like 20,000 psi and Arctic offshore rigs and jack-ups for drilling contractors to go into national oil company programs through the next 18 months or so. 
On land, we are seeing rising inquiries and international bright spots in Latin America and in the Middle East, as there is growing appetite for high horsepower desert rigs suited for those regions. We also have North American customers committed to their long-term strategies of high grading the technology of their rig fleets to Tier 1 ACs with high-pressure mud systems. And we believe we will again be seeing meaningful, higher land rig orders later this year. We also expect capital equipment orders to slowly recover later in the year and into 2016 toward the ongoing rigs continuing work. Nevertheless, we expect book to bill for the segment to remain below 1 for at least the next several quarters. 
Our NOV Rig Aftermarket segment sales declined more than we expected in the second quarter. It generated revenues of $657 million, down 9% sequentially and down 16% compared to the second quarter of 2014. As Clay noted, a sharp decline in both offshore and onshore drilling activity led to sharp reductions in cash expenditures by drilling contractors, most notably in spare parts sales, as customers continue to consume inventories and cannibalize equipment of stacked rigs before making any new purchases. 
Customers are doing the absolute bare minimum in terms of maintenance and repair, only what's necessary to keep their fleets running. Operating profit for the segment was $145 million, resulting in operating margins of 22.1%. Margins were down 560 basis points sequentially and 550 basis points year-over-year and sequential decremental leverage was on extraordinarily high 87% due to lower revenues, pricing pressure and inventory charges related to older equipment. Excluding the charges, sequential decremental leverage would have been in the mid-50s range. EBITDA was $152 million or 23.1% of sales. Land sales were approximately 25% of the total segment revenues, very consistent with Q1. 
As we move into the third quarter, we believe Rig Aftermarket revenues will be roughly flat with Q2, with slight increases across most spare parts products lines and additional repair work. This will be offset by less demand for field services and fewer manifold and expendables sales from our Mission product line. Operating margins are expected to increase slightly from Q2 on a higher mix of spare parts sales and on reduced charges. Long term, our outlook for this segment remains very bright as the industry is high grading its fleet of equipment with much more NOV technology within the installed base. 
When worldwide drilling activity recovers, drilling contractors who are currently delaying purchases will need this segment to respond quickly. And an increase in demand, accompanied with efficiencies and cost reductions currently being implemented, will position this segment for sharp improvement. 
For the second quarter of 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $956 million, down 18% sequentially and down 34% compared to second quarter of 2014 on lower global drilling activity. Operating profit for the segment was $47 million resulting in operating margins of 4.9%, down 570 basis points sequentially and 1,370 basis points for the second quarter of 2014. Segment-wide cost reduction efforts in the face of falling rig counts, helped mitigate some of the intense price pressure felt across the group which helped hold sequential decrementals to 36%. 
Pricing appears to have stabilized across North American markets as the rig count has more or less stabilized and has ranged from low single digits and on up. Some international markets are continuing to receive invitations to discount as international activity has slowly declined. 
EBITDA in the second quarter was $146 million or 15.3% of revenue. As we've noted in the past, drilling activity tends to drive results for the segment overall, but portions of this business are more related to production and well servicing. So areas like tubing reclamation and line pipe coating within Tuboscope are helping offset drilling-related declines. 
And looking into the third quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies revenues will be down in mid-single-digit percentage terms as backlog for drill pipe and other manufactured products from the group have declined through the second quarter. As Clay noted earlier, our customers are destocking inventories and some of our products within Wellbore Technologies are closer to resumption of orders than others. We expect margins to decline slightly from the second quarter of mix and continued discounting in certain areas. 
Nevertheless, we are also counting -- continuing to implement strategies to reduce costs, while also increasing operational efficiencies around the world, and we are defending our strong market position in the Wellbore Technologies segment by investing in R&D and innovating new technologies to position ourselves for an inevitable upturn. 
NOV Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $873 million for the second quarter of 2015, down 8% sequentially and 23% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $81 million, resulting in operating margins of 9.3%, down 210 basis points sequentially and 470 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 36% and second quarter EBITDA for the segment was $141 million or 16.2% of sales. Sequential sales across this segment varied widely, with XL Systems and NOV flexibles posting improvements, while sales of coiled tubing and pressure pumping equipment declined sharply on lower backlogs and on customers delaying pickup of equipment they ordered in prior periods. 
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for NOV Completion & Production Solutions. The second quarter saw an order intake of $264 million and recognized $538 million of revenue out of backlog resulting in a book to bill of 49% and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.2 billion, down 19% sequentially. Orders were down 19% from the $327 million won in Q1. And of the total $1.2 billion backlog, approximately 71% is offshore and 82% is international. 
As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we believe revenues will be roughly flat with Q2 results. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of $450 million. Lower revenues and continued pricing pressures across the segment is sure to offset cost reduction efforts which will result in a slight margin decline in the third quarter. We expect the next few quarters to be challenging in the FPSO space, but we expect to continue to help NOCs and IOCs develop cost-effective solutions to improve the economics of offshore projects. Low oil prices have prompted these customers to reevaluate project scoping and seek a way to reduce cost. The Completion & Production segments is well positioned to help. 
Now let's discuss our financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the second quarter of 2015, you will see that gross margin decline to 22.3%, generally reflecting pricing pressure partially offset by cost reductions. SG&A decreased 14% or $69 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. Other items were $17 million in the quarter, due primarily to severance and facility closing costs -- closure costs. 
Equity income decreased to $7 million, and we believe that will continue to fall through the remainder of the year due to sliding demand for OCTG. Other expense for the quarter was $30 million, which represents a $26 million delta sequentially, primarily due to foreign -- fewer foreign exchange losses and asset write-offs during the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26.9%, down from the 37.6% rate we posted in the first quarter of 2015. 
First quarter -- the first quarter's rate included a discrete foreign exposure which did not reoccur. The low second quarter rate reflects a much higher mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions, which we expect to be -- to have a smaller effect later in the year. Looking forward to Q3, we expect that tax rate to be a little higher in comparison to the second quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding other items, was $627 million or 16% of sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our June 30, 2015, balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $6.1 billion, up $343 million or 6% sequentially. The increase was driven entirely by accrued taxes which declined $408 million in the quarter on a large cash tax payment. Other movements within working capital saw improved liabilities and accounts payable decline, which were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, down $548 million sequentially. 
Net customer financing. The net of prepayments, progress billings and costs in excess of billings was a use of cash of $124 million in the quarter due to our declining backlog in Rig Systems. Inventory ticked up slightly due to delays in customers picking up frac equipment and the negotiated delays in offshore rig deliveries, partially offset by inventory reductions in almost all of our business units. For the quarter, the company generated $194 million in cash flow from operations and capital spending was $104 million, down 20% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $178 million and spent $447 million to repurchase 8.6 million shares of NOV stock for a total of $2.6 billion in share repurchases under our current $3 billion authorization. Debt increased $60 million to $4.3 billion, and our net debt to capitalization was 9.3%. As a result, we ended second quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, down $480 million sequentially. Of that $2.5 billion in cash, 3% of the balance was in the U.S. as of June 30, 2015. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

The risk, I think, in transactions tends to go down a little bit. But it can be a challenging market to get deals done because most companies don't particularly want to sell at the bottom, and so it's a challenge making bids and the ask come together and to reach a price that all parties view as fair and move forward. So the way we've kind adjusted our strategy here is to increase the number of conversations that we're having, and these include both the smaller bolt-on deals that I referenced. I think we've had 3 closed so far this year and we got another half dozen letters of intent that we've entered into, along with some larger transactions that we've reached out to some companies to begin to explore. So what we're trying to do is approach this, really, from a portfolio standpoint. We have NOVs diverse in terms of what we do. We operate through 4 reporting segments, 15 business units and we have exposure to a lot of areas, so there are a lot of potential targets that are interesting that can potentially enhance our strategic positioning. And statistically, what we want to do is stay close to the hoop across multiple conversations to be ready when the stars align and when both parties can reach a price that we can both view as fair."

In our second quarter results, we had Rig Systems down 24% sequentially at 16% decremental leverage. So the group has done a good job in managing decrementals down. And actually, you saw a lift in their EBIT margin, despite 24% lower revenues. But the shape you're describing is exactly what we foresee. As we push those deliveries out, it sort of spreads the revenue recognition across 4 quarters. As we explained on our last call, we benefited operationally because it enables us to execute these projects with our A team and allows us to utilize our top-tier suppliers and execute the projects more systematically, less over time, less interference between, for instance, our installation and commissioning teams and shipyard activities that are a quarter or 2 were going on in parallel, and we're trying to schedule around and step around each other on these rigs. So it actually is kind of a better world to execute these projects and maximize efficiency and returns on these projects, but the impact on the top line is really sort of baked in our guidance. So we saw Q2 down 24%. I think, for Q3, we're forecasting top line for Rig Systems to be down another 20%. I think then we maybe start to level out a little bit and the quarter-to-quarter transitions become a little smoother. Not to say that revenue would continue to decline with backlog barring big influx of orders, which we don't foresee at this time, so that's probably the most like outcome, but that's kind of the general shape of things. But again, I would stress, we have great experienced teams managing this business. It's not our first choice to delay things, but the silver lining on that is that we are able to execute these projects more efficiently, to manage cost to these projects, and you saw evidence of that in our second quarter results we just reported."

And I think, generally, our land rig customers are much more optimistic about recovering commodity prices, driving higher levels of activity. And against that, I would add, it's almost unanimous now, the drilling contractors that we speak to all want to convert their fleets to AC-powered Tier 1 rigs. And they recognized we're in cyclical downturn, they've got stuff to do, they're cutting CapEx budgets. But longer term they see, hey, this is where the market is going? And to be relevant and to remain competitive in that market, they really need to offer the latest and greatest technologies, and it's a way for them to differentiate themselves against smaller competitors that can't afford to write a $20 million check to buy an AC Tier 1 land rig. So I would say the strategic plans to upgrade their fleets were largely intact in North America. And then we've also seen that interest in AC land rigs spread to other markets. So the Middle East is moving hard in this direction as well adopting new technology. Those tend to be much bigger rigs, higher horsepower, bigger ticket items. And then in South America, still a lot of interest in the [indiscernible] shale in Argentina and the opportunities to add rigs there. So generally, a higher level of optimism and a growing number of conversations with land drillers that could result in orders. I don't think it would be a Q3 phenomenon, but Q4, we may start to see orders flow in around land. And then on the offshore, I think we're going to see rising demand for offshore components going into the rigs that are working. And then we also have some conversations going on with drilling contractors that are affiliated with national oil companies. And these are drilling contractors that many in Wall Street maybe have never heard of, but interested in buying more specialized rigs, rigs that are more fit for purpose to go into specific drilling programs around the globe. So we sort of plunged into this decrease here to the first half of 2015. I think midway through 2015, we're starting to have some conversations now around -- with some customers that are sort of looking past this maybe, and that gives us cause for hope. But again, this won't be a Q3 phenomenon, but maybe Q4. And once we get into 2016, a little brighter outlook for orders."

And as I've mentioned on my comments, we were a little disappointed it went up sequentially. That was entirely due to large cash tax payments, which is an extraordinary item that we had in the second quarter. But even beyond that, we have cost in excess of billings on our balance sheet and billings in excess of cost both related to our POC projects. And they're a little unusual in that they represent, in the case of billings, it's an excess of cost, cash payments our customers had made which really works sort of like a deferred revenue concept. So as we've worked that down, we've already even paid the cash, to be use of cash as we execute those projects. We also have a couple of other moving pieces here that I referenced in the call. Inventory was up just a little bit in Q2, which is unusual given the decline in revenues, and that's related to the fact that, as we've slowed delivery of these big offshore rigs, we can't slow our supply chain down to the degree that we would like. We are slowing it but -- so we've continued to take inventory in associated with those projects. We've got customers slow point picking up equipment along the way, and so those 2 things contributed to inventory rising slightly. The third may not be completely obvious, but for the last couple of quarters, we referenced insourcing into our own machine shops and fabrication facilities. And if you think about that, that actually uses working capital because you're buying raw materials for your machine shops to process and you're also sort of paying your employees in realtime as opposed to outsourcing this to a vendor that may be buying raw materials in a vendor that gets paid in kind of normal payable cycle. So a lot of moving pieces in our working capital. We do know it will come down. And I think it was predictable that the turn in working capital would be delayed a quarter or 2. So we think directionally it's going to be coming down and become a source of cash, but I'm going to pull up sort of quantifying it for you."

Now it's a real step change in attitude, but they're still a ways from signing purchase orders and sanctioning these projects. So you go back a couple of years ago in a $100 a barrel world, there were problems with returns, I think, on some of the deepwater developments. But frankly, I think less openness or less willingness on the part of our customers to consider sort of more radical or more revolutionary sort of approaches to changing how those projects are executed. The silver lining of a $50-barrel world has been -- we're now welcomed in those conversations with those customers. We're seeing our volume of engineering work, of FEED study-type work around these projects within our FPSO group rising. And that's good, but we're not yet to the point where our oil company customers are necessarily pulling the trigger and sanctioning these projects and moving forward. But the good news is, it all starts with kind of a reengineering, retooling, rescoping of these projects. You've heard of lots of examples in the E&P world that you referenced of oil companies taking out 20%, 25% out of their development costs by kind of resetting how they're going to execute these projects. I can only think that's probably helped in a lower day rate environment for rigs and a pretty hungry shipyard universe that can fabricate thick steel structures for not much above cost these days. So that, I think, will all help the economics of the deepwater. But suffice to say, huge reserves discovered in the deepwater, a lot of smart people at the oil companies now with motivation to find new and better ways to develop those fields. And I think NOV is really well positioned to help them through, and we're very pleased with the progress that we have in conversations with a few of those oil companies here through the last few quarters."

This morning, we announced that National Oilwell Varco earned $0.74 per fully diluted share in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015, on U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding $17 million in pretax charges or $0.03 per share",2938,"Thank you, Loren, and welcome, everyone. This morning, we announced that National Oilwell Varco earned $0.74 per fully diluted share in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015, on U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding $17 million in pretax charges or $0.03 per share after tax related to severance of facilities closures, earnings were $0.77 per fully diluted share, down 32% sequentially from the first quarter of 2015 and down 48% from the second quarter of 2014, excluding other items from all periods. 
Revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, down 19% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $455 million or 11.6% of sales in the second quarter. Decremental operational leverage was 26% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. EBITDA excluding charges in the second quarter was $627 million or 16% of sales, down 25% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year. 
Almost all of our business units posted lower sequential sales due to lower oil prices and activity around the globe with only a few areas like Argentina and the Middle East bucking the trend. We also felt a full quarter effect of customer discounts implemented during the first quarter, along with cost-absorption challenges in manufacturing facilities. Generally, we still see some pricing pressures in certain products, mostly in international markets, but most North American business units are reporting that pricing is stabilizing at new lower levels as the rig count flattens. Consolidated revenues for the U.S. declined 29% sequentially. Canada was down 37% sequentially. And international revenues fell 14% sequentially. 
Orders improved 33% sequentially for Rig Systems, but they still remained at -- they still remained low at $313 million. The second quarter included a jackup drilling package and a production platform drilling rig. The Rig Systems backlog declined 13% sequentially to $9 billion. 
At this point, we're expecting orders to remain roughly flat in the third quarter but to start to pick up in the fourth quarter, driven by higher demand for land rigs and rising inquiries around capital components. Offshore order recovery is still many quarters away, and we expect national oil company driven jackup demand to recover before floaters do. 
Within Completion & Production Solutions, orders fell 19% to $264 million, leaving backlog 18% lower sequentially. We expect orders to remain low in the third quarter, although we may get some incremental help from flexible pipe orders. The oilfield services industry we sell to is very good at stopping expenditures when oilfield activity turns down, which they are demonstrating right now. We believe these spending levels are not sustainable because they support ongoing operations by depleting their inventories of consumables and equipment they have on the shelf or by raiding idled rigs for parts, components and drillpipe. As oilfield service companies gradually destock, they will eventually run out of opportunities to cannibalize their existing fleets, and we expect orders to begin to flow again to NOV, given that oil and gas remains a highly capital-intensive undertaking and that NOV is one of its largest capital manufacturers and suppliers of technology. 
Our visibility into how long they can live destocking and cannibalizing varies by product. We know drillpipe, for instance, is cannibalized from idled land rigs by some but not all drilling contractors, and drillpipe is probably a year away from meaningful recovery. On the other hand, some products feel much closer to the turn. We're beginning to see some inquiries come in for drilling, motor parts and relines.
Last week, we began to see some new orders for fiberglass pipe. Our XL Systems conductor pipe unit, which sells mostly into the offshore, had a record quarter for inquiries during the second quarter. Demand for wireline units is holding up pretty well with a brightening outlook for the second half. After declining every single month since last October, spare parts orders within our rig aftermarket group finally picked up for the first time in July. 
A few weeks of improved order inquiries does not necessarily signal the turnaround, and we're hesitant to call bottom yet. But we know from past downturns that once the rig count stabilizes, the end of destocking and cannibalization is just a matter of time. I would add, too, that I don't believe that fastidious equipment maintenance for the long run is at the top of our customers' priority list right now. 
Equipment is being run hard in the field and parked next to the fence and hosed down. Customers living hand-to-mouth aren't sure that if that particular unit will ever get another job and sure don't want to put cash into equipment without a firm job on the board. Just about everything on land can be cannibalized, but offshore, typically, only top drives, racker arms and iron roughnecks can be cannibalized cost effectively. This time around, we will be helped by the fact that a lot of new-generation equipment has flowed into the fleet, so the large overhang of mechanical equipment and SCR equipment will be less usable and less relevant on the new tier 1 AC rigs that the industry is migrating to. 
We also believe that the level of drilling we are stabilizing at is not sufficient to grow production which will one day be required to meet rising demand. Unfortunately, North American shale production is not rolling over yet like we had hoped as operators are apparently high-grading their drilling into core areas of the shale plays and as completions slowly catch up with drilled wells. And now we are dealing with slowing economic growth in China and the potential return of 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran, meaning that our outlook for recovery gets pushed at least a couple more quarters into the future. 
So in the meantime, we have 3 areas of focus, one of which is to manage what we can: we are cutting costs. In the second quarter, we reduced SG&A 14% sequentially and 21% since the end of 2014. Within our cost-of-sales structure, we are insourcing much more of our work from outside suppliers, seeking to preserve our core NOV employee base and utilize NOV machine shops and fabrication capabilities as much as possible. Our downhole tools business decreased outsourced manufacturing spend 58% sequentially. 
Year-to-date, we've insourced 36,000 hours into one of our large Rig Systems manufacturing plants. By reducing overtime, winning discounts from our suppliers and high-grading our supply chain across the organization, we were able to increase the margins we achieved on existing project work in Rig Systems. The segment posted 120 basis point margin improvement sequentially despite a 24% sequential reduction in revenues. 
Our drillpipe business is pacing production to match orders at about half of capacity to preserve our core team and core capabilities. These reductions were difficult but necessary and effective. We will emerge more efficient when the inevitable recovery finally does arrive. 
Second, we continue to invest in our long-term strategic plans, which will shape our opportunity set when we ultimately emerge from the current downturn. We're striking a balance between prudent cost reductions in the short run and investments in a future which will see the oil and gas industry continue to rely on sophisticated technologies to supply an energy-hungry world. We intend to emerge a better company in that world. 
These initiatives include, for instance, within our Completion & Production Solutions segment, constructing a more comprehensive package of equipment for floating production systems by acquisition, by investing in R&D and working with industry partners. Over the past few years, we've quietly added promising new technologies to our Process & Flow Technologies group that separate oil from produced waters, separate sand from production streams and inject seawater into deepwater reservoirs. These have been added to our offering of pumps, valves, manifolds and other products, and they complement offloading systems, cranes, deck machinery, composite piping systems, turret mooring systems and flexible pipe, and a patented design for an FPSO hull that can reduce steel costs by as much as 20% and mooring costs by as much as 25%. 
By offering a more complete package of components and by developing standard modular packages for floating production units, we're simplifying supply chain for these complex vessels, reducing both the cost and the construction risk. This is precisely what our deepwater E&P customers are looking for. We continue to work a handful of potential large FPSO projects as the sponsors rework and reduce costs. Our engineering activity has risen year-over-year, and generally, we are seeing larger vessels, buoys and turrets within these projects. 
Elsewhere in the deepwater arena, we see demand for gas-tight conductor connections we have developed within our XL Systems product line, which helped fuel higher sequential sales in the second quarter at strong incrementals. We have been steadily investing in technology and adding capacity in this product in West Africa and the Gulf Coast. Likewise, our flexible pipe capacity additions in Brazil led to slightly higher sequential results for this group in the second quarter, although pricing pressure on this product remains very high. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment has also assembled the global leading supplier of coiled tubing and coiled tubing units; pressure pumping, blending, mixing and other fracture stimulation equipment; along with wireline units and composite piping systems, including quick-installation reeled composite pipe that are impervious to corrosion -- technologies which are enabling the shale revolution, for which we see further growth internationally in the long run. Our large installed base of equipment offers opportunities for NOV to invest in aftermarket support and periodic recertification of high-pressure frac fleets and wireline equipment through the next few years. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment is pressing new developments in Big Data, software answer products, closed-loop drilling automation systems and managed pressure drilling within the Dynamic Drilling Solutions business unit to continue to drive safer, faster drilling operations to drive higher returns for our customers. Lately, we've seen large directional drillers bring new technology to lower-tier marketplaces to win businesses. We believe this will create new opportunities for our downhole tools unit to also sell new technologies into these areas as well. 
We began operating our new test rig in Navasota, Texas, earlier this year, which provides us a great new laboratory to pioneer new technologies like these, and we expect to undertake a half dozen or so drilling automation jobs through the remainder of 2015. Within the segment, these new transformative technologies build on several trusted global franchises like Grant Prideco, which pioneered premium drillpipe designs that are able to execute the challenging horizontal drilling wellpaths that are fueling the shale revolution. Earlier this year, Grant Prideco launched a new intervention riser product and had sold 3 strings already, including the industry's first 7 5/8-inch string. 
Our Tuboscope franchise worked closely with Grant Prideco to inspect, code, hardband and repair drillpipe, along with providing critical coating, threading and quality assurance services for tubing, casing and line pipe globally. Shale programs are highly consumptive of both drillpipe as well as production tubulars, which has helped drive good growth within Tuboscope through the past several years. 
Likewise, our Wellsite Services business foresees longer-term growth prospects in solids control to improve drilling speeds, drilling fluids technologies, waste management around drill cuttings and water handling and management, some of the largest and most costly challenges faced by operators both onshore and offshore. NOV is, for instance, the leading provider of thermal absorption cutting treatments units globally. And we are seeing new markets emerge in places like North Dakota, West Africa and China, which is supplementing 0 discharge rules.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment declined more than we expected through the first half of 2015 due to the cannibalization I mentioned earlier. Spare parts purchases, in particular, continued to slip, which rising SPS work failed to fully offset. We expect to see the SPS project count increase again in the third quarter but at a lower rate than we would otherwise expect as customers are scrapping some rigs scheduled for SPS and postponing others until they get a contract. 
Customers are also trimming the scope of SPSs moving forward to be bare bones rather than seeking to upgrade and differentiate their rigs. We expect Rig Aftermarket segment revenues to be roughly flat from the second quarter to the third quarter and fourth quarter but to again resume growth in 2016 due to its large and growing installed base of sophisticated equipment requiring close OEM support. We've invested in training and support facilities closer to our customers' operations around the globe and in condition monitoring technologies that will further differentiate NOV's level of support. 
Extraordinary installed base of NOV equipment in the oilfield, following, a decade of intensive retooling and the nature of this equipment and the high level of sophistication it embodies, creates a remarkable aftermarket support opportunity unique to NOV, which we will continue to vigorously prosecute. 
Turning to Rig Systems, we also see potential for future opportunities despite a very weak order environment today. Our Rig Systems segment continues to invest in rig designs for tomorrow: configurable rig floors, low-cost vessels, more highly automated land rigs, NOVOS control systems that enable third-party developed apps and retrievable subsea BOP pods. While offshore rig newbuild's demand is expected to remain low for an extended period, we believe demand for land rigs, specifically AC Tier 1 walking electronic controlled high-pressure mud system capable land rigs could resume in earnest as early as late 2015, driven by several conversations we have underway in the Middle East, Latin America and in North America. We see the new rig technology strategy -- AC-powered electronic controls, high levels of automation -- prevailing strategically in all rig categories: land and offshore. 
So to summarize, our second current initiative is to recognize that the industry will recover and to make sure that we have continued to invest in technology that will maximize our position in that recovery. NOV is unique in its ability to pioneer new technologies, new business models and capabilities to serve the industry, and we will not let this downturn distract us from our long-term vision. 
Our third initiative is to deploy capital into acquisition opportunities which will emerge in this downturn. The strategies I outlined earlier can be enhanced and accelerated by combining businesses. We're actively seeking M&A opportunities, but to be clear, we will be disciplined in our approach. We have closed 3 bolt-on acquisitions so far this year and have letters of intent with several more. But thus far, we find making the bids and asks converge continues to be a challenge. As most of you know, we have a long history of building NOV through acquisitions, and we have a lot of experience in this area. That experience teaches us to be patient until it's time to be otherwise. In preparation for potential opportunities, we expanded our revolving line of credit to $4.5 billion during the second quarter. 
So to summarize. We are reducing costs. We are continuing to invest in our long-term plans. And we are pursuing M&A opportunities to accelerate and enhance those long-term growth opportunities, all to position NOV for future growth and profitability. This could not happen without the terrific employees that make up NOV, and I want to thank them for their hard work and leadership through this difficult time. In a challenging market, our customers need us more than ever to provide great service and technology and crisp execution, and I'm proud to be a part of the team that does that better than anybody. 
Now let me touch on a couple more subjects before I turn it over to Loren. Unfortunately, in Brazil, we don't have a lot more clarity on the resolution of Sete's rig-building financing than we did last quarter. While there had been press reports of reductions in rig building, we have not received any cancellations from our customers on the 22 floater packages for which we have binding contracts in hand to provide. Consequently, we continue to report these contracts in our backlog. And at June 30, 2015, they totaled $3.1 billion within our Rig Systems backlog. And during the second quarter, we recognized $80 million in revenue related to the shipyard where we continue to be paid. We have suspended activity in the other 3 shipyards. 
Next, the liquidation of working capital is proceeding more slowly than we would like for a couple of reasons. We had extraordinarily large cash tax payments in the quarter related to a foreign tax matter that we reported in the first quarter. The unwind of our Rig Systems backlog and associated customer financing will naturally soak up calculated working capital as we earn revenue against projects for which we have already been paid. 
Second, the -- or third, the negotiated delay of several rigs in the shipyard means we will hold inventory for these projects longer than we originally planned. But as we noted on our last call, we expect the margins that we earn on these projects to benefit as a result, as you saw in the second quarter. Finally, our customers have been slower to pick up their equipment given market conditions, resulting in inventory remaining on our books a little longer than normal. We remain focused on improving cash conversion and expect to make better progress over the next few quarters. We're also aggressively pursuing more repatriation of cash from overseas after good progress last year on this front. We believe the second half of 2015 will see further improvements in this area. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Loren to discuss our second quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Loren?"

I would now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenue out of backlog was down 24% s",1973,"Thanks, Clay. I would now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenue out of backlog was down 24% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We completed 8 offshore drilling equipment packages during the quarter. Improved project execution and the impact of several cost-reduction measures including renegotiating vendor pricing, improved logistics and supply chain optimization, allowed for an increase to the segment margins. 
Operating profit for the segment was $395 million, yielding operating margins of 20.5%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 on improved margins on projects. Decremental leverage was 16% sequentially and 24% year-over-year, well below normal leverage for the business in the 30% to 40% range due to cost reductions. EBITDA was $419 million or 21.7% of sales, and EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points as a result of these cost-saving measures. Q1 to Q2, offshore revenue declined 18%, and land revenues declined 35%. 
Now let's discuss capital equipment orders and the resulting backlog for NOV Rig Systems. In the second quarter, we received $313 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 18%, a moderate increase from Q1. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $9 billion, down 13% sequentially. Of the total $9 billion backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we expect total NOV Rig Systems revenues to decline approximately 20% into the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range. We expect to see revenue out of backlog slowing to the range of $1.3 billion as we will shift fewer land rigs and continue to work through deliveries of offshore rigs which have been rescheduled for delivery later than originally planned. We continued cost-cutting reduction initiatives to reduce overtime, decrease supply chain cost, which has helped by easing congestion in the shipyards, but lower volumes are expected to lead segment operating margins to decline into the mid- to high teens for Q3. 
Rightsizing and efficiency savings will likely be more than offset by underabsorption resulting from revenue declines. We expect orders for offshore newbuilds to remain low, but we do see a few opportunities for specialized equipment like 20,000 psi and Arctic offshore rigs and jackups for drilling contractors to go into national oil company programs through the next 18 months or so. 
On land, we are seeing rising inquiries and international bright spots in Latin America and in the Middle East, as there is growing appetite for high-horsepower desert rigs suited for those regions. We also have North American customers committed to their long-term strategies of high-grading the technology of their rig fleets to Tier 1 ACs with high-pressure mud systems. And we believe we will again seeing meaningful, higher land rig orders later this year. We also expect capital equipment orders to slowly recover later in the year and into 2016 to support the ongoing rigs continuing work. Nevertheless, we expect book-to-bill for the segment to remain below 1 for at least the next several quarters. 
Our NOV Rig Aftermarket segment sales declined more than we expected in the second quarter. It generated revenues of $657 million, down 9% sequentially and down 16% compared to the second quarter of 2014. As Clay noted, a sharp decline in both offshore and onshore drilling activity led to sharp reductions in cash expenditures by drilling contractors, most notably in spare parts sales as customers continue to consume inventories and cannibalize equipment off stacked rigs before making any new purchases. 
Customers are doing the absolute bare minimum in terms of maintenance and repair, only what's necessary to keep their fleets running. Operating profit for the segment was $145 million, resulting in operating margins of 22.1%. Margins were down 560 basis points sequentially and 550 basis points year-over-year, and sequential decremental leverage was on extraordinarily high 87% due to lower revenues, pricing pressure and inventory charges related to older equipment. Excluding the charges, sequential decremental leverage would have been in the mid-50s range. EBITDA was $152 million or 23.1% of sales. Land sales were approximately 25% of the total segment revenues, very consistent with Q1. 
As we move into the third quarter, we believe Rig Aftermarket revenues will be roughly flat with Q2 with slight increases across most spare parts products lines and additional repair work. This will be offset by less demand for field services and fewer manifold and expendables sales from our Mission product line. Operating margins are expected to increase slightly from Q2 on a higher mix of spare parts sales and on reduced charges. Long term, our outlook for this segment remains very bright as the industry is high-grading its fleet of equipment with much more NOV technology within the installed base. 
When worldwide drilling activity recovers, drilling contractors who are currently delaying purchases will need this segment to respond quickly. And an increase in demand accompanied with efficiencies and cost reductions currently being implemented, will position this segment for sharp improvement. 
For the second quarter of 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $956 million, down 18% sequentially and down 34% compared to second quarter of 2014 on lower global drilling activity. Operating profit for the segment was $47 million resulting in operating margins of 4.9%, down 570 basis points sequentially and 1,370 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. Segment-wide cost-reduction efforts in the face of falling rig counts helped mitigate some of the intense price pressure felt across the group, which helped hold sequential decrementals to 36%. 
Pricing appears to have stabilized across North American markets as the rig count has more-or-less stabilized and has ranged from low single digits and on up. Some international markets are continuing to receive invitations to discount as international activity has slowly declined. 
EBITDA in the second quarter was $146 million or 15.3% of revenue. As we've noted in the past, drilling activity tends to drive results for the segment overall, but portions of this business are more related to production and well servicing. So areas like tubing reclamation and linepipe coating within Tuboscope are helping offset drilling-related declines. 
And looking into the third quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies revenues will be down in mid-single-digit percentage terms as backlog for drill pipe and other manufactured products from the group have declined through the second quarter. As Clay noted earlier, our customers are destocking inventories, and some of our products within Wellbore Technologies are closer to resumption of orders than others. We expect margins to decline slightly from the second quarter on mix and continued discounting in certain areas. 
Nevertheless, we are also counting -- continuing to implement strategies to reduce costs while also increasing operational efficiencies around the world, and we are defending our strong market positions within the Wellbore Technologies segment by investing in R&D and innovating new technologies to position ourselves for an inevitable upturn. 
NOV Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $873 million for the second quarter of 2015, down 8% sequentially and 23% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $81 million, resulting in operating margins of 9.3%, down 210 basis points sequentially and 470 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 36% and second quarter EBITDA for the segment was $141 million or 16.2% of sales. Sequential sales across this segment varied widely with XL Systems and NOV flexibles posting improvements, while sales of coiled tubing and pressure pumping equipment declined sharply on lower backlogs and on customers delaying pickup of equipment they ordered in prior periods. 
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for NOV Completion & Production Solutions. The second quarter saw an order intake of $264 million and recognized $538 million of revenue out of backlog resulting in a book-to-bill of 49% and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.2 billion, down 19% sequentially. Orders were down 19% from the $327 million won in Q1, and of the total $1.2 billion backlog, approximately 71% is offshore and 82% is international. 
As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we believe revenues will be roughly flat with Q2 results. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of $450 million. Lower revenues and continued pricing pressures across the segment should offset cost-reduction efforts, which will result in a slight margin decline in the third quarter. We expect the next few quarters to be challenging in the FPSO space, but we expect to continue to help NOCs and IOCs develop cost-effective solutions to improve the economics of offshore projects. Low oil prices have prompted these customers to reevaluate project scoping and seek ways to reduce costs. The Completion & Production segment is well positioned to help. 
Now let's discuss our financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the second quarter of 2015, you will see that gross margin decline to 22.3%, generally reflecting pricing pressure partially offset by cost reductions. SG&A decreased 14% or $69 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. Other items were $17 million in the quarter, due primarily to severance and facility closing costs -- closure cost. 
Equity income decreased to $7 million, and we believe that will continue to fall through the remainder of the year due to sliding demand for OCTG. Other expense for the quarter was $30 million, which represents a $26 million delta sequentially, primarily due to foreign -- fewer foreign exchange losses and asset writeoffs during the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26.9%, down from the 37.6% rate we posted in the first quarter of 2015. 
First quarter -- the first quarter's rate included a discrete foreign exposure which did not reoccur. The low second quarter rate reflects a much higher mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions, which we expect to be -- to have a smaller effect later in the year. Looking forward to Q3, we expect the tax rate to be a little higher in comparison to the second quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding other items, was $627 million or 16% of sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our June 30, 2015, balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt of $6.1 billion, up $343 million or 6% sequentially. The increase was driven entirely by accrued taxes, which declined $408 million in the quarter on a large cash tax payment. Other movements within working capital saw accrued liabilities and accounts payable decline, which were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, down $548 million sequentially. 
Net customer financing. The net of prepayments, progress billings and costs in excess of billings was a use of cash of $124 million in the quarter due to our declining backlog in Rig Systems. Inventory ticked up slightly due to delays in customers picking up frac equipment and the negotiated delays in offshore rig deliveries, partially offset by inventory reductions in almost all of our business units. For the quarter, the company generated $194 million in cash flow from operations, and capital spending was $104 million, down 20% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $178 million and spent $447 million to repurchase 8.6 million shares of NOV stock for a total of $2.6 billion in share repurchases under our current $3 billion authorization. Debt increased $60 million to $4.3 billion, and our net debt to capitalization was 9.3%. As a result, we ended second quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, down $480 million sequentially. Of that $2.5 billion in cash, 3% of the balance was in the U.S. as of June 30, 2015. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

I'd say, generally, in a cyclical downturn, and this is one of many we've been through, our view is it becomes much more of a buyers market. Risk, I think, in transactions tends to go down a little bit. But it can be a challenging market to get deals done because most companies don't particularly want to sell at the bottom, and so it's a challenge making bids and the asks come together and to reach a price that all parties view as fair and move forward. So the way we've kind adjusted our strategy here is to increase the number of conversations that we're having, and these include both the smaller bolt-on deals that I referenced. I think we've had 3 close so far this year, and we've got another half dozen letters of intent that we've entered into along with some larger transactions that we've reached out to some companies to begin to explore. So what we're trying to do is approach this, really, from a portfolio standpoint. We have -- NOV's diverse in terms of what we do. We operate through 4 reporting segments, 15 business units, and we have exposure to a lot of areas, so there are a lot of potential targets that are interesting that can potentially enhance our strategic positioning. And statistically, what we want to do is stay close to the hoop across multiple conversations to be ready when the stars align and when we -- both parties can reach a price that we can both view as fair."

In our second quarter results, we had Rig Systems down 24% sequentially at 16% decremental leverage. So the group's done a great job managing decrementals down. And actually, you saw a lift in their EBIT margin despite 24% lower revenues. But the shape you're describing is exactly what we foresee. As we push those deliveries out, it sort of spreads the revenue recognition across more quarters. As we explained on our last call, we benefit operationally because it enables us to execute these projects with our A team and allows us to utilize our top-tier suppliers and execute the projects more systematically, less overtime, less interference between, for instance, our installation and commissioning teams and shipyard activities that are a quarter or 2 were going on in parallel, and we're trying to schedule around and step around each other on these rigs. So it actually is kind of a better world to execute these projects and maximize efficiency and returns on the projects, but the impact on the top line is really sort of baked in our guidance. So we saw Q2 down 24%. I think, for Q3, we're forecasting top line for Rig Systems to be down another 20%. I think then we maybe start to level out a little bit and the quarter-to-quarter transitions become a little smoother. Not to say that revenue would continue to decline with backlog barring a big influx of orders, which we don't foresee at this time, so that's probably the most likely outcome, but that's kind of the general shape of things. But again, I would stress, we have great experienced teams managing this business. It's not our first choice to delay things, but the silver lining on that is that we are able to execute these projects more efficiently to manage costs for these projects, and you saw evidence of that in our second quarter results we just reported."

And I think, generally, our land rig customers are much more optimistic about recovering commodity prices, driving higher levels of activity. And against that, I would add, it's almost unanimous now, the drilling contractors that we speak to all want to convert their fleets to AC-powered Tier 1 rigs. And they recognize we're in a cyclical downturn. It gets tough to do. They're cutting CapEx budgets. But longer term, they see, hey, this is where the market is going. And to be relevant and to remain competitive in that market, they really need to offer the latest and greatest technologies, and it's a way for them to differentiate themselves against smaller competitors that can't afford to write a $20 million check to buy an AC Tier 1 land rig. So I would say the strategic plans to upgrade their fleets were largely intact in North America. And then we've also seen that interest in AC land rigs spread to other markets. So the Middle East is moving hard in this direction as well adopting new technology. Those tend to be much bigger rigs, higher horsepower, bigger-ticket items. And then in South America, still a lot of interest in the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina and opportunities to add rigs there. So generally, a higher level of optimism and a growing number of conversations with land drillers that could result in orders. I don't think it'll be a Q3 phenomenon, but Q4, we may start to see some orders flow in around land. And then on the offshore, I think we're going to see rising demand for offshore components going into the rigs that are working. And then we also have some conversations going on with drilling contractors that are affiliated with national oil companies. And these are drilling contractors that many in Wall Street maybe have never heard of but interested in buying more specialized rigs, rigs that are more fit for purpose to go into specific drilling programs around the globe. So we sort of plunged into this deep freeze here through the first half of 2015. I think midway through 2015, we're starting to add some conversations now around -- with some customers that are sort of looking past this maybe, and that gives us cause for hope that, again, this won't be a Q3 phenomenon, but maybe Q4. And once we get into 2016, a little brighter outlook for orders."

And as I've mentioned on my comments, we were a little disappointed it went up sequentially. That was entirely due to large cash tax payments, which is an extraordinary item that we had in the second quarter. But even beyond that, we have cost in excess of billings on our balance sheet and billings in excess of cost both related to our POC projects. And they're a little unusual in that they represent, in the case of billings, an excess of cost, cash payments our customers had made which really works sort of like a deferred revenue concept. So as we've worked that down, we've already even paid to cash, to be a use of cash as we execute those projects. We also have a couple other moving pieces here that I referenced in the call. Inventory was up just a little bit in Q2, which is unusual given the decline in revenues, and that's related to the fact that, as we've slowed delivery of these big offshore rigs, we can't slow our supply chain down to the degree that we would like. We are slowing it, but -- so we've continued to take inventory in -- associated with those projects. We've got customers slow -- point picking up equipment along the way, and so those 2 things contributed to inventory rising slightly. The third may not be completely obvious, but for the last couple of quarters, we referenced insourcing into our own machine shops and fabrication facilities. And if you think about that, that actually uses working capital because you're buying raw materials for your machine shops to process, and you're also sort of paying your employees in realtime as opposed to outsourcing this to a vendor that may be buying raw materials, and a vendor that gets paid in kind of the normal payable cycle. So a lot of moving pieces in our working capital. We do know it'll come down. And I think it was predictable that the turn in working capital would be delayed a quarter or 2. So we think directionally it's going to be coming down and become a source of cash, but I'm going to pull up short of quantifying it for you."

Now it's a real step change in attitude, but they're still a ways from signing purchase orders and sanctioning these projects. So you go back a couple years ago in a $100 a barrel world, there were problems with returns, I think, on some of the deepwater developments. But frankly, I think less openness or less willingness on the part of our customers to consider sort of more radical or more revolutionary sort of approaches to changing how those projects are executed. The silver lining of a $50-barrel world has been -- we're now welcomed into those conversations with those customers. We're seeing our volume of engineering work, of FEED study-type work around these projects within our FPSO group rising. And that's good, but we're not yet to the point where our oil company customers are necessarily pulling the trigger and sanctioning these projects and moving forward. But the good news is, it all starts with kind of a reengineering, retooling, rescoping of these projects. You've heard of lots of examples in the E&P world that you referenced of oil companies taking out 20%, 25% out of their development costs by kind of resetting how they're going to execute these projects. I can only think that's probably helped in a lower day rate environment for rigs and a pretty hungry shipyard universe that can fabricate big steel structures for not much above cost these days. So that, I think, will all help the economics of the deepwater. But suffice to say, huge reserves discovered in the deepwater. A lot of smart people at the oil companies now with motivation to find new and better ways to develop those fields. And I think NOV is really well positioned to help them through, and we're very pleased at the progress that we have of -- in conversations with a few of those oil companies here through the last few quarters."

National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other items of $112 million pretax or $0.20 per share after tax. Excluding these, earnings were $0.61 per fully diluted share, down 21% from the second quarter of 2015 and down 62% from the third quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring and other items from all periods.
Third quarter 2015 revenues were $3.3 billion, down 15% from the second quarter 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $346 million or 10.5% of sales, and EBITDA was $511 million or 15.5% of sales, excluding restructuring and other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 18% from the second quarter to the third, as cost reductions across the organization helped minimize the margin impact from lower sequential volumes.
A second major decline in oil prices from the high-$50 range back into the low- to mid-$40 range since June has increased financial stress and led to a second round of rig activity reduction, sending the U.S. rig count down by almost 60% since late 2014 peaks. We expect to see further activity reductions and pricing pressures continuing into the fourth quarter. Visibility is limited. But we believe most producers will further reduce for 2016 CapEx plans after cutting spending significantly in 2015. The industry has not seen 2 years of declining CapEx since the 1980s, signaling the severity of the downturn we find ourselves in. We believe many, if not most, North American producers in OPEC countries are producing existing fields close to maximum levels, trying to offset lower revenues due to oil price declines with higher volumes while sharply reducing drilling activity.
OPEC and non-OPEC production are up year-over-year. This is not sustainable. Production will begin to decline naturally. And as it has begun to in the United States. And they're in light seats the recovery. However, with slow inventories, moderating demand growth with economic weakness in Asian and elsewhere around the globe and uncertain trajectory for incremental exports from I ran, we don't expect to recover anytime soon. Nevertheless, it will come, and our plan is to manage what we can namely costs through the downturn while continuing to position and strengthen our franchise through the inevitable upturn.
We expect to accomplish this through a combination of organic investment in new technologies and capabilities as well as extraordinary acquisition opportunities that we expect to emerge. For the first part of this downturn, we deployed $3 billion of capital into our share repurchase program returning 1 out of 8 shares over the past year while maintaining capital flexibility through our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. At the downturn has lengthened, we believe values of potential target companies will become more and more compelling. Thus far, it has been challenging to bring the bid and the of potential acquisitions into alignment. But we remain patient and disciplined in these discussions.
As we move into 2016, we believe sellers are likely to reduce their expectations and better capital returns on M&A will follow.
Consequently, our capital deployment strategy is shifting from share buybacks to an external focus on potential acquisitions. This is a sound capital deployment strategy that we will continue to execute in a disciplined way. NOV closed small 4 acquisitions during the third quarter of 2015. The strategic goal of these and other transactions will continue to focus on cultivating market leadership in selected subsectors within oilfield services and manufacturing. As we have said many times before, market leadership yields competitive advantage. Economies of scale, purposing leverage, the ability to leverage R&D and introduce new products to a larger revenue base, the more rapid accumulation of experience within the subsector, our global aftermarket support network, et cetera.
Our market positions make us a trusted, efficient, low-risk supplier to our customers. These are the types of opportunities that we look for. And the businesses we have built employing this strategy, our leaders in their respective fields. In short, NOV represents a portfolio of market leaders with the deepest experience and the most expertise.
Within these businesses, we have assembled discrete packages of equipment and services to drive higher efficiency in ways that our customers really want and in ways that really improve their businesses.
This means we take a view on where the logical boundaries of these packaged offerings should lie. Our acquisitions are enterprises where NOV can be a better owner to accelerate growth, drive efficiency and fully unlock their potential to create value for our customers and our shareholders. product groupings or packet boundaries rest on questions like what products have complex technical interfaces are difficult for our customers to manage? Interfaces where a single vendor can and should undertake interface management challenge. What proprietary technology can we build a logical package of products and services around? What trends do we see amongst customers as they all seek to reduce costs and risk around their operations? The development of our corporate strategies within our business units guides both our M&A strategy as well as our research and development strategy, both work in concert.
In the near term, we will continue to focus on managing costs to the marketplace, and our shallow decremental margins speak to the great job NOV's business unit managers have done in this effort. SG&A is down 34% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Rig Systems posted decremental leverage of 28% on a 23% sequential sales decline. Rig Aftermarket held operating profit flat despite unexpectedly high 13% revenue decline. Wellbore Technologies held decrementals to 21% despite a 13% sequential sales decline. And Completion & Production Solutions held detrimentals to 24% in the face of a 9% sales decline. I'm extraordinarily grateful to these business leaders who are skillfully reducing our capacity, managing costs and leading our core team through this challenging time. They're providing their teams with a vision of better days ahead to make sure that our the powerful to see the prosperity that will follow for NOV that's critical in the downturn.
We are fundamentally a service business even in our manufacturing units and ensuring our workforce continues with our long tradition of taking care of our customers and not getting distracted during stormy weather is critical. All of our employees to know that I am very proud of what you are doing.
Difficult market conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We supply highly capital-intensive industry and have benefited from decade-plus period of retooling, with improved levels of technology and automation. But industrial transformation is far from over. Our view is that we are currently in a cyclical pause. Recent oversupply of oil, exacerbated by weak economic demand growth, has demonstrated the power of newer, more capable rigs in completion equipment and techniques. During such a cyclical pause, our biggest competitor becomes the overhang product and consumables and equipment that our customers cannibalize extremely effectively in their Darwinian quest to preserve cash. The idle rigs and pressure-pumping fleets and wireline units and a myriad of other items we sell are being systematically stripped of spare parts and components to keep the much smaller fleet of units are remain on their contract working. This remains a highly capital equipment consumptive industry. The life expectancy of mechanical equipment is tied to the footage of drills or the volume of profit it pumps. The ability of the industry to increase borehole created per year are stages fracs per year. These are the physical consumption of mechanical equipment per year has also risen sharply, probably linearly. NOV will be called upon again to resume capitalizing in critical fleets of equipment required to supply a growing population with rising energy needs passed through the cyclical downturn. And as I said, we will emerge better and stronger.
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment held operating margins of nearly 8% despite a 9% sequential sales decline. The rig benefited from strong performance from our floating production unit and our flexible subsea pipeline unit in the quarter. We also posted good orders in the quarter, helped by a large deepwater flexible pipe order arising from our proprietary heated pipe solution. This resulted in an ending backlog level of $1.2 billion. We expect orders to decline in the fourth quarter as the market faces an overhang of fracture stimulation equipment across North America and as operators see no hurry to sanction any deepwater developments at the moment. Nevertheless, we are engaged in several FEED studies around the globe and meeting with a lot of operator interest and standardized more industrial efficient solutions to improve deepwater development economics. We of course by a handful of public statements from major oil companies on meaningful, double-digit cost reductions on deepwater projects, driven by the combination of design simplification, supplier participation and design and supply chain deflation. Fit-for-purpose solutions rather than ""perfect"" solutions. We continue to develop new products within the group in areas like composites, piping systems for corrosive produced fluids. In fact, we shipped our first string of spoolable composite pipe in the Saudi Arabian word. And we expect to install our first string of our proprietary smart pipe for shallow well dewatering in Australia in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, with 30%-plus declines in prices for steel pipe, have made steel pipe more competitive for composite pipe unit. However, as fields mature and water cuts rise, we expect our customers to gravitate to our corrosion-proof solutions.
We were also pleased to see higher sales in coiled tubing in the quarter on gains with key accounts and our new service center in the Northeast pulling sales through.
Our Wellbore Technologies group is driven by rig activity, and we're now facing a second rising wave of price pressure across all our products and services as rig activity declines. The saw demand for almost all of its products and services decline except for our IntelliServ wire drilled pipe technology, which has seen growing interest from operators in conjunction with our automated drilling solutions. This technology enables microsecond data from downhole sensors to control rig machinery, much more effectively than human drillers and increases rates of penetration significantly. We have several programs scheduled to spud with this later this year and into 2016 and are excited about the transformative capabilities of high-speed data from the bottom of the well.
New bid technologies we've introduced for helping drive market share gains, and we are pressing forward with new products in managed pressure drilling and wide catch fishing tool technologies. The operation of our test rig is helping accelerate time-to-market for many new products and new conditioning -- conditioned monitoring technologies.
We've seen our customers aggressively reposition and utilize their own fleets of equipment wherever possible to preserve cash, and our mix of drilling tools shift from sales to rentals as a result. The demand for drillpipe has been very weak as drillers cannibalize strings from idle rigs to support working rigs, but we have reduced capacity to match the current market.
Our Tuboscope unit has held up reasonably well as its work has shifted from drillpipe to leadpipe and tubing.
Rig Aftermarket segment declined 13% sequentially as more and more rigs went idle and became fresh sources of spare parts for their owners, driving sales and spare parts and manifolds lower. Nevertheless, the group held operating profit flat and operating margins increased 350 basis points.
We saw our count of SPS projects on offshore rigs flatten this quarter after increases through the first half as many plan for reactivation recertification programs are being shelved by drillers due to growing concerns about the near-term outlook for offshore rig demand. Nevertheless, SPS activity is up year-over-year, and we are also seeing rising inquiries around maintenance services we can provide on stack rigs.
Rig Systems demand remains weak overall, and we are downsizing to address this reality. We still see certain markets moving into the 21st century to employ proven technologies Argentina, the CIS, the Middle East, and we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities.
We also know many North American drillers continue to -- or plan to continue to high grade their fleets to AC Tier 1 capabilities once prosperity returns. in Rig Systems included land rigs for international markets and 2 jack-up packages. And we're up modestly from the second quarter, resulting in an ending backlog of $8 billion for the group. We expect orders to remain low through 2016 with scheduled outflows for backlog will be in the $2.4 billion range. Those are orders that are scheduled right now in the backlog. In certain instances, we continue to work with customers to systematically delay deliveries of rigs, which is improving our project margins as we were able to reduce overtime and source components more efficiently.
Brazilian rigs totaled $3 billion of the $8 billion in our September 30 backlog and accounted for only $53 million of revenues during the third quarter. As we reported previously, we have suspended our delay work on certain of these 22 rigs. Our shipyard customers are continuing to work with their customers set date to address overdue funding needs and future funding to move the projects forward. In the meantime, we are reducing costs in country.
Within Rig Systems, third quarter revenue is associated with new offshore rigs, both floaters and jack-ups totaled $860 million or 26% of consolidated revenues during the third quarter. While we expect some new specialized offshore rigs to be built by the industry over the next couple of years, we are developing -- and we are developing new designs and capabilities around these, we do not expect the level of building that we have seen over the past decade to resume for quite a while. Like many, we are waiting an increase in scrapping of older units across the fleet, which seems inevitable at this point.
Finally, I'm delighted to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Jose Byourgo to our team. Many of you know Jose from his time at Complete Production Services and more recently, at Continental Resources.
Let me turn it over to Jose to discuss our third quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Jose?"
31900,309461788,883539,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the se",2142,"Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the segment in the third quarter of 2014. Revenue out of backlog was $1.3 billion, down 24% sequentially, in line with total revenue for the segment. Revenues declined as we continued to adjust our project schedules and manage output to navigate effectively through fewer orders of lower backlog and customer requested delivery delays on certain projects.
For Q3, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 78% and 22%, respectively. Operating profit as adjusted for the reconciliations in our earnings release for the Rig Systems segment was $275 million, yielding operating margins of 18.4%, down 210 basis points from Q2. Decremental operating profit margins were 27.6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Low decremental margins demonstrate the effectiveness of our efforts to improve process efficiencies and resize the business to anticipated production levels. EBITDA was $300 million or 20.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 160 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015.
During the third quarter, we received $367 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 28%. Orders for the quarters were fairly evenly weighted across offshore and land and included 2 high-spec jack-up drilling equipment packages and 2, 3,000-horsepower land rigs for the Middle East.
FX adjustments at $77 million resulted in quarter ending backlog of $8 billion, down 11% sequentially, of which approximately 90% is offshore and 93% is destined for international markets.
We expect orders from subdued as activity continues to decline on land and offshore, and uncertainty regarding the timing of a recovery persists. We are seeing some demand for a few jack-ups from OCs and will opportunities for floaters are generally scarce, meaningful conversations on 20,000k psi floaters and other application-specific rigs continue.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect total Rig Systems revenue to decline approximately 10% into the $1.3 billion range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to about $1.1 billion as we see reductions in new order activity or through existing projects and work with customers to accommodate certain requests to extend delivery dates.
Resizing the business to reflect market activity remains critical to margin preservation, and we will continue to focus on cost-reduction opportunities, including process, efficiencies, tender pricing and facility consolidations to better align our resources with anticipated production levels. That said, cost control will not be enough to fully offset the impact of lower volumes, and we anticipate segment margins will decline into the mid-teens during the fourth quarter.
Despite the current challenges and customer capital constraints, longer-term fundamentals remain solid for our Rig Systems segment. Land rig customers continue to show a strong preference for rigs which utilize the latest technologies to most efficiently and precisely drill longer lateral wells from multi-well pads. And offshore exploration and production companies are committed to utilizing new rigs and equipment that enhance their ability to more safely and economically access hydrocarbons in increasingly challenging environments. NOV will continue to make long-term investments in the development of the best technological solutions that provide industry-leading quality and reliability to most effectively address the needs of our customers.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated revenues of $570 million during the third quarter of 2015, down 13% sequentially and down 32% year-over-year, driven by lower spare part sales as drilling contractors continue to focus on reducing their expenditures amid activity declines. The reduction in spare parts sales was partially offset by a slight increase in service-related work. Despite the low-teens revenue decline, the segment maintained flat operating profit at $146 million, resulting in operating margins of 25.6%, a 350 basis point improvement sequentially due to effective cost controls and inventory charges incurred in the second quarter, which did not repeat.
EBITDA was $154 million or 27% of sales, consistent with second quarter, land-related sales were approximately 22% of total segment revenues. Near term, we expect the segment will continue to ebb and flow as our customers try to identify the bottom of this current cycle. As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the pickup in service and repair revenue we have seen the last quarter of prior years will be much more modest this year as uncertainty leads to more cautionary spending by our customers. However, we do anticipate Rig Aftermarket revenues will be up slightly in comparison to Q3.
Operating margins are expected to be similar to the third quarter as increases resulting from incremental revenues will be offset by product mix. In our rig businesses, we distinguish ourselves through service after sale. We are committed to the success of our customers and driven by a sense of urgency in maintaining and supporting our equipment and technology in the field.
The capabilities of our global service network are unrivaled. The mid- to long-term outlook for the Rig Aftermarket segment remains bright, and we anticipate sales will begin to improve as soon as customers worked through their limited existing inventories for spare parts. We also anticipate the improvement will accelerate once overall industry activity levels begin to increase, causing a rush to return sub-optimally maintain stock and partially cannibalized rigs to cover operating conditions.
For the third quarter of 2015, Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $834 million, down 13% sequentially and down 43% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Almost all business units within the segment were impacted by the overall decrease in drilling activity levels with production-oriented businesses realizing slightly better performance.
Customer interest continues to grow in our technologically advanced products and services, which reduce drill times and lower operating cost such as our tectonic drillbits, connection drilling, performance software and our soft speeds fixed prevention services. One of our tectonic bits was recently paired with our motor, an agitated drill system to drill a 2.5-mile long lateral in the Bakken in what we and our customer believe to be a record time of 4.5 days.
Operating profit for the third quarter was $22 million or 2.6% of sales, down 230 basis points from last quarter. Sequential decrementals were limited to 20.5% as we continue to focus on expense reduction and process efficiencies to develop a leaner cost structure for the business.  Q3 EBITDA was $119 million or 14.3% of revenue.
Looking into the fourth quarter of 2015, many of our North American customers are bracing for a further fall off in activity during what they anticipate will be a prolonged year-end holiday slowdown. Fewer rigs running will result in weaker demand for Wellbore Technologies products and services, and we are seeing a new wave of pricing pressure, which may offset our cost-reduction efforts. As such, we believe revenues in our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline in the mid- to high single-percentage range with decremental margins in the mid-20s. Longer term, we anticipate continued market share gains from our advanced product and services designed to enable the drilling of more complex productive and safer wells at a faster rate, thereby enhancing the economics. We believe our strategy to help our customers to achieve their objectives in succeeding and we will continue to invest in solutions our customers value today and which will further enhance our position for the potential recovery.
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $798 million for the third quarter 2015, down 9% sequentially and 33% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Revenues declined across most businesses on lower backlogs and customers delaying pickup of finished work with some offset coming from higher sales, floating production equipment and flexible pipe. We also saw increased coiled tubing sales as our investments in placing tubing centers closer to our customers' operations enable us to provide better service. Operating profit for the segment was $63 million, resulting in operating margins of 7.9%, down 140 basis points sequentially and 750 basis points year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 24% and third quarter EBITDA for that segment was $117 million or 14.7% of sales. Operating margins were negatively impacted by volume, pricing pressure and product mix, but most cost-control initiatives helped to offset some of the margin decline, resulting in improved decrementals versus prior quarters.
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for the Completion & Production Solutions. The third quarter saw a much improved order intake of $467 million. That's an increase of $212 million or 83% sequentially, led by improved bookings for floating production relating -- related equipment and fiberglass pipe as well as a large order for subsidy flexible pipe. We recognized $472 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 99%. Of the $1.2 billion backlog at quarter-end, approximately 76% is offshore and 86% is international.
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate demand for the new pressure pumping and coiled tubing units, especially in North America, will remain low. And while customer interest remains elevated for NOV's more cost-effective solutions in the FPSO space, near term, we anticipate a general slowing in prospect development due to the current commodity price environment. We believe revenues will decrease by a mid-single digit percentage and expect revenue out of backlog to remain in the $450 million to $470 million range. Margins should move down slightly on lower volumes.
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the third quarter, gross margin declined 110 basis points to 21.2%. SG&A decreased 15% or $63 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. Other items of $112 million for the quarter resulted primarily from a $55 million pretax intangible asset impairment as well as a $57 million pretax charges associated with severance facility closures and other costs.
Equity income fell to breakeven as demand for OCTGs or green tube associated with our Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drillpipe. Other expense for the quarter decreased $10 million sequentially to $20 million, due primarily to a reduction in foreign exchange-related losses relative to the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.8%, down from the 26.9% rate posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Excluding the impact of $112 million and other items, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%, reflective of the continuing high mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions.  EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding other items, was $511 million or 15.5% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.9 billion at September 30, 2015, down $206 million or 3% sequentially. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of $222 million reduction in inventory levels, $151 million reduction in accounts receivable and $88 million increase in accrued taxes and the $10 million decrease in customer financings, which is the net of prepayments and billings in excess of costs against cost in excess of buildings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. While we were pleased to see working capital decrease and we anticipate the pace of cash flow generation from working capital will increase as we move forward, we continue to manage several items impacting it our efforts to reduce the capital employed in our business, including in-sourcing of machining hours, which increases our inventory by bringing in raw materials, which otherwise would have been held by third-party vendors, customers looking to delay equipment deliveries and extend payment terms and our Rig Systems backlog and its associated customer financings.
Regarding the financings. As projects approach their completion, we do anticipate spread between prepayments of cost in excess of billings to narrow, further contributing to a future reduction of working capital. For the quarter, the company generated $410 million in cash flow from operations. Offsetting this cash flow were share repurchases of $444 million, dividend payments of $174 million, investments in our business of $124 million and FX impact or cash balances and other items totaling $44 million. The net impact of our cash flow for the quarter was a $376 million increase in net debt. However, total debt decreased $322 million as we successfully repatriated $1.1 billion to the U.S. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net-to-debt capitalization was 11.8%. While we remain focused on managing costs and improving efficiencies, we believe the strength of our enterprise uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on compelling acquisition opportunities that will emerge in this downturn and to continue investing in the development of technologies that will help our customers improve their economics.
With that, we'd like to turn it open to questions."

And then beyond that, the great thing about oilfield services is it's composed of dozens and dozens and dozens of interesting subsectors. And so we're continually looking across those for opportunities to deploy capital and develop our business. We also have some great industrial product lines and businesses in markets that we serve. Usually, those are characterized by some sort of overlapping confidence that we have in the oilfield. We make a product, for instance, the oilfield also goes into other industrial segment. So usually, there's some sort of overlap or synergy that's embedded in those sort of opportunities. But yes, we're taking a very expansive view. The reason for the comments, obviously, is a lot of parts of -- well, really all parts of oilfield services and manufacturing under stress in the current environment. And the landscape shifting, and so at the low points in the cycles where we frequently see the best opportunities. And as you know, we have a long history of executing acquisitions.

And we always reach out our customers to kind of get there guidance. And what we're finding is they don't know what they're going to spend. So generally, though, I think the first part of 2016 is going to continue to be really challenging. As I said in my prepared remarks, our expectations and activities is going to trend lower. I think that everybody mentioned, we remain hopeful to get a little bit of commodity price help and relief and maybe the second half of the year. We start to see maybe activity pick up a little bit it. But I don't have a lot of data to point to as to why that would happen. Jose and I were chatting earlier and Jose, you mentioned the fact that producers, a lot of pressure facing production declines. And so I think there'll be an impetus at least across North America to get back to drilling as soon as they can. Take a while but a lot of the equipment that's out there has been depleted of spare parts and cannibalized, and so a little bit of uptick in activity is going to take a lot of work from NOV. So we're looking forward to that time."

But yes, that's our business that makes drillpipe for the rest of you. And what we see is particularly onshore operators moving drillpipe off of idle rigs and moving that onto the rigs that remain working. So a little more challenging offshore. It's expensive to demobilize a string of pipe off of an offshore rigs. So a little less impacted from cannibalization here. But certainly, onshore, that's impacted them. The good news is that their mix has improved. We're the market leader in terms of providing premium connections of high tensile strength pipe set new records in places like Soccer Island in terms of extended rigs drilling out 7, 8 miles and really, broadly speaking, you step back and view this the demand for drillpipe a lot of technology in drillpipe and drillpipe is consumed at a much faster rate used to drill these horizontal wells really making the shale place go. So yes, we're in this period when demand is down. Teams are in great job managing through it.

And I tried to touch on this in my opening remarks. The principles that we apply. Since I've been with the company, we've grown from 2 business units to 15 and our reiterate we take a broad view across oilfield services and look for opportunities to deploy capital, develop strategies around things. I'll go back a couple of years and give you a real world example. We launched an FPSO initiative about 4, 5 years ago, and I'll just point out, this was long before anybody was talking about the standardization, about industrialization supply chain they were sort of on the subject. But we recognized NOV has built and installed commission 300 complicated offshore rigs. We work with every major shipyard out there. We've got great project management expertise, great relationships with every major shipyard around the globe and you've seen shipyards their customers are very challenge when it comes to building FPSO vessels on time, on budget. Plus, when we look at our portfolio product offerings between the offloading systems, cranes, composite piping, production chokes and valves and manifolds and other things, we had a lot of content with FPSO. So we've cultivated an FPSO strategy and said, we have specific -- we're uniquely positioned in terms of our shipyard expertise to execute a strategy of improving FPSO construction, bringing more industrially elegant solutions to the supply chain against simplifying. The things that you're hearing a lot more lately to reduce cost and risk around FPSO construction. And NOV is uniquely positioned with regards to a vessel strategy in the deepwater. And then we've supplemented that with acquisitions along the way, including APL systems, one of the 3 global providers of turret mooring systems service pack technologies with fixable, which is now NOV Flexibles, 1 of the 3 global providers of flexible pipe, a big component of surf packages that sort of fit the strategy. So that's an example of where we're deploying capital execute a strategy that, I think, has positioned us to be transformative in a significant sector in oilfield services and thereby reduce cost for our customers. So that's an example the kind of things that we're looking at. And suffice to say in a cyclical downturn, we're continuing to look for other opportunities to deploy capital and develop businesses."

And unfortunately, it's driven by rig count and really, the inverse of rig counts, which is stacked rigs. Because the stacked rigs as activity goes down, then it frees up a string of drillpipe, it frees up the downhole tools working on that networking rig. And so it's very fluid and very difficult to tell frankly, until we have bottomed on it activity. And we see a little time passed beyond that. Very difficult to tell kind of where that's going to lie. We're seeing customers be far more aggressive, I think, in this downturn with regards to cannibalizing their equipment about repositioning it. They're getting -- they have a particular piece of equipment in a different region there's a cost to repositioning. There's freight. They have to invest and just to move it. And maybe to get it back to working order. And we're seeing customers go to more extraordinary length, I think, in this downturn we have in the appreciating couple of downturns with regards to cannibalization. So there's a very, very very Darwinian, very Draconian move to preserve cash and use what's on hand. And so we're seeing that. We do know it will turn around and when it does, one day the phones will light up and people will also need it yesterday. And so that's the other side of this.

Second, as I mentioned, we have outsourcing model in good times and have done a great job scaling back our outside suppliers about insourcing or in managing to the volume that's out there. Third, as backlog moves down, there's more flexibility that opens up with regards to steps that they can take. Absorption does become harder, I think, from here on out. And then fourth, I think the wildcard out there sort of remains pricing to some degree, kind of where that lands. So I think it's very difficult. I think if you're looking to the margin number a range right now other than as he said many times before you manage what we can and managed to the market. May be helpful to point out that our global network within rig of plans and facilities really serve both Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket the same plants that make components for rigs also make spare parts. And these components are used both offshore and on land. And between Rig Aftermarket continuing demand and ongoing work and ongoing demand for components to replace things that are worn out, things that are burned up to upgrade rigs. Even in the downturn you're going to see rigs that need to upgrade even in order to qualify for certain work. I think we can keep a decent load on our plants in our core team through that. So that's kind of what we're shifting to as slow down a little bit. The other part that I'm probably more optimistic about in terms of demand in rig is we know a number of drilling contractors in North America and around the globe who are completely bought into the idea and the need to upgrade their fleets to AC technology. This is clearly where the market is going. And so I think in terms of recovery, that's where we would see it next."

National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and othe",2381,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other items of $112 million pretax or $0.20 per share after tax. 
Excluding these, earnings were $0.61 per fully diluted share, down 21% from the second quarter of 2015 and down 62% from the third quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring and other items from all periods.
Third quarter 2015 revenues were $3.3 billion, down 15% from the second quarter 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $346 million or 10.5% of sales, and EBITDA was $511 million or 15.5% of sales, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Decremental operating leverage was 18% from the second quarter to the third, as cost reductions across the organization helped minimize the margin impact from lower sequential volumes.
A second major decline in oil prices from the high-$50 range back into the low to mid-$40 range since June has increased financial stress and led to a second round of rig activity reduction, sending the U.S. rig count down by almost 60% since late 2014 peaks. 
We expect to see further activity reductions and pricing pressures continuing into the fourth quarter. Visibility is limited, but we believe most producers will further reduce for 2016 CapEx plans after cutting spending significantly in 2015. 
The industry has not seen 2 years of declining CapEx since the 1980s, signaling the severity of the downturn we find ourselves in. We believe many, if not most, North American producers in OPEC countries are producing existing fields close to maximum levels, trying to offset lower revenues due to oil price declines with higher volumes while sharply reducing drilling activity.
OPEC and non-OPEC production are up year-over-year. This is not sustainable. Production will begin to decline naturally as it has begun to in the United States, and therein lies the seeds for a recovery. 
However, with swollen inventories moderating demand growth with economic weakness in Asia and elsewhere around the globe and an uncertain trajectory for incremental oil exports from Iran, we don't expect to recover anytime soon. 
Nevertheless, it will come, and our plan is to manage what we can namely costs through the downturn while continuing to position and strengthen our franchise for the inevitable upturn.
We expect to accomplish this through a combination of organic investment in new technologies and capabilities as well as extraordinary acquisition opportunities that we expect to emerge. 
Through the first part of this downturn, we deployed $3 billion of capital into our share repurchase program returning 1 out of 8 shares over the past year, while maintaining capital flexibility through our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. 
As the downturn has lengthened, we believe values of potential target companies will become more and more compelling. Thus far, it has been challenging to bring the bid and the ask on potential acquisitions into alignment, but we remain patient and disciplined in these discussions.
As we move into 2016, we believe sellers are likely to reduce their expectations and better capital returns on M&A will follow.
Consequently, our capital deployment strategy is shifting from share buybacks to an external focus on potential acquisitions. This is a sound capital deployment strategy that we will continue to execute in a disciplined way. 
NOV closed small 4 acquisitions during the third quarter of 2015. The strategic goal of these and other transactions will continue to focus on cultivating market leadership in selected subsectors within oilfield services and manufacturing. 
As we have said many times before, market leadership yields competitive advantage, economies of scale, purchasing leverage, the ability to leverage R&D and introduce new products through a larger revenue base, the more rapid accumulation of experience within the subsector, our global aftermarket support network, et cetera.
Our market positions make us a trusted, efficient, low-risk supplier to our customers. These are the types of opportunities that we look for, and the businesses we have built employing this strategy, are leaders in their respective fields. In short, NOV represents a portfolio of market leaders with the deepest experience and the most expertise.
Within these businesses, we have assembled discrete packages of equipment and services to drive higher efficiency in ways that our customers really want and in ways that really improve their businesses.
This means we take a view on where the logical boundaries of these packaged offerings should lie. Our acquisitions of enterprises where NOV can be a better owner to accelerate growth, drive efficiency and fully unlock their potential to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
This view on product groupings or packaged boundaries rest on questions like what products have complex technical interfaces that are difficult for our customers to manage? Interfaces where a single vendor can and should undertake the interface management challenge. What proprietary technology can we build a logical package of products and services around? What trends do we see amongst customers as they all seek to reduce costs and risk around their operations? The development of our corporate strategies within our business units guides both our M&A strategy as well as our research and development strategy, both work in concert.
In the near term, we will continue to focus on managing costs to the marketplace, and our shallow decremental margins speak to the great job NOV's business unit managers have done in this effort. 
SG&A is down 34% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Rig Systems posted decremental leverage of 28% on a 23% sequential sales decline. Rig Aftermarket held operating profit flat despite an unexpectedly high 13% revenue decline. 
Wellbore Technologies held decrementals to 21% despite a 13% sequential sales decline. And Completion & Production Solutions held decrementals to 24% in the face of a 9% sales decline. I'm extraordinarily grateful to these business leaders who are skillfully reducing our capacity, managing costs and leading our core team through this challenging time. They are providing their teams with a vision of better days ahead to make sure that our folks see the prosperity that will follow for NOV that's critical in the downturn.
We are fundamentally a service business even in our manufacturing units, and ensuring our workforce continues with a long tradition of taking care of our customers and not getting distracted during stormy weather is critical. I want all of our employees to know that I am very proud of what you are doing.
Difficult market conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We supply highly capital-intensive industry and have benefited from decade-plus period of retooling, with improved levels of technology and automation. But the industrial transformation is far from over. Our view is that we are currently in a cyclical pause. Recent oversupply of oil, exacerbated by weak economic demand growth, has demonstrated the power of newer, more capable rigs in completion equipment and techniques. 
During such a cyclical pause, our biggest competitor becomes the overhang products and consumables and equipment that our customers cannibalize extremely effectively in their Darwinian quest to preserve cash. The idled rigs and pressure-pumping fleets and wireline units and a myriad of other items we sell are being systematically stripped of spare parts and components to keep the much smaller fleet of units that remain under contract working. 
This remains a highly capital equipment-consumptive industry. The life expectancy of mechanical equipment is tied to the footage it drills or the volume of profit it pumps, the ability of the industry to increase borehole created per year or stages fracked per year, means that the physical consumption of mechanical equipment per year has also risen sharply, probably linearly. NOV will be called upon again to resume capitalizing the critical fleets of equipment required to supply a growing population with rising energy needs as we pass through this cyclical downturn. And as I said, we will emerge better and stronger.
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment held operating margins of nearly 8% despite a 9% sequential sales decline. The group benefited from strong performance from our floating production unit and our flexible subsea pipe unit in the quarter. 
We also posted good orders in the quarter, helped by a large deepwater flexible pipe order arising from our proprietary heated pipe solution. This resulted in an ending backlog level of $1.2 billion. 
We expect orders to decline in the fourth quarter as the market faces an overhang of fracture stimulation equipment across North America, and as operators seem in no hurry to sanction any deepwater developments at the moment. Nevertheless, we are engaged in several FEED studies around the globe and meeting with lot of operator interest in standardized more industrial-efficient solutions to improve deepwater development economics. 
We're encouraged by a handful of public statements from major oil companies on meaningful, double-digit cost reductions on deepwater projects, driven by the combination of design simplification, supplier participation and design and supply chain deflation, fit-for-purpose solutions rather than ""perfect"" solutions. 
We continue to develop new products within the group in areas like composites, spoolable, piping systems for corrosive-produced fluids. In fact, we shipped our first string of spoolable composite pipe into Saudi Arabia this quarter. And we expect to install our first string of our proprietary smart pipe for shallow well dewatering in Australia in the fourth quarter. 
Nevertheless, with 30%-plus declines in prices for steel pipe, have made steel pipe more competitive for composite pipe unit. However, as fields mature and water cuts rise, we expect our customers to gravitate to our corrosion-proof solutions.
We were also pleased to see higher sales in coiled tubing in the quarter on gains with key accounts and our new service center in the Northeast pulling sales through.
Our Wellbore Technologies group is driven by rig activity, and we're now facing a second rising wave of price pressure across all our products and services as rig activity declines. The group saw demand for almost all of its products and services decline except for our IntelliServ Wired Drilled Pipe technology, which has seen growing interest from operators in conjunction with our automated drilling solutions. 
This technology enables microsecond data from downhole sensors to control rig machinery, much more effectively than human drillers and increases rates of penetration significantly. We have several programs scheduled to spud with this later this year and into 2016 and are excited about the transformative capabilities of high-speed data from the bottom of the well.
New bid technologies we've introduced for helping drive market share gains, and we are pressing forward with new products in managed pressure drilling and wide catch fishing tool technologies. The operation of our test rig is helping accelerate time-to-market for many new products and new conditioning -- conditioned monitoring technologies.
We've seen our customers aggressively reposition and utilize their own fleets of equipment wherever possible to preserve cash, and our mix of drilling tools shift from sales to rentals as a result. The demand for drill pipe has been very weak as drillers cannibalize strings from idled rigs to support working rigs, but we have reduced capacity to match the current market.
Our Tuboscope unit has held up reasonably well as its work has shifted from drill pipe to line pipe and tubing.
Rig Aftermarket segment declined 13% sequentially as more and more rigs went idle and became fresh sources of spare parts for their owners, driving sales in spare parts and manifolds lower. Nevertheless, the group held operating profit flat and operating margins increased 350 basis points.
We saw our account of SPS projects on offshore rigs flatten this quarter after increases through the first half as many planned for reactivation recertification programs are being shelved by drillers due to growing concerns about the near-term outlook for offshore rig demand. Nevertheless, SPS activity is up year-over-year, and we are also seeing rising inquiries around maintenance services we can provide on stack rigs.
Rig Systems demand remains weak overall, and we are downsizing to address this reality. We still see certain markets moving into the 21st century to employ proven technologies: Argentina, the CIS, the Middle East, and we're aggressively pursuing these opportunities.
We also know many North American drillers continue to -- or plan to continue to high grade their fleets to AC Tier 1 capabilities once prosperity returns. Origin Rig Systems included land rigs for international markets and 2 jack-up packages. And we're up modestly from the second quarter, resulting in an ending backlog of $8 billion for the group. 
We expect orders to remain low through 2016 when scheduled outflows from backlog will be in the $2.4 billion range. Those are orders that are scheduled right now in the backlog. In certain instances, we continue to work with customers to systematically delay deliveries of rigs, which is improving our project margins as we were able to reduce overtime and source components more efficiently.
Brazilian rigs totaled $3 billion of the $8 billion in our September 30 backlog and accounted for only $53 million of revenues during the third quarter. As we reported previously, we have suspended our delayed work on certain of these 22 rigs. Our shipyard customers are continuing to work with their customers at Sete to address overdue funding needs and future funding to move the projects forward. In the meantime, we are reducing costs in country.
Within Rig Systems, third quarter revenue is associated with new offshore rigs. Both floaters and jack-ups totaled $860 million or 26% of consolidated revenues during the third quarter. While we expect some new specialized offshore rigs to be built by the industry over the next couple of years, we are developing -- and we are developing new designs and capabilities around these, we do not expect the level of building that we have seen over the past decade to resume for quite a while. Like many, we are waiting an increase in scrapping of older units across the fleet, which seems inevitable at this point.
Finally, I'm delighted to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Jose Bayardo, to our team. Many of you know Jose from his time at Complete Production Services, and more recently at Continental Resources.
Let me turn it over to Jose to discuss our third quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Jose?"
31900,309461788,883851,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the",2142,"Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the segment in the third quarter of 2014. Revenue out of backlog was $1.3 billion, down 24% sequentially, in line with total revenue for the segment. Revenues declined as we continued to adjust to our project schedules and manage output to navigate effectively through fewer orders of lower backlog and customer requested delivery delays on certain projects.
For Q3, the split between offshore- and land-related revenue was 78% and 22%, respectively. Operating profit as adjusted for the reconciliations in our earnings release for the Rig Systems segment was $275 million, yielding operating margins of 18.4%, down 210 basis points from Q2. 
Decremental operating profit margins were 27.6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Low decremental margins demonstrate the effectiveness of our efforts to improve process efficiencies and resize the business to anticipated production levels. EBITDA was $300 million or 20.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 160 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015.
During the third quarter, we received $367 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 28%. Orders for the quarter were fairly evenly weighted across offshore and land and included 2 high-spec jack-up drilling equipment packages and 2,000, 3,000-horsepower land rigs for the Middle East.
FX adjustments of $77 million resulted in quarter ending backlog of $8 billion, down 11% sequentially, of which approximately 90% is offshore and 93% is destined for international markets.
We expect orders to remain subdued as activity continues to decline on land and offshore, and uncertainty regarding the timing of a recovery persists. We are seeing some demand for a few jack-ups from NOCs and while opportunities for floaters are generally scarce, meaningful conversations on 20,000k psi floaters and other application-specific rigs continue.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect total Rig Systems revenue to decline approximately 10% into the $1.3 billion range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to about $1.1 billion as we see reductions in new order activity or through existing projects and work with customers to accommodate certain requests to extend delivery dates.
Resizing the business to reflect market activity remains critical to margin preservation, and we will continue to focus on cost-reduction opportunities, including process, efficiencies, vendor pricing and facility consolidations to better align our resources with anticipated production levels. That said, cost control will not be enough to fully offset the impact of lower volumes, and we anticipate segment margins will decline into the mid-teens during the fourth quarter.
Despite the current challenges and customer capital constraints, longer-term fundamentals remain solid for our Rig Systems segment. Land rig customers continue to show a strong preference for rigs which utilize the latest technologies to most efficiently and precisely drill longer lateral wells from multi-well pads. 
And offshore exploration and production companies are committed to utilizing new rigs and equipment that enhance their ability to more safely and economically access hydrocarbons in increasingly challenging environments. NOV will continue to make long-term investments in the development of the best technological solutions that provide industry-leading quality and reliability to most effectively address the needs of our customers.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated revenues of $570 million during the third quarter of 2015, down 13% sequentially and down 32% year-over-year, driven by lower spare part sales as drilling contractors continue to focus on reducing their expenditures amid activity declines. 
The reduction in spare part sales was partially offset by a slight increase in service-related work. Despite the low-teens revenue decline, the segment maintained flat operating profit at $146 million, resulting in operating margins of 25.6%, a 350-basis-point improvement sequentially, due to effective cost controls and inventory charges incurred in the second quarter, which did not repeat.
EBITDA was $154 million or 27% of sales. Consistent with second quarter, land-related sales were approximately 22% of total segment revenues. Near term, we expect the segment will continue to ebb and flow as our customers try to identify the bottom of this current cycle. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the pickup in service and repair revenue we have seen the last quarter of prior years will be much more modest this year as uncertainty leads to more cautionary spending by our customers. However, we do anticipate Rig Aftermarket revenues will be up slightly in comparison to Q3.
Operating margins are expected to be similar to the third quarter as increases resulting from incremental revenues will be offset by product mix. In our rig businesses, we distinguish ourselves through service after sale. We are committed to the success of our customers and driven by a sense of urgency in maintaining and supporting our equipment and technology in the field.
The capabilities of our global service network are unrivaled. The mid- to long-term outlook for the Rig Aftermarket segment remains bright, and we anticipate sales will begin to improve as soon as customers work through their limited existing inventories of spare parts. We also anticipate the improvement will accelerate once overall industry activity levels begin to increase, causing a rush to return sub-optimally maintained stacked and partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating conditions.
For the third quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $834 million, down 13% sequentially and down 43% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Almost all business units within the segment were impacted by the overall decrease in drilling activity levels with production-oriented businesses realizing slightly better performance.
Customer interest continues to grow in our technologically advanced products and services, which reduce drill times and lower operating costs such as our tectonic drill bits, connection drilling performance software and our SoftSpeed stick-slip prevention services. One of our tectonic bits was recently paired with our HellCat motor, an Agitator drill system to drill a 2.5-mile long lateral in the Bakken in what we and our customer believe to be a record time of 4.5 days.
Operating profit for the third quarter was $22 million or 2.6% of sales, down 230 basis points from last quarter. Sequential decrementals were limited to 20.5% as we continue to focus on expense reduction and process efficiencies to develop a leaner cost structure for the business. Q3 EBITDA was $119 million or 14.3% of revenue.
Looking into the fourth quarter of 2015, many of our North American customers are bracing for a further fall-off in activity during what they anticipate will be a prolonged year-end holiday slowdown. Fewer rigs running will result in weaker demand for Wellbore Technologies' products and services, and we are seeing a new wave of pricing pressure, which may offset our cost-reduction efforts. 
As such, we believe revenues in our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline in the mid- to high single-percentage range with decremental margins in the mid-20s. Longer term, we anticipate continued market share gains from our advanced products and services designed to enable the drilling of more complex productive and safer wells at a faster rate, thereby enhancing the economics. 
We believe our strategy to help our customers achieve their objectives in succeeding and we will continue to invest in solutions our customers value today and which will further enhance our position for eventual recovery.
Our Completions & Productions Solutions segment generated revenues of $798 million for the third quarter 2015, down 9% sequentially and 33% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Revenues declined across most businesses on lower backlogs and customers delaying pickup of finished work with some offset coming from higher sales, floating production-related equipment and flexible pipe. 
We also saw increased coiled tubing sales as our investments in placing tubing centers closer to our customers' operations enable us to provide better service. Operating profit for the segment was $63 million, resulting in operating margins of 7.9%, down 140 basis points sequentially and 750 basis points year-over-year. 
Sequential decrementals were 24% and third quarter EBITDA for the segment was $117 million or 14.7% of sales. Operating margins were negatively impacted by volume, pricing pressure and product mix, but most cost-control initiatives helped to offset some of the margin decline, resulting in improved decrementals versus prior quarters.
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for the Completion & Production Solutions. The third quarter saw a much improved order intake of $467 million. That's an increase of $212 million or 83% sequentially, led by improved bookings for floating production relating -- related equipment and fiberglass pipe as well as a large order for subsea flexible pipe. 
We recognized $472 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 99%. Of the $1.2 billion backlog at quarter end, approximately 76% is offshore and 86% is international.
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate demand for our new pressure pumping and coiled tubing unit, especially in North America, will remain low. And while customer interest remains elevated for NOV's more cost-effective solutions in the FPSO space, near term, we anticipate a general slowing in prospect development due to the current commodity price environment. 
We believe revenues will decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage and expect revenue out of backlog to remain in the $450 million to $470 million range. Margins should move down slightly on lower volumes.
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the third quarter, gross margin declined 110 basis points to 21.2%. SG&A decreased 15% or $63 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. 
Other items of $112 million for the quarter resulted primarily from a $55 million pretax intangible asset impairment as well as a $57 million pretax charges associated with severance facility closures and other costs.
Equity income fell to breakeven as demand for OCTGs or green tube associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drill pipe. Other expense for the quarter decreased $10 million sequentially to $20 million, due primarily to a reduction in foreign exchange-related losses relative to the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.8%, down from the 26.9% rate posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Excluding the impact of $112 million in other items, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%, reflective of the continuing high mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions. EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding other items, was $511 million or 15.5% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.9 billion at September 30, 2015, down $206 million or 3% sequentially. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of $222 million reduction in inventory levels, $151 million reduction in accounts receivable and $88 million increase in accrued taxes and the $10 million decrease in customer financings, which is the net of prepayments and billings in excess of costs against cost in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While we were pleased to see total working capital decrease and we anticipate the pace of cash flow generation from working capital will increase as we move forward, we continue to manage several items impacting our efforts to reduce the capital employed in our business, including in-sourcing of machining hours, which increases our inventory by bringing in raw materials, which otherwise would have been held by third-party vendors, customers looking to delay equipment deliveries and extend payment terms and our Rig Systems backlog and its associated customer financings.
Regarding the financings. As projects approach their completion, we do anticipate spread between prepayments, cost and excess of billings to narrow, further contributing to the future reduction of working capital. 
For the quarter, the company generated $410 million in cash flow from operations. Offsetting this cash flow were share repurchases of $444 million, dividend payments of $174 million, investments in our business of $124 million and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $44 million. 
The net impact of our cash flow for the quarter was a $376 million increase in net debt. However, total debt decreased $322 million as we successfully repatriated $1.1 billion to the U.S. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net-to-debt capitalization was 11.8%. 
While we remain focused on managing costs and improving efficiencies, we believe the strength of our enterprise uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on compelling acquisition opportunities that will emerge in this downturn and to continue investing in the development of technologies that will help our customers improve their economics.
With that, we'd like to turn it open to questions."

We report 4 reporting segments and those were comprised really of 15 business units that make those up. And I would say all 15, we continually look for opportunities to enhance and expand. And then beyond that, the great thing about oilfield services is it's composed of dozens and dozens and dozens of interesting subsectors, and so we're continually looking across those for opportunities to deploy capital and develop our business. We also have some great industrial product lines and businesses in markets that we serve. Usually, those are characterized by some sort of overlapping confidence that we have in the oilfield. We make a product, for instance, if the oilfield needs it, it also goes into other industrial segments. So usually, there's some sort of overlap or synergy that's embedded in those sort of opportunities. But yes, we're taking a very extensive view. The reason for the comments, obviously, is a lot of parts of -- well, really all parts of oilfield services and manufacturing under stress in the current environment and the landscape shifting, and so at the low points in the cycles where we frequently see the best opportunities. And as you know, we have a long history of executing acquisitions. And both National Oilwell and Varco came out of private equity roots. And through the years, between our 2 organizations, we came together about 10 years ago, we've done probably in excess of 300 transactions. So this is becoming a buyer's market, and we're pretty excited about that."

As Jose mentioned, it takes a little more inventory to accomplish. On the fuel cost front, it varies by product line. We've seen dramatic deflation in pipe prices, for instance. On castings and forgings, yes, I think we're seeing the same thing others are, which is a little less deflation. But really across the entire supplier network, we're pressing for lower pricing and continually trying to become more efficient."

We're doing more detailed planning around what 2016 is going to look like, and we always reach out our customers to kind of get their guidance. And what we're finding is they don't know what they're going to spend. So generally, though, I think the first part of 2016 is going to continue to be really challenging. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our expectation is activity is going to trend lower. I think like everybody in this industry that we remain hopeful we'll get a little bit of commodity price help and relief and then maybe the second half of the year, we start to see maybe activity pick up a little bit. But I don't have a lot of data to point to as to why that won't happen. Jose and I were chatting earlier. And Jose, you mentioned the fact that producers come under a lot of pressure when they start facing production declines. And so I think there'll be an impetus at least across North America to get back to drilling as soon as they can. Of course, that will take a while. A lot of the equipment that's out there has been depleted of spare parts and cannibalized, and so a little bit of uptick in activity is going to take a lot of work from NOV. So we're looking forward to that time."

That's -- that business is certainly under a lot of pressure and the management team there has done a great job scaling back to match the market and holding as best they can. But yes, that's our business that makes drill pipe for the rest of you. And what we see is particularly onshore operators moving drill pipe off of idled rigs and moving that onto the rigs that remain working. It's a little more challenging offshore. It's expensive to demobilize a string of pipe off of an offshore rig, so a little less impacted from cannibalization there, but certainly, onshore, that's impacted them. The good news is that their mix has improved. We're the market leader in terms of providing premium connections of high tensile strength pipe, set new records in places like Sukkwan Island in terms of extended rigs drilling out 7, 8 miles. And really, broadly speaking, you step back and view this -- the demand for drill pipe a lot of technology in drill pipe, and drill pipe is consumed at a much faster rate when it's used to drill these horizontal wells, these long patterns that's really making the shale plays go. So yes, we're in this period when demand is down. Teams has done a great job. They are managing through it. But once we recover, I think a shale phenomenon is going to continue to consume more and more drill pipe that we make."

But -- and I tried to touch on this in my opening remarks, the principles that we apply. Since I've been with the company, we've grown from 2 business units to 15, and I reiterate we take a broad view across oilfield services and look for opportunities to deploy capital and develop strategies around things. I'll go back a couple of years and give you a real world example. We launched an FPSO initiative about 4, 5 years ago. And I'll just point out, this is long before anybody was talking about standardization, about industrial efficient supply chain when were sort of a lone voice on this subject. But we recognized NOV has built, installed and commissioned 300 complicated offshore rigs. We work with every major shipyard out there. We've got great project management expertise, great relationships with every major shipyard around the globe. And these same shipyards were -- customers are very challenged when it comes to building FPSO vessels on time, on budget. Plus, when we looked at our portfolio of product offerings between hose reel systems, offloading systems, cranes, composite piping, production chokes and valves and manifolds and other things, we had a lot of content with FPSO. So we've cultivated an FPSO strategy and said, we have specifics. We're uniquely positioned in terms of our shipyard expertise to execute a strategy of improving FPSO construction, bringing more industrially elegant solutions to the supply chain against simplifying the things that you're hearing a lot more of lately to reduce cost and risk around FPSO construction. And NOV is uniquely positioned with regards to a vessel strategy in the deepwater. And then we've supplemented that with acquisitions along the way, including APL turret mooring systems, one of the 3 global providers of turret mooring systems in swivel stack technologies with NKT Flexibles, which is now NOV Flexibles, 1 of the 3 global providers of flexible pipe, a big component of served packages that sort of fit the strategy. So that's an example of where we're deploying capital to execute a strategy that, I think, is -- has positioned us to be transformative in a significant sector in oilfield services and thereby reduce cost for our customers. So that's an example the kind of things that we're looking at. And suffice to say in a cyclical downturn, we're continuing to look for other opportunities to deploy capital and develop businesses."

And unfortunately, it's driven by rig count and really, the inverse of rig count, which are stacked rigs. Because the stacked rigs is there -- as activity goes down, then it frees up a string of drill pipe. It frees up the downhole tools that otherwise would be working on that working rig. And so it's very fluid and very difficult to tell frankly, until we hit bottom on activity. And we see a little time pass beyond that, very difficult to tell kind of where that's going to lie. We're seeing customers be far more aggressive, I think, in this downturn with regards to cannibalizing their equipment, about repositioning it. They're getting -- they have a particular piece of equipment in a different region. There's a cost to repositioning. There's freight. There's -- they have to invest in that to just to move it and maybe to get it back to working order. And we're seeing customers go to more extraordinary length, I think, in this downturn we have in the preceding couple of downturns with regards to cannibalization. So there's a very, very Darwinian -- very Draconian move to preserve cash and use what's on hand, and so that we're -- we're seeing that. We do know it will turn around and when it does, one day the phones will light up and people will also need it yesterday. And so that's the other side of this. But we just -- at this point, we don't know when that's going to occur."

Second, as I mentioned, we have sort of an outsourcing model within good times and have done a great job for scaling back our outside suppliers about in-sourcing or in managing to the volume that's out there. Third, as backlog moves down, there's more flexibility that opens up with regards to steps that they can take. Absorption does become harder, I think, from here on out. And then fourth, I think the wildcard out there sort of remains pricing to some degree, kind of where that lands. So I think it's very difficult, I think, I'd be reluctant to throw a margin number or a range out there right now, other than we're -- as I said many times before, we're going to manage what we can and manage to the market. It maybe helpful, too, to point out that our global network within rig of plans and facilities really serve both Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket. The same plants that make components for rigs also make spare parts, and these components are used both offshore and on land. And between Rig Aftermarket continuing demand and ongoing work and ongoing demand for components to replace things that are worn out, replace things that are burned up to upgrade rigs even in the downturn, you're going to see rigs that need to upgrade certain components in order to qualify for certain work. I think we could keep a decent load on our plants in our core team through that. So that's where kind of shifting to as it will slow down a little bit. The other part that I'm probably more optimistic about in terms of demand in rig is we know a number of drilling contractors in North America and around the globe who are completely bought into the idea and the need to upgrade their fleets to AC technology. This is clearly where the market is going. And so I think in terms of recovery, that's where we would see it next."

31900,309461788,884431,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren.

National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other items of $112 million pretax or $0.20 per share after tax. 
Excluding these, earnings were $0.61 per fully diluted share, down 21% from the second quarter of 2015 and down 62% from the third quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring and other items from all periods.
Third quarter 2015 revenues were $3.3 billion, down 15% from the second quarter 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $346 million or 10.5% of sales, and EBITDA was $511 million or 15.5% of sales, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Decremental operating leverage was 18% from the second quarter to the third, as cost reductions across the organization helped minimize the margin impact from lower sequential volumes.
A second major decline in oil prices from the high-$50 range back into the low to mid-$40 range since June has increased financial stress and led to a second round of rig activity reduction, sending the U.S. rig count down by almost 60% since late 2014 peaks. 
We expect to see further activity reductions and pricing pressures continuing into the fourth quarter. Visibility is limited, but we believe most producers will further reduce for 2016 CapEx plans after cutting spending significantly in 2015. 
The industry has not seen 2 years of declining CapEx since the 1980s, signaling the severity of the downturn we find ourselves in. We believe many, if not most, North American producers in OPEC countries are producing existing fields close to maximum levels, trying to offset lower revenues due to oil price declines with higher volumes while sharply reducing drilling activity.
OPEC and non-OPEC production are up year-over-year. This is not sustainable. Production will begin to decline naturally as it has begun to in the United States, and therein lies the seeds for a recovery. 
However, with swollen inventories moderating demand growth with economic weakness in Asia and elsewhere around the globe and an uncertain trajectory for incremental oil exports from Iran, we don't expect to recover anytime soon. 
Nevertheless, it will come, and our plan is to manage what we can, namely costs, through the downturn while continuing to position and strengthen our franchise for the inevitable upturn.
We expect to accomplish this through a combination of organic investment in new technologies and capabilities as well as extraordinary acquisition opportunities that we expect to emerge. 
Through the first part of this downturn, we deployed $3 billion of capital into our share repurchase program, returning 1 out of 8 shares over the past year, while maintaining capital flexibility through our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. 
As the downturn has lengthened, we believe values of potential target companies will become more and more compelling. Thus far, it has been challenging to bring the bid and the ask on potential acquisitions into alignment, but we remain patient and disciplined in these discussions.
As we move into 2016, we believe sellers are likely to reduce their expectations and better capital returns on M&A will follow.
Consequently, our capital deployment strategy is shifting from share buybacks to an external focus on potential acquisitions. This is a sound capital deployment strategy that we will continue to execute in a disciplined way. 
NOV closed small 4 acquisitions during the third quarter of 2015. The strategic goal of these and other transactions will continue to focus on cultivating market leadership in selected subsectors within oilfield services and manufacturing. 
As we have said many times before, market leadership yields competitive advantage, economies of scale, purchasing leverage, the ability to leverage R&D and introduce new products through a larger revenue base, the more rapid accumulation of experience within the subsector, our global aftermarket support network, et cetera.
Our market positions make us a trusted, efficient, low-risk supplier to our customers. These are the types of opportunities that we look for, and the businesses we have built employing this strategy are leaders in their respective fields. In short, NOV represents a portfolio of market leaders with the deepest experience and the most expertise.
Within these businesses, we have assembled discrete packages of equipment and services to drive higher efficiency in ways that our customers really want and in ways that really improve their businesses.
This means we take a view on where the logical boundaries of these packaged offerings should lie. Our acquisitions are of enterprises where NOV can be a better owner to accelerate growth, drive efficiency and fully unlock their potential to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
This view on product groupings or packaged boundaries rest on questions like, what products have complex technical interfaces that are difficult for our customers to manage -- interfaces where a single vendor can and should undertake the interface management challenge. What proprietary technology can we build a logical package of products and services around? What trends do we see amongst customers as they all seek to reduce costs and risk around their operations? The development of our corporate strategies within our business units guides both our M&A strategy as well as our research and development strategy; both work in concert.
In the near term, we will continue to focus on managing costs to the marketplace, and our shallow decremental margins speak to the great job NOV's business unit managers have done in this effort. 
SG&A is down 34% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Rig Systems posted decremental leverage of 28% on a 23% sequential sales decline. Rig Aftermarket held operating profit flat despite unexpectedly high 13% revenue decline. 
Wellbore Technologies held decrementals to 21% despite a 13% sequential sales decline. And Completion & Production Solutions held decrementals to 24% in the face of a 9% sales decline. I'm extraordinarily grateful to these business leaders who are skillfully reducing our capacity, managing costs and leading our core team through this challenging time. They are providing their teams with a vision of better days ahead to make sure that our folks see the prosperity that will follow for NOV; that's critical in a downturn.
We are fundamentally a service business even in our manufacturing units, and ensuring our workforce continues with our long tradition of taking care of our customers and not getting distracted during stormy weather is critical. I want all of our employees to know that I am very proud of what you are doing.
Difficult market conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We supply highly capital-intensive industry and have benefited from decade-plus period of retooling, with improved levels of technology and automation. But the industrial transformation is far from over. Our view is that we are currently in a cyclical pause. Recent oversupply of oil, exacerbated by weak economic demand growth, has demonstrated the power of newer, more capable rigs in completion equipment and techniques. 
During such a cyclical pause, our biggest competitor becomes the overhang products and consumables and equipment that our customers cannibalize extremely effectively in their Darwinian quest to preserve cash. The idled rigs and pressure-pumping fleets and wireline units and a myriad of other items we sell are being systematically stripped of spare parts and components to keep the much smaller fleet of units that remain under contract, working. 
This remains a highly capital equipment-consumptive industry. The life expectancy of mechanical equipment is tied to the footage it drills or the volume of profit it pumps. The ability of the industry to increase borehole created per year or stages fracked per year means that the physical consumption of mechanical equipment per year has also risen sharply, probably linearly. NOV will be called upon again to resume capitalizing the critical fleets of equipment required to supply a growing population with rising energy needs as we pass through this cyclical downturn. And as I said, we will emerge better and stronger.
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment held operating margins of nearly 8% despite a 9% sequential sales decline. The group benefited from strong performance from our floating production unit and our flexible subsea pipe unit in the quarter. 
We also posted good orders in the quarter, helped by a large deepwater flexible pipe order arising from our proprietary heated pipe solution. This resulted in an ending backlog level of $1.2 billion. 
We expect orders to decline in the fourth quarter as the market faces an overhang of fracture stimulation equipment across North America, and as operators seem in no hurry to sanction any deepwater developments at the moment. Nevertheless, we are engaged in several FEED studies around the globe and meeting with lot of operator interest in standardized more industrial-efficient solutions to improve deepwater development economics. 
We're encouraged by a handful of public statements from major oil companies on meaningful, double-digit cost reductions on deepwater projects, driven by the combination of design simplification, supplier participation in design and supply chain deflation -- fit-for-purpose solutions rather than ""perfect"" solutions. 
We continue to develop new products within the group in areas like composites, spoolable, piping systems for corrosive-produced fluids. In fact, we shipped our first string of spoolable composite pipe into Saudi Arabia this quarter. And we expect to install our first string of our proprietary smart pipe for shallow well dewatering in Australia in the fourth quarter. 
Nevertheless, with 30%-plus declines in prices for steel pipe, have made steel pipe more competitive for our composite pipe unit. However, as fields mature and water cuts rise, we expect our customers to gravitate to our corrosion-proof solutions.
We were also pleased to see higher sales in coiled tubing in the quarter on gains with key accounts and our new service center in the Northeast pulling sales through.
Our Wellbore Technologies group is driven by rig activity, and we're now facing a second rising wave of price pressure across all our products and services as rig activity declines. The group saw demand for almost all of its products and services decline except for our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe technology, which has seen growing interest from operators in conjunction with our automated drilling solutions. 
This technology enables microsecond data from downhole sensors to control rig machinery much more effectively than human drillers and increases rates of penetration significantly. We have several programs scheduled to spud with this later this year and into 2016 and are excited about the transformative capabilities of high-speed data from the bottom of the well.
New bid technologies we've introduced are helping drive market share gains, and we are pressing forward with new products in managed pressure drilling and wide catch fishing tool technologies. The operation of our test rig is helping accelerate time-to-market for many new products and new conditioning -- conditioned monitoring technologies.
We've seen our customers aggressively reposition and utilize their own fleets of equipment wherever possible to preserve cash, and our mix of drilling tools shift from sales to rentals as a result. The demand for drill pipe has been very weak as drillers cannibalize strings from idled rigs to support working rigs, but we have reduced capacity to match the current market.
Our Tuboscope unit has held up reasonably well as its work has shifted from drill pipe to line pipe and tubing.
Rig Aftermarket segment declined 13% sequentially as more and more rigs went idle and became fresh sources of spare parts for their owners, driving sales in spare parts and manifolds lower. Nevertheless, the group held operating profit flat and operating margins increased 350 basis points.
We saw our account of SPS projects on offshore rigs flatten this quarter after increases through the first half, as many plans for reactivation and recertification programs are being shelved by drillers due to growing concerns about the near-term outlook for offshore rig demand. Nevertheless, SPS activity is up year-over-year, and we are also seeing rising inquiries around maintenance services we can provide on stack rigs.
Rig Systems demand remains weak overall, and we are downsizing to address this reality. We still see certain markets moving into the 21st century to employ proven technologies: Argentina, the CIS, the Middle East -- and we're aggressively pursuing these opportunities.
We also know many North American drillers continue to -- or plan to continue to high grade their fleets to AC Tier 1 capabilities once prosperity returns. Origin Rig Systems included land rigs for international markets and 2 jack-up packages. And we're up modestly from the second quarter, resulting in an ending backlog of $8 billion for the group. 
We expect orders to remain low through 2016 when scheduled outflows from backlog will be in the $2.4 billion range. Those are orders that are scheduled right now in the backlog. In certain instances, we continue to work with customers to systematically delay deliveries of rigs, which is improving our project margins as we were able to reduce overtime and source components more efficiently.
Brazilian rigs totaled $3 billion of the $8 billion in our September 30 backlog and accounted for only $53 million of revenues during the third quarter. As we reported previously, we have suspended or delayed work on certain of these 22 rigs. Our shipyard customers are continuing to work with their customers at Sete to address overdue funding needs and future funding to move the projects forward. In the meantime, we are reducing costs in-country.
Within Rig Systems, third quarter revenue is associated with new offshore rigs. Both floaters and jack-ups totaled $860 million or 26% of consolidated revenues during the third quarter. While we expect some new specialized offshore rigs to be built by the industry over the next couple of years, we are developing -- and we are developing new designs and capabilities around these, we do not expect the level of building that we have seen over the past decade to resume for quite a while. Like many, we are awaiting an increase in scrapping of older units across the fleet, which seems inevitable at this point.
Finally, I'm delighted to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Jose Bayardo, to our team. Many of you know Jose from his time at Complete Production Services, and more recently at Continental Resources.
Let me turn it over to Jose to discuss our third quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Jose?"

It's great to be here with everyone this morning. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the",2144,"Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the segment in the third quarter of 2014. Revenue out of backlog was $1.3 billion, down 24% sequentially, in line with total revenue for the segment. Revenues declined as we continued to adjust our project schedules and manage output to navigate effectively through fewer orders of lower backlog and customer-requested delivery delays on certain projects.
For Q3, the split between offshore- and land-related revenue was 78% and 22%, respectively. Operating profit as adjusted for the reconciliations in our earnings release for the Rig Systems segment was $275 million, yielding operating margins of 18.4%, down 210 basis points from Q2. 
Decremental operating profit margins were 27.6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Low decremental margins demonstrate the effectiveness of our efforts to improve process efficiencies and resize the business to anticipated production levels. EBITDA was $300 million or 20.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 160 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015.
During the third quarter, we received $367 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 28%. Orders for the quarter were fairly evenly weighted across offshore and land and included 2 high-spec jack-up drilling equipment packages and 2,000 to 3,000-horsepower land rigs for the Middle East.
FX adjustments of $77 million resulted in quarter ending backlog of $8 billion, down 11% sequentially, of which approximately 90% is offshore and 93% is destined for international markets.
We expect orders to remain subdued as activity continues to decline on land and offshore, and uncertainty regarding the timing of a recovery persists. We are seeing some demand for a few jack-ups from NOCs and while opportunities for floaters are generally scarce, meaningful conversations on 20,000k psi floaters and other application-specific rigs continue.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect total Rig Systems revenue to decline approximately 10% into the $1.3 billion range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to about $1.1 billion as we see reductions in new order activity both through existing projects and to work with customers to accommodate certain requests to extend delivery dates.
Resizing the business to reflect market activity remains critical to margin preservation, and we will continue to focus on cost-reduction opportunities, including process, efficiencies, vendor pricing and facility consolidations to better align our resources with anticipated production levels. That said, cost control will not be enough to fully offset the impact of lower volumes, and we anticipate segment margins will decline into the mid-teens during the fourth quarter.
Despite the current challenges and customer capital constraints, longer-term fundamentals remain solid for our Rig Systems segment. Land rig customers continue to show a strong preference for rigs which utilize the latest technologies to most efficiently and precisely drill longer lateral wells from multi-well pads. 
And offshore exploration and production companies are committed to utilizing new rigs and equipment that enhance their ability to more safely and economically access hydrocarbons in increasingly challenging environments. NOV will continue to make long-term investments in the development of the best technological solutions that provide industry-leading quality and reliability to most effectively address the needs of our customers.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated revenues of $570 million during the third quarter of 2015, down 13% sequentially and down 32% year-over-year, driven by lower spare part sales as drilling contractors continue to focus on reducing their expenditures amid activity declines. 
The reduction in spare part sales was partially offset by a slight increase in service-related work. Despite the low-teens revenue decline, the segment maintained flat operating profit at $146 million, resulting in operating margins of 25.6%, a 350-basis-point improvement sequentially, due to effective cost controls and inventory charges incurred in the second quarter, which did not repeat.
EBITDA was $154 million or 27% of sales. Consistent with second quarter, land-related sales were approximately 22% of total segment revenues. Near term, we expect the segment will continue to ebb and flow as our customers try to identify the bottom of this current cycle. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the pickup in service and repair revenue we have seen the last quarter of prior years will be much more modest this year as uncertainty leads to more cautionary spending by our customers. However, we do anticipate Rig Aftermarket revenues will be up slightly in comparison to Q3.
Operating margins are expected to be similar to the third quarter as increases resulting from incremental revenues will be offset by product mix. In our rig businesses, we distinguish ourselves through service after the sale. We are committed to the success of our customers and driven by a sense of urgency in maintaining and supporting our equipment and technology in the field.
The capabilities of our global service network are unrivaled. The mid- to long-term outlook for the Rig Aftermarket segment remains bright, and we anticipate sales will begin to improve as soon as customers work through their limited existing inventories of spare parts. We also anticipate the improvement will accelerate once overall industry activity levels begin to increase, causing a rush to return sub-optimally maintained stacked and partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating conditions.
For the third quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $834 million, down 13% sequentially and down 43% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Almost all business units within the segment were impacted by the overall decrease in drilling activity levels with production-oriented businesses realizing slightly better performance.
Customer interest continues to grow in our technologically advanced products and services, which reduce drill times and lower operating costs such as our tectonic drill bits, connection drilling performance software and our SoftSpeed stick-slip prevention services. One of our tectonic bits was recently paired with our HellCat motor and Agitator drill system to drill a 2.5-mile long lateral in the Bakken in what we and our customer believe to be a record time of 4.5 days.
Operating profit for the third quarter was $22 million or 2.6% of sales, down 230 basis points from last quarter. Sequential decrementals were limited to 20.5% as we continue to focus on expense reduction and process efficiencies to develop a leaner cost structure for the business. Q3 EBITDA was $119 million or 14.3% of revenue.
Looking into the fourth quarter of 2015, many of our North American customers are bracing for a further fall-off in activity during what they anticipate will be a prolonged year-end holiday slowdown. Fewer rigs running will result in weaker demand for Wellbore Technologies' products and services, and we are seeing a new wave of pricing pressure, which may offset our cost-reduction efforts. 
As such, we believe revenues in our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline in the mid- to high single-percentage range with decremental margins in the mid-20s. Longer term, we anticipate continued market share gains from our advanced products and services designed to enable the drilling of more complex, productive and safer wells at a faster rate, thereby enhancing the economics. 
We believe our strategy to help our customers achieve their objectives is succeeding and we will continue to invest in solutions our customers value today and which will further enhance our position for eventual recovery.
Our Completions & Productions Solutions segment generated revenues of $798 million for the third quarter 2015, down 9% sequentially and 33% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Revenues declined across most businesses on lower backlogs and customers delaying pickup of finished work with some offset coming from higher sales, floating production-related equipment and flexible pipe. 
We also saw increased coiled tubing sales as our investments in placing tubing centers closer to our customers' operations enable us to provide better service. Operating profit for the segment was $63 million, resulting in operating margins of 7.9%, down 140 basis points sequentially and 750 basis points year-over-year. 
Sequential decrementals were 24% and third quarter EBITDA for the segment was $117 million or 14.7% of sales. Operating margins were negatively impacted by volume, pricing pressure and product mix, but most cost-control initiatives helped to offset some of the margin decline, resulting in improved decrementals versus prior quarters.
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for the Completion & Production Solutions. The third quarter saw a much improved order intake of $467 million. That's an increase of $212 million or 83% sequentially, led by improved bookings for floating production relating -- related equipment and fiberglass pipe as well as a large order for subsea flexible pipe. 
We recognized $472 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 99%. Of the $1.2 billion backlog at quarter end, approximately 76% is offshore and 86% is international.
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate demand for our new pressure pumping and coiled tubing unit, especially in North America, will remain low. And while customer interest remains elevated for NOV's more cost-effective solutions in the FPSO space, near term, we anticipate a general slowing in prospect development due to the current commodity price environment. 
We believe revenues will decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage and expect revenue out of backlog to remain in the $450 million to $470 million range. Margins should move down slightly on lower volumes.
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the third quarter, gross margin declined 110 basis points to 21.2%. SG&A decreased 15% or $63 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. 
Other items of $112 million for the quarter resulted primarily from a $55 million pretax intangible asset impairment as well as a $57 million pretax charges associated with severance facility closures and other costs.
Equity income fell to breakeven as demand for OCTGs or green tube associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drill pipe. Other expense for the quarter decreased $10 million sequentially to $20 million, due primarily to a reduction in foreign exchange-related losses relative to the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.8%, down from the 26.9% rate posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Excluding the impact of $112 million in other items, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%, reflective of the continuing high mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions. EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding other items, was $511 million or 15.5% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.9 billion at September 30, 2015, down $206 million or 3% sequentially. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of $222 million reduction in inventory levels, $151 million reduction in accounts receivable, an $88 million increase in accrued taxes and a $10 million decrease in customer financings, which is the net of prepayments and billings in excess of costs against costs in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While we were pleased to see total working capital decrease and we anticipate the pace of cash flow generation from working capital will increase as we move forward, we continue to manage several items impacting our efforts to reduce the capital employed in our business including in-sourcing of machining hours, which increases our inventory by bringing in raw materials, which otherwise would have been held by third-party vendors, customers looking to delay equipment deliveries and extend payment terms and our Rig Systems backlog and its associated customer financings.
Regarding financings. As projects approach their completion, we do anticipate the spread between prepayments and costs in excess of billings to narrow, further contributing to a future reduction of working capital. 
For the quarter, the company generated $410 million in cash flow from operations. Offsetting this cash flow were share repurchases of $444 million, dividend payments of $174 million, investments in our business of $124 million and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $44 million. 
The net impact of our cash flow for the quarter was a $376 million increase in net debt. However, total debt decreased $322 million as we successfully repatriated $1.1 billion to the U.S. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net-to-debt capitalization was 11.8%. 
While we remain focused on managing costs and improving efficiencies, we believe the strength of our enterprise uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on compelling acquisition opportunities that will emerge in this downturn and to continue investing in the development of technologies that will help our customers improve their economics.
With that, we'd like to turn it open to questions."

And then beyond that, the great thing about oilfield services is it's composed of dozens and dozens and dozens of interesting subsectors, and so we're continually looking across those for opportunities to deploy capital and develop our business. We also have some great industrial product lines and businesses in markets that we serve. Usually, those are characterized by some sort of overlapping confidence that we have in the oilfield. We make a product, for instance, if the oilfield needs it, it also goes into other industrial segments. So usually, there's some sort of overlap or synergy that's embedded in those sort of opportunities. But yes, we're taking a very expansive view. The reason for the comments, obviously, is a lot of parts of -- well, really all parts of oilfield services and manufacturing under stress in the current environment and landscape shifting, and so at the low points in the cycle's where we frequently see the best opportunities. And as you know, we have a long history of executing acquisitions. And both National Oilwell and Varco came out of private equity roots. And through the years, between our 2 organizations -- we came together about 10 years ago, we've done probably in excess of 300 transactions. So this is becoming a buyer's market, and we're pretty excited about that."

As Jose mentioned, it takes a little more inventory to accomplish. On the fuel cost front, it varies by product line. We've seen dramatic deflation in pipe prices, for instance. On castings and forgings, yes, I think we're seeing the same thing others are, which is a little less deflation. But really across the entire supplier network, we're pressing for lower pricing and continually trying to become more efficient."

We're doing more detailed planning around what 2016 is going to look like, and we always reach out to our customers to kind of get their guidance. And what we're finding is they don't know what they're going to spend. So generally, though, I think the first part of 2016 is going to continue to be really challenging. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our expectation is activity is going to trend lower. I think like everybody in this industry that we remain hopeful we'll get a little bit of commodity price help and relief and then maybe the second half of the year, we start to see maybe activity pick up a little bit. But I don't have a lot of data to point to as to why that would happen. Jose and I were chatting earlier. And Jose, you mentioned the fact that producers come under a lot of pressure when they start facing production declines. And so I think there'll be an impetus at least across North America to get back to drilling as soon as they can. Of course, that will take a while. A lot of the equipment that's out there has been depleted of spare parts and cannibalized, and so a little bit of uptick in activity is going to take a lot of work from NOV. So we're looking forward to that time."

That's -- that business is certainly under a lot of pressure and the management team there has done a great job scaling back to match the market and holding as best they can. But yes, that's our business that makes drill pipe for the rest of you. And what we see is particularly onshore operators moving drill pipe off of idled rigs and moving that onto the rigs that remain working. It's a little more challenging offshore. It's expensive to demobilize a string of pipe off of an offshore rig, so a little less impacted from cannibalization there, but certainly, onshore, that's impacted them. The good news is that their mix has improved. We're the market leader in terms of providing premium connections of high tensile strength pipe, set new records in places like Sukkwan Island in terms of extended rigs drilling out 7, 8 miles. And really, broadly speaking, you step back and view this -- the demand for drill pipe -- a lot of technology in drill pipe, and drill pipe is consumed at a much faster rate when it's used to drill these horizontal wells, these long patterns that are really making the shale plays go. So yes, we're in this period when demand is down. Teams have done a great job. They are managing through it. But once we recover, I think a shale phenomenon is going to continue to consume more and more drill pipe that we make."

But -- and I tried to touch on this in my opening remarks, the principles that we apply. Since I've been with the company, we've grown from 2 business units to 15, and I'll reiterate we take a broad view across oilfield services and look for opportunities to deploy capital and develop strategies around things. I'll go back a couple of years and give you a real world example. We launched an FPSO initiative about 4, 5 years ago. And I'll just point out, this is long before anybody was talking about standardization, about industrial efficient supply chain, we were sort of a lone voice on this subject. But we recognized NOV has built, installed and commissioned 300 complicated offshore rigs. We work with every major shipyard out there. We've got great project management expertise, great relationships with every major shipyard around the globe. And these same shipyards were -- customers are very challenged when it comes to building FPSO vessels on time, on budget. Plus, when we looked at our portfolio of product offerings between hose reel systems, offloading systems, cranes, composite piping, production chokes and valves and manifolds and other things, we had a lot of content with FPSO. So we've cultivated an FPSO strategy and said, we have specifics. We're uniquely positioned in terms of our shipyard expertise to execute a strategy of improving FPSO construction, bringing more industrially elegant solutions to the supply chain -- again simplifying, the things that you're hearing a lot more of lately to reduce cost and risk around FPSO construction. And NOV is uniquely positioned with regards to a vessel strategy in the deepwater. And then we've supplemented that with acquisitions along the way, including APL turret mooring systems, one of the best global providers of turret mooring systems in swivel stack technologies with NKT Flexibles, which is now NOV Flexibles, 1 of 3 global providers of flexible pipe, a big component of served packages that sort of fit the strategy. So that's an example of where we're deploying capital to execute a strategy that, I think, is -- has positioned us to be transformative in a significant sector in oilfield services and thereby reduce cost for our customers. So that's an example of the kind of things that we're looking at. And suffice to say in a cyclical downturn, we're continuing to look for other opportunities to deploy capital and develop businesses."

And unfortunately, it's driven by rig count and really, the inverse of rig count, which are stacked rigs. Because the stacked rigs is there -- as activity goes down, then it frees up a string of drill pipe. It frees up the downhole tools that otherwise would be working on that working rig. And so it's very fluid and very difficult to tell frankly, until we hit bottom on activity, and we see a little time pass beyond that, very difficult to tell kind of where that's going to lie. We're seeing customers be far more aggressive, I think, in this downturn with regards to cannibalizing their equipment, about repositioning it. They're getting -- if they have a particular piece of equipment in a different region, there's a cost to repositioning that. There's freight. There's -- they have to invest in that to just to move it and maybe to get it back to working order. And we're seeing customers go to more extraordinary length, I think, in this downturn than we have in the preceding couple of downturns with regards to cannibalization. So there's a very, very Darwinian -- very Draconian move to preserve cash and use what's on hand, and so that we're -- we're seeing that. We do know it will turn around and when it does, one day the phones will light up and people will also need it yesterday. And so that's the other side of this. But we just -- at this point, we don't know when that's going to occur."

First, I have a lot of confidence in our management team there to manage through this. They have done a great job along the way. Second, as I mentioned, we have sort of an outsourcing model within good times and they're doing a great job for scaling back our outside suppliers about in-sourcing or in managing to the volume that's out there. Third, as backlog moves down, there's more flexibility that opens up with regards to steps that they can take. Absorption does become harder, I think, from here on out. And then fourth, I think the wildcard out there sort of remains pricing to some degree, kind of where that lands. So I think it's very difficult, I think, I'd be reluctant to throw a margin number or a range out there right now, other than we're -- as I said many times before, we're going to manage what we can and manage to the market. It may be helpful, too, to point out that our global network within rig of plants and facilities really serve both Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket. The same plants that make components for rigs also make spare parts, and these components are used both offshore and on land. And between Rig Aftermarket continuing demand and ongoing work and ongoing demand for components to replace things that are worn out, replace things that are burned up, to upgrade rigs even in the downturn, you're going to see rigs that need to upgrade certain components in order to qualify for certain work. I think we could keep a decent load on our plants in our core team through that. So that's where we're kind of shifting to as it will slow down a little bit. The other part that I'm probably more optimistic about in terms of demand in rig is we know a number of drilling contractors in North America and around the globe who are completely bought into the idea and the need to upgrade their fleets to AC technology. This is clearly where the market is going. And so I think in terms of recovery, that's where we would see it next."

National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and othe",2385,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other items of $112 million pretax or $0.20 per share after tax. 
Excluding these, earnings were $0.61 per fully diluted share, down 21% from the second quarter of 2015 and down 62% from the third quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring and other items from all periods.
Third quarter 2015 revenues were $3.3 billion, down 15% from the second quarter 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $346 million or 10.5% of sales, and EBITDA was $511 million or 15.5% of sales, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Decremental operating leverage was 18% from the second quarter to the third, as cost reductions across the organization helped minimize the margin impact from lower sequential volumes.
A second major decline in oil prices from the high-$50 range back into the low to mid-$40 range since June has increased financial stress and led to a second round of rig activity reduction, sending the U.S. rig count down by almost 60% since late 2014 peaks. 
We expect to see further activity reductions and pricing pressures continuing into the fourth quarter. Visibility is limited, but we believe most producers will further reduce for 2016 CapEx plans after cutting spending significantly in 2015. 
The industry has not seen 2 years of declining CapEx since the 1980s, signaling the severity of the downturn we find ourselves in. We believe many, if not most, North American producers in OPEC countries are producing existing fields close to maximum levels, trying to offset lower revenues due to oil price declines with higher volumes while sharply reducing drilling activity.
OPEC and non-OPEC production are up year-over-year. This is not sustainable. Production will begin to decline naturally as it has begun to in the United States, and therein lies the seeds for a recovery. 
However, with swollen inventories moderating demand growth with economic weakness in Asia and elsewhere around the globe and an uncertain trajectory for incremental oil exports from Iran, we don't expect to recover anytime soon. 
Nevertheless, it will come, and our plan is to manage what we can, namely costs, through the downturn while continuing to position and strengthen our franchise for the inevitable upturn.
We expect to accomplish this through a combination of organic investment in new technologies and capabilities as well as extraordinary acquisition opportunities that we expect to emerge. 
Through the first part of this downturn, we deployed $3 billion of capital into our share repurchase program, returning 1 out of 8 shares over the past year, while maintaining capital flexibility through our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. 
As the downturn has lengthened, we believe values of potential target companies will become more and more compelling. Thus far, it has been challenging to bring the bid and the ask on potential acquisitions into alignment, but we remain patient and disciplined in these discussions.
As we move into 2016, we believe sellers are likely to reduce their expectations and better capital returns on M&A will follow.
Consequently, our capital deployment strategy is shifting from share buybacks to an external focus on potential acquisitions. This is a sound capital deployment strategy that we will continue to execute in a disciplined way. 
NOV closed small 4 acquisitions during the third quarter of 2015. The strategic goal of these and other transactions will continue to focus on cultivating market leadership in selected subsectors within oilfield services and manufacturing. 
As we have said many times before, market leadership yields competitive advantage, economies of scale, purchasing leverage, the ability to leverage R&D and introduce new products through a larger revenue base, the more rapid accumulation of experience within the subsector, our global aftermarket support network, et cetera.
Our market positions make us a trusted, efficient, low-risk supplier to our customers. These are the types of opportunities that we look for, and the businesses we have built employing this strategy are leaders in their respective fields. In short, NOV represents a portfolio of market leaders with the deepest experience and the most expertise.
Within these businesses, we have assembled discrete packages of equipment and services to drive higher efficiency in ways that our customers really want and in ways that really improve their businesses.
This means we take a view on where the logical boundaries of these packaged offerings should lie. Our acquisitions are of enterprises where NOV can be a better owner to accelerate growth, drive efficiency and fully unlock their potential to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
This view on product groupings or packaged boundaries rest on questions like, what products have complex technical interfaces that are difficult for our customers to manage -- interfaces where a single vendor can and should undertake the interface management challenge. What proprietary technology can we build a logical package of products and services around? What trends do we see amongst customers as they all seek to reduce costs and risk around their operations? The development of our corporate strategies within our business units guides both our M&A strategy as well as our research and development strategy; both work in concert.
In the near term, we will continue to focus on managing costs to the marketplace, and our shallow decremental margins speak to the great job NOV's business unit managers have done in this effort. 
SG&A is down 34% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Rig Systems posted decremental leverage of 28% on a 23% sequential sales decline. Rig Aftermarket held operating profit flat despite unexpectedly high 13% revenue decline. 
Wellbore Technologies held decrementals to 21% despite a 13% sequential sales decline. And Completion & Production Solutions held decrementals to 24% in the face of a 9% sales decline. I'm extraordinarily grateful to these business leaders who are skillfully reducing our capacity, managing costs and leading our core team through this challenging time. They are providing their teams with a vision of better days ahead to make sure that our folks see the prosperity that will follow for NOV; that's critical in a downturn.
We are fundamentally a service business even in our manufacturing units, and ensuring our workforce continues with our long tradition of taking care of our customers and not getting distracted during stormy weather is critical. I want all of our employees to know that I am very proud of what you are doing.
Difficult market conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We supply highly capital-intensive industry and have benefited from decade-plus period of retooling, with improved levels of technology and automation. But the industrial transformation is far from over. Our view is that we are currently in a cyclical pause. Recent oversupply of oil, exacerbated by weak economic demand growth, has demonstrated the power of newer, more capable rigs in completion equipment and techniques. 
During such a cyclical pause, our biggest competitor becomes the overhang products and consumables and equipment that our customers cannibalize extremely effectively in their Darwinian quest to preserve cash. The idled rigs and pressure-pumping fleets and wireline units and a myriad of other items we sell are being systematically stripped of spare parts and components to keep the much smaller fleet of units that remain under contract, working. 
This remains a highly capital equipment-consumptive industry. The life expectancy of mechanical equipment is tied to the footage it drills or the volume of profit it pumps. The ability of the industry to increase borehole created per year or stages fracked per year means that the physical consumption of mechanical equipment per year has also risen sharply, probably linearly. NOV will be called upon again to resume capitalizing the critical fleets of equipment required to supply a growing population with rising energy needs as we pass through this cyclical downturn. And as I said, we will emerge better and stronger.
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment held operating margins of nearly 8% despite a 9% sequential sales decline. The group benefited from strong performance from our floating production unit and our flexible subsea pipe unit in the quarter. 
We also posted good orders in the quarter, helped by a large deepwater flexible pipe order arising from our proprietary heated pipe solution. This resulted in an ending backlog level of $1.2 billion. 
We expect orders to decline in the fourth quarter as the market faces an overhang of fracture stimulation equipment across North America, and as operators seem in no hurry to sanction any deepwater developments at the moment. Nevertheless, we are engaged in several FEED studies around the globe and meeting with lot of operator interest in standardized more industrial-efficient solutions to improve deepwater development economics. 
We're encouraged by a handful of public statements from major oil companies on meaningful, double-digit cost reductions on deepwater projects, driven by the combination of design simplification, supplier participation in design and supply chain deflation -- fit-for-purpose solutions rather than ""perfect"" solutions. 
We continue to develop new products within the group in areas like composites, spoolable, piping systems for corrosive-produced fluids. In fact, we shipped our first string of spoolable composite pipe into Saudi Arabia this quarter. And we expect to install our first string of our proprietary smart pipe for shallow well dewatering in Australia in the fourth quarter. 
Nevertheless, with 30%-plus declines in prices for steel pipe, have made steel pipe more competitive for our composite pipe unit. However, as fields mature and water cuts rise, we expect our customers to gravitate to our corrosion-proof solutions.
We were also pleased to see higher sales in coiled tubing in the quarter on gains with key accounts and our new service center in the Northeast pulling sales through.
Our Wellbore Technologies group is driven by rig activity, and we're now facing a second rising wave of price pressure across all our products and services as rig activity declines. The group saw demand for almost all of its products and services decline except for our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe technology, which has seen growing interest from operators in conjunction with our automated drilling solutions. 
This technology enables microsecond data from downhole sensors to control rig machinery much more effectively than human drillers and increases rates of penetration significantly. We have several programs scheduled to spud with this later this year and into 2016 and are excited about the transformative capabilities of high-speed data from the bottom of the well.
New bid technologies we've introduced are helping drive market share gains, and we are pressing forward with new products in managed pressure drilling and wide catch fishing tool technologies. The operation of our test rig is helping accelerate time-to-market for many new products and new conditioning -- conditioned monitoring technologies.
We've seen our customers aggressively reposition and utilize their own fleets of equipment wherever possible to preserve cash, and our mix of drilling tools shift from sales to rentals as a result. The demand for drill pipe has been very weak as drillers cannibalize strings from idled rigs to support working rigs, but we have reduced capacity to match the current market.
Our Tuboscope unit has held up reasonably well as its work has shifted from drill pipe to line pipe and tubing.
Rig Aftermarket segment declined 13% sequentially as more and more rigs went idle and became fresh sources of spare parts for their owners, driving sales in spare parts and manifolds lower. Nevertheless, the group held operating profit flat and operating margins increased 350 basis points.
We saw our account of SPS projects on offshore rigs flatten this quarter after increases through the first half, as many plans for reactivation and recertification programs are being shelved by drillers due to growing concerns about the near-term outlook for offshore rig demand. Nevertheless, SPS activity is up year-over-year, and we are also seeing rising inquiries around maintenance services we can provide on stack rigs.
Rig Systems demand remains weak overall, and we are downsizing to address this reality. We still see certain markets moving into the 21st century to employ proven technologies: Argentina, the CIS, the Middle East -- and we're aggressively pursuing these opportunities.
We also know many North American drillers continue to -- or plan to continue to high grade their fleets to AC Tier 1 capabilities once prosperity returns. Origin Rig Systems included land rigs for international markets and 2 jack-up packages. And we're up modestly from the second quarter, resulting in an ending backlog of $8 billion for the group. 
We expect orders to remain low through 2016 when scheduled outflows from backlog will be in the $2.4 billion range. Those are orders that are scheduled right now in the backlog. In certain instances, we continue to work with customers to systematically delay deliveries of rigs, which is improving our project margins as we were able to reduce overtime and source components more efficiently.
Brazilian rigs totaled $3 billion of the $8 billion in our September 30 backlog and accounted for only $53 million of revenues during the third quarter. As we reported previously, we have suspended or delayed work on certain of these 22 rigs. Our shipyard customers are continuing to work with their customers at Sete to address overdue funding needs and future funding to move the projects forward. In the meantime, we are reducing costs in-country.
Within Rig Systems, third quarter revenue is associated with new offshore rigs. Both floaters and jack-ups totaled $860 million or 26% of consolidated revenues during the third quarter. While we expect some new specialized offshore rigs to be built by the industry over the next couple of years, we are developing -- and we are developing new designs and capabilities around these, we do not expect the level of building that we have seen over the past decade to resume for quite a while. Like many, we are awaiting an increase in scrapping of older units across the fleet, which seems inevitable at this point.
Finally, I'm delighted to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Jose Bayardo, to our team. Many of you know Jose from his time at Complete Production Services, and more recently at Continental Resources.
Let me turn it over to Jose to discuss our third quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Jose?"
31900,309461788,884903,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the",2144,"Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the segment in the third quarter of 2014. Revenue out of backlog was $1.3 billion, down 24% sequentially, in line with total revenue for the segment. Revenues declined as we continued to adjust our project schedules and manage output to navigate effectively through fewer orders of lower backlog and customer-requested delivery delays on certain projects.
For Q3, the split between offshore- and land-related revenue was 78% and 22%, respectively. Operating profit as adjusted for the reconciliations in our earnings release for the Rig Systems segment was $275 million, yielding operating margins of 18.4%, down 210 basis points from Q2. 
Decremental operating profit margins were 27.6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Low decremental margins demonstrate the effectiveness of our efforts to improve process efficiencies and resize the business to anticipated production levels. EBITDA was $300 million or 20.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 160 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015.
During the third quarter, we received $367 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 28%. Orders for the quarter were fairly evenly weighted across offshore and land and included 2 high-spec jack-up drilling equipment packages and 2,000 to 3,000-horsepower land rigs for the Middle East.
FX adjustments of $77 million resulted in quarter ending backlog of $8 billion, down 11% sequentially, of which approximately 90% is offshore and 93% is destined for international markets.
We expect orders to remain subdued as activity continues to decline on land and offshore, and uncertainty regarding the timing of a recovery persists. We are seeing some demand for a few jack-ups from NOCs and while opportunities for floaters are generally scarce, meaningful conversations on 20,000k psi floaters and other application-specific rigs continue.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect total Rig Systems revenue to decline approximately 10% into the $1.3 billion range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to about $1.1 billion as we see reductions in new order activity both through existing projects and to work with customers to accommodate certain requests to extend delivery dates.
Resizing the business to reflect market activity remains critical to margin preservation, and we will continue to focus on cost-reduction opportunities, including process, efficiencies, vendor pricing and facility consolidations to better align our resources with anticipated production levels. That said, cost control will not be enough to fully offset the impact of lower volumes, and we anticipate segment margins will decline into the mid-teens during the fourth quarter.
Despite the current challenges and customer capital constraints, longer-term fundamentals remain solid for our Rig Systems segment. Land rig customers continue to show a strong preference for rigs which utilize the latest technologies to most efficiently and precisely drill longer lateral wells from multi-well pads. 
And offshore exploration and production companies are committed to utilizing new rigs and equipment that enhance their ability to more safely and economically access hydrocarbons in increasingly challenging environments. NOV will continue to make long-term investments in the development of the best technological solutions that provide industry-leading quality and reliability to most effectively address the needs of our customers.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated revenues of $570 million during the third quarter of 2015, down 13% sequentially and down 32% year-over-year, driven by lower spare part sales as drilling contractors continue to focus on reducing their expenditures amid activity declines. 
The reduction in spare part sales was partially offset by a slight increase in service-related work. Despite the low-teens revenue decline, the segment maintained flat operating profit at $146 million, resulting in operating margins of 25.6%, a 350-basis-point improvement sequentially, due to effective cost controls and inventory charges incurred in the second quarter, which did not repeat.
EBITDA was $154 million or 27% of sales. Consistent with second quarter, land-related sales were approximately 22% of total segment revenues. Near term, we expect the segment will continue to ebb and flow as our customers try to identify the bottom of this current cycle. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the pickup in service and repair revenue we have seen the last quarter of prior years will be much more modest this year as uncertainty leads to more cautionary spending by our customers. However, we do anticipate Rig Aftermarket revenues will be up slightly in comparison to Q3.
Operating margins are expected to be similar to the third quarter as increases resulting from incremental revenues will be offset by product mix. In our rig businesses, we distinguish ourselves through service after the sale. We are committed to the success of our customers and driven by a sense of urgency in maintaining and supporting our equipment and technology in the field.
The capabilities of our global service network are unrivaled. The mid- to long-term outlook for the Rig Aftermarket segment remains bright, and we anticipate sales will begin to improve as soon as customers work through their limited existing inventories of spare parts. We also anticipate the improvement will accelerate once overall industry activity levels begin to increase, causing a rush to return sub-optimally maintained stacked and partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating conditions.
For the third quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $834 million, down 13% sequentially and down 43% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Almost all business units within the segment were impacted by the overall decrease in drilling activity levels with production-oriented businesses realizing slightly better performance.
Customer interest continues to grow in our technologically advanced products and services, which reduce drill times and lower operating costs such as our tectonic drill bits, connection drilling performance software and our SoftSpeed stick-slip prevention services. One of our tectonic bits was recently paired with our HellCat motor and Agitator drill system to drill a 2.5-mile long lateral in the Bakken in what we and our customer believe to be a record time of 4.5 days.
Operating profit for the third quarter was $22 million or 2.6% of sales, down 230 basis points from last quarter. Sequential decrementals were limited to 20.5% as we continue to focus on expense reduction and process efficiencies to develop a leaner cost structure for the business. Q3 EBITDA was $119 million or 14.3% of revenue.
Looking into the fourth quarter of 2015, many of our North American customers are bracing for a further fall-off in activity during what they anticipate will be a prolonged year-end holiday slowdown. Fewer rigs running will result in weaker demand for Wellbore Technologies' products and services, and we are seeing a new wave of pricing pressure, which may offset our cost-reduction efforts. 
As such, we believe revenues in our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline in the mid- to high single-percentage range with decremental margins in the mid-20s. Longer term, we anticipate continued market share gains from our advanced products and services designed to enable the drilling of more complex, productive and safer wells at a faster rate, thereby enhancing the economics. 
We believe our strategy to help our customers achieve their objectives is succeeding and we will continue to invest in solutions our customers value today and which will further enhance our position for eventual recovery.
Our Completions & Productions Solutions segment generated revenues of $798 million for the third quarter 2015, down 9% sequentially and 33% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Revenues declined across most businesses on lower backlogs and customers delaying pickup of finished work with some offset coming from higher sales, floating production-related equipment and flexible pipe. 
We also saw increased coiled tubing sales as our investments in placing tubing centers closer to our customers' operations enable us to provide better service. Operating profit for the segment was $63 million, resulting in operating margins of 7.9%, down 140 basis points sequentially and 750 basis points year-over-year. 
Sequential decrementals were 24% and third quarter EBITDA for the segment was $117 million or 14.7% of sales. Operating margins were negatively impacted by volume, pricing pressure and product mix, but most cost-control initiatives helped to offset some of the margin decline, resulting in improved decrementals versus prior quarters.
Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for the Completion & Production Solutions. The third quarter saw a much improved order intake of $467 million. That's an increase of $212 million or 83% sequentially, led by improved bookings for floating production relating -- related equipment and fiberglass pipe as well as a large order for subsea flexible pipe. 
We recognized $472 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 99%. Of the $1.2 billion backlog at quarter end, approximately 76% is offshore and 86% is international.
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate demand for our new pressure pumping and coiled tubing unit, especially in North America, will remain low. And while customer interest remains elevated for NOV's more cost-effective solutions in the FPSO space, near term, we anticipate a general slowing in prospect development due to the current commodity price environment. 
We believe revenues will decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage and expect revenue out of backlog to remain in the $450 million to $470 million range. Margins should move down slightly on lower volumes.
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the third quarter, gross margin declined 110 basis points to 21.2%. SG&A decreased 15% or $63 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. 
Other items of $112 million for the quarter resulted primarily from a $55 million pretax intangible asset impairment as well as a $57 million pretax charges associated with severance facility closures and other costs.
Equity income fell to breakeven as demand for OCTGs or green tube associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drill pipe. Other expense for the quarter decreased $10 million sequentially to $20 million, due primarily to a reduction in foreign exchange-related losses relative to the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.8%, down from the 26.9% rate posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Excluding the impact of $112 million in other items, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%, reflective of the continuing high mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions. EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding other items, was $511 million or 15.5% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.9 billion at September 30, 2015, down $206 million or 3% sequentially. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of $222 million reduction in inventory levels, $151 million reduction in accounts receivable, an $88 million increase in accrued taxes and a $10 million decrease in customer financings, which is the net of prepayments and billings in excess of costs against costs in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While we were pleased to see total working capital decrease and we anticipate the pace of cash flow generation from working capital will increase as we move forward, we continue to manage several items impacting our efforts to reduce the capital employed in our business including in-sourcing of machining hours, which increases our inventory by bringing in raw materials, which otherwise would have been held by third-party vendors, customers looking to delay equipment deliveries and extend payment terms and our Rig Systems backlog and its associated customer financings.
Regarding financings. As projects approach their completion, we do anticipate the spread between prepayments and costs in excess of billings to narrow, further contributing to a future reduction of working capital. 
For the quarter, the company generated $410 million in cash flow from operations. Offsetting this cash flow were share repurchases of $444 million, dividend payments of $174 million, investments in our business of $124 million and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $44 million. 
The net impact of our cash flow for the quarter was a $376 million increase in net debt. However, total debt decreased $322 million as we successfully repatriated $1.1 billion to the U.S. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net-to-debt capitalization was 11.8%. 
While we remain focused on managing costs and improving efficiencies, we believe the strength of our enterprise uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on compelling acquisition opportunities that will emerge in this downturn and to continue investing in the development of technologies that will help our customers improve their economics.
With that, we'd like to turn it open to questions."

We report 4 reporting segments and those are comprised really of 15 business units that make those up. And I would say all 15, we continually look for opportunities to enhance and expand. And then beyond that, the great thing about oilfield services is it's composed of dozens and dozens and dozens of interesting subsectors, and so we're continually looking across those for opportunities to deploy capital and develop our business. We also have some great industrial product lines and businesses in markets that we serve. Usually, those are characterized by some sort of overlapping confidence that we have in the oilfield. We make a product, for instance, if the oilfield needs it, it also goes into other industrial segments. So usually, there's some sort of overlap or synergy that's embedded in those sort of opportunities. But yes, we're taking a very expansive view. The reason for the comments, obviously, is a lot of parts of -- well, really all parts of oilfield services and manufacturing under stress in the current environment and landscape shifting, and so at the low points in the cycle's where we frequently see the best opportunities. And as you know, we have a long history of executing acquisitions. And both National Oilwell and Varco came out of private equity roots. And through the years, between our 2 organizations -- we came together about 10 years ago, we've done probably in excess of 300 transactions.

As Jose mentioned, it takes a little more inventory to accomplish. On the fuel cost front, it varies by product line. We've seen dramatic deflation in pipe prices, for instance. On castings and forgings, yes, I think we're seeing the same thing others are, which is a little less deflation. But really across the entire supplier network, we're pressing for lower pricing and continually trying to become more efficient."

We're doing more detailed planning around what 2016 is going to look like, and we always reach out to our customers to kind of get their guidance. And what we're finding is they don't know what they're going to spend. So generally, though, I think the first part of 2016 is going to continue to be really challenging. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our expectation is activity is going to trend lower. I think like everybody in this industry that we remain hopeful we'll get a little bit of commodity price help and relief and then maybe the second half of the year, we start to see maybe activity pick up a little bit. But I don't have a lot of data to point to as to why that would happen. Jose and I were chatting earlier. And Jose, you mentioned the fact that producers come under a lot of pressure when they start facing production declines. And so I think there'll be an impetus at least across North America to get back to drilling as soon as they can. Of course, that will take a while. A lot of the equipment that's out there has been depleted of spare parts and cannibalized, and so a little bit of uptick in activity is going to take a lot of work from NOV. So we're looking forward to that time."

It's expensive to demobilize a string of pipe off of an offshore rig, so a little less impacted from cannibalization there, but certainly, onshore, that's impacted them. The good news is that their mix has improved. We're the market leader in terms of providing premium connections of high tensile strength pipe, set new records in places like Sukkwan Island in terms of extended rigs drilling out 7, 8 miles. And really, broadly speaking, you step back and view this -- the demand for drill pipe -- a lot of technology in drill pipe, and drill pipe is consumed at a much faster rate when it's used to drill these horizontal wells, these long patterns that are really making the shale plays go. So yes, we're in this period when demand is down. Teams have done a great job. They are managing through it. But once we recover, I think a shale phenomenon is going to continue to consume more and more drill pipe that we make."

But -- and I tried to touch on this in my opening remarks, the principles that we apply. Since I've been with the company, we've grown from 2 business units to 15, and I'll reiterate we take a broad view across oilfield services and look for opportunities to deploy capital and develop strategies around things. I'll go back a couple of years and give you a real world example. We launched an FPSO initiative about 4, 5 years ago. And I'll just point out, this is long before anybody was talking about standardization, about industrial efficient supply chain, we were sort of a lone voice on this subject. But we recognized NOV has built, installed and commissioned 300 complicated offshore rigs. We work with every major shipyard out there. We've got great project management expertise, great relationships with every major shipyard around the globe. And these same shipyards were -- customers are very challenged when it comes to building FPSO vessels on time, on budget. Plus, when we looked at our portfolio of product offerings between hose reel systems, offloading systems, cranes, composite piping, production chokes and valves and manifolds and other things, we had a lot of content with FPSO. So we've cultivated an FPSO strategy and said, we have specifics. We're uniquely positioned in terms of our shipyard expertise to execute a strategy of improving FPSO construction, bringing more industrially elegant solutions to the supply chain -- again simplifying, the things that you're hearing a lot more of lately to reduce cost and risk around FPSO construction. And NOV is uniquely positioned with regards to a vessel strategy in the deepwater. And then we've supplemented that with acquisitions along the way, including APL turret mooring systems, one of the best global providers of turret mooring systems in swivel stack technologies with NKT Flexibles, which is now NOV Flexibles, 1 of 3 global providers of flexible pipe, a big component of served packages that sort of fit the strategy. So that's an example of where we're deploying capital to execute a strategy that, I think, is -- has positioned us to be transformative in a significant sector in oilfield services and thereby reduce cost for our customers. So that's an example of the kind of things that we're looking at. And suffice to say in a cyclical downturn, we're continuing to look for other opportunities to deploy capital and develop businesses."

And unfortunately, it's driven by rig count and really, the inverse of rig count, which are stacked rigs. Because the stacked rigs is there -- as activity goes down, then it frees up a string of drill pipe. It frees up the downhole tools that otherwise would be working on that working rig. And so it's very fluid and very difficult to tell frankly, until we hit bottom on activity, and we see a little time pass beyond that, very difficult to tell kind of where that's going to lie. We're seeing customers be far more aggressive, I think, in this downturn with regards to cannibalizing their equipment, about repositioning it. They're getting -- if they have a particular piece of equipment in a different region, there's a cost to repositioning that. There's freight. There's -- they have to invest in that to just to move it and maybe to get it back to working order. And we're seeing customers go to more extraordinary length, I think, in this downturn than we have in the preceding couple of downturns with regards to cannibalization. So there's a very, very Darwinian -- very Draconian move to preserve cash and use what's on hand, and so that we're -- we're seeing that. We do know it will turn around and when it does, one day the phones will light up and people will also need it yesterday. And so that's the other side of this. But we just -- at this point, we don't know when that's going to occur."

First, I have a lot of confidence in our management team there to manage through this. They have done a great job along the way. Second, as I mentioned, we have sort of an outsourcing model within good times and they're doing a great job for scaling back our outside suppliers about in-sourcing or in managing to the volume that's out there. Third, as backlog moves down, there's more flexibility that opens up with regards to steps that they can take. Absorption does become harder, I think, from here on out. And then fourth, I think the wildcard out there sort of remains pricing to some degree, kind of where that lands. So I think it's very difficult, I think, I'd be reluctant to throw a margin number or a range out there right now, other than we're -- as I said many times before, we're going to manage what we can and manage to the market. It may be helpful, too, to point out that our global network within rig of plants and facilities really serve both Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket. The same plants that make components for rigs also make spare parts, and these components are used both offshore and on land. And between Rig Aftermarket continuing demand and ongoing work and ongoing demand for components to replace things that are worn out, replace things that are burned up, to upgrade rigs even in the downturn, you're going to see rigs that need to upgrade certain components in order to qualify for certain work. I think we could keep a decent load on our plants in our core team through that. So that's where we're kind of shifting to as it will slow down a little bit. The other part that I'm probably more optimistic about in terms of demand in rig is we know a number of drilling contractors in North America and around the globe who are completely bought into the idea and the need to upgrade their fleets to AC technology. This is clearly where the market is going. And so I think in terms of recovery, that's where we would see it next."
