Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and touch on some the highlight that helped us deliver full year record segment operating income in 2014. I'll also address our outlook for 2015",2324,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and touch on some the highlight that helped us deliver full year record segment operating income in 2014. I'll also address our outlook for 2015. Laura will follow with a review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
I'm extremely pleased with what our teams in all our regions accomplished over the past year, particularly in light of ongoing global economic volatility, which increased dramatically in the fourth quarter and was amplified by the strengthening U.S. dollar. In North America, our team delivered record earnings for the year. With steady execution of our strategy, North America continued to win with consumers. For example, our Assurance All-Season tire, launched in 2014, will reach 1 million sold faster than any previous new product. Likewise, our commercial truck business had a strong year, as fleets continued to embrace our outstanding products and business solutions model. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire business had year-over-year segment operating income growth of $140 million. Our product leadership in the region was confirmed by regular wins in podium finishes and the important magazine tests, in addition to setting the pace in European tire labeling. Latin America featured a steady rollout of new high-value added Goodyear products that were a hit with our customers. In Brazil and Mexico, we grew share by delivering a double-digit increase in consumer replacement volume, as we've completely revamped our portfolio to take advantage of the MegaTrend shift to HVA products. In the Asia Pacific region, our volume growth in China and India contributed to record earnings in the fourth quarter. Our products won several awards, and we're expanding our distribution to make the most of the opportunities in this growing market. And 2014 marked the continuation of our operational excellence initiative, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through the disciplined execution our strategy, focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand. As you read on our press release, our segment operating income of $1.7 billion was a full year record. It represents an 8% improvement over last year's record performance, a significant accomplishment by any measure, but especially gratifying in the midst of challenging global economic conditions in a number of our key markets. 
In addition, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, marking the second straight year we have reached that level of cash generation. As pleased as I am to report these results, I'll remind you that our strategy is built or the long-term, and our destination is to create sustainable value for our associates, for our customers and for our shareholders alike. We believe in the soundness of our strategy and are committed to it even when economic and industry fluctuations demand that we be flexible in our execution. A great example of our strategy in action is our North America business. North America delivered $229 million in fourth quarter segment operating income, the best performance of any quarter in its history. It was a fitting way to complete a year in which the business reached $803 million of segment operating income, a full year record. North America is clearly on a path of sustainable performance, as it continues to strengthen its earnings and margins as a result of our market back strategy. 
Three weeks ago, our annual North America Dealer Conference had the highest attendance in its history. I came away from that meeting more energized than ever, as our customers were more enthusiastic, more optimistic and more confident than I've ever seen. Many of them, both consumer and commercial truck tire dealers, had very strong years themselves, reflecting the strength of the Goodyear brand in the marketplace and the value of being an aligned Goodyear dealer. I believe we have the best dealer network in industry because they do more than just sell tires. They capture the value of everything Goodyear has to offer. 
As always, new products were one of the main sources of interest and enthusiasm at the conference. This year, we introduced a completely new line of tires for the Kelly brand to complement our lineup of Goodyear passenger and light truck tires. The new Kelly tires are our response to our customers' need for a branded tire as a favorable option to Asian imports of private label tires. Our Kelly lineup reinvigorates a well-known brand that our dealers can sell on its value, not price alone. The number of orders we've taken in advance of the Kelly launch this spring has exceeded our expectation, evidence that these tires will be a hit with our customers. 
Now the biggest news from our dealer conference, which you may have heard about already, was the announcement of our plan to start selling Goodyear consumer replacement tires online in North America at goodyear.com. This is how consumers are shopping for many goods and services already, and it's how we believe they will increasingly shop for tires. This new buying option will allow consumers to purchase tires online and have them installed locally at an authorized Goodyear retailer of their choice. 
Beyond just making industry-leading innovative tires, we are focused on making the tire buying process easier for consumers and creating profitable incremental sales opportunities for our aligned dealers. The program, which will be activated later this year, is a major step for Goodyear and for our network partner dealers. 
As consumers demographics continue to shift and 80 million millennials come into the marketplace, we have to meet their expectations around buying and shopping experiences. By taking the initiative and embracing this digital format to simplify the tire buying process, we believe we will be the industry leader in this space. It's another Goodyear innovation that goes beyond just tires and a tangible example of our focus on our customers and consumers from the market back, rather than from the factory out. 
I'm happy to say that the response from our dealers who are pivotable to the success of this program has been overwhelmingly positive. Our collaboration creates synergies to allow both of our businesses to grow, as consumers buying habits evolve. 
Think about how much our North America business has progressed. We've grown our segment operating income organically from a $300 million loss in 2009 to an $800 million profit in 2014, a $1 billion plus rebound in 5 years. That's a reflection of a sound strategy and winning execution, and we see continued opportunity ahead. 
Now turning to our Asia Pacific business. We delivered a record fourth quarter, as we continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across the region. This was despite ongoing economic headwinds in Australia, where we're still feeling the significant effects of the mining industry slowdown. Our state-of-the-art factory in Pulandian, China is delivering as planned, producing industry-leading product and providing cost efficiencies to help improve our brand strength and support our growth in the region. Innovative products remain a pillar of our strategy, and in China, the Goodyear Wrangler was named All-terrain Tire of the Year, and Goodyear Excellence Run On Flat was cited as the Editor's Choice of the Year by a major Chinese automotive magazine. 
Now even with these successes, a variety of industry and economic headwinds over the course of the year and the quarter changed the playing field in 2014 and will continue to have an impact in 2015. Continued economic and political instability across Europe has affected our business in the region, slowing growth in both Western Europe and emerging markets in the region. In short, Europe continues to model along, not yet setting itself on a course to a stable recovery. 
Venezuela continues to be the most challenging market in Latin America. The economic environment remains difficult, and the political situation continues to be on steady, both clearly affected by the recent decline in oil prices. It's become increasingly difficult to forecast sales, pricing and supply in Venezuela with any degree of certainty. Our Brazil original equipment business continues to weaken, as auto production has yet to rebound from an extremely weak 2014 and the country's economy remains in or near recession. And slower-than-predicted global economic growth and reduced industry sales volumes, particularly outside the U.S., are combining with low material costs to create increasingly competitive environment. But the most significant headwind from 2014 that will carry over and continue to have an impact into the year ahead is unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar. The effective translation of our foreign results obscures the progress and growth in our business. At current spot rates, this is a headwind of $180 million in 2015. While foreign currency headwinds will have a negative effect on segment operating income, our underlying business and operations are more robust than ever. Led by our momentum in North America, we remain committed to our target of 2015 segment operating income growth of 10% to 15% above last year's record. 
So while the headwinds I mentioned are significant and will call for flexibility in our operations, we remain committed to our strategy and long-term goals. The environment is more difficult now than when we set our targets in 2013, but we know that the global tire industry is cyclical, and we are prepared to address it. 
In the year ahead, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for a recovery in weaker markets. We expect global volume growth of 1% to 2% in a tough market but are confident that our commitment to pursuing profitable volume will continue to deliver strong results. We believe the best way to reach our long-term objectives is through continued disciplined execution of the key how-tos of our strategy roadmap. Taken together, these elements will help us reduce the inherent stress or friction in our business and allow us to make it easier for customers to sell Goodyear tires and for consumers to buy Goodyear tires. We will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. Investment in our business will be driven from the market back and geared toward providing the high-value products that differentiate Goodyear in the marketplace. 
We've seen the tangible results from our operational excellence initiatives and will continue our journey to become more efficient in our supply chain, reducing cost and building the capabilities necessary to serve our customers better. And as we have done with operational excellence, we are committed to building a global platform of sales and marketing excellence to take full advantage of our brand and our volume proposition and drive profitable growth. We are just getting started in this area as we pivot to growth. 
The value of our brand has never been stronger even as economic conditions remain unpredictable. Our focus will stay on winning in market segments, where consumers are willing to pay for the value of our brand, our products, our services and the total Goodyear experience. 
To meet the increasing demand of our products, we expect our new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant for Latin America and North America to come online in 2017. This vital new facility will provide us with more of the high-value tires consumers are demanding in those regions. We also are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint to ensure our ability to deliver the right tires at the right costs. Growth CapEx is required to drive our earnings. However, because of the current slower volume growth in some markets, we are adjusting our CapEx investments in the near term, which Laura will describe later. As always, we will take a thoughtful approach to investment, with an eye on projects that have the highest potential return. 
In summary, I believe we are better prepared than ever to handle the volatility in our business. We are mindful of external conditions that affect our business, but we remain committed to profitable growth. We've executed our strategy and made investments in our business to gain a competitive advantage. To increase our competitive advantage in the cyclical tire business, we are increasing our focus on speed and efficiency to better drive our business and improve customer service. There are opportunities across our business to further streamline our operations and improve our processes to better serve our customers and consumers. We'll discuss these opportunities in more detail as we move through the year. 
Looking back on the full year. I'm extremely proud of our teams and our achievements. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy in place and are delivering record profitability through a volatile period of the economic cycle. We're creating sustainable long-term value and will continue to do so through a balance of growth investments and actions to reduce costs. We are planning for the current volatility to stay with us for an extended period of time, but we remain committed to our long-term goals and are confident in our ability to reach them. Our team has worked through the challenging circumstances before and has delivered strong results. That gives me great confidence that we'll be able to do it again. The tire industry does not grow in a straight line, and we won't be distracted by short-term swings in the market. In light of the progress we've made by executing our strategy, I'm pleased with the state of our business as we look ahead to 2015. The power of our brand and the execution of our strategy strengthens our belief that we will continue to increase our earnings and value for shareholders, not only when the times are good, but when they are challenging as well. This is what our strategy was built to do. 
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

I'll also provide specifics regarding our outlook for 2015 before opening the call up for your questions. Tu",2463,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our fourth quarter results and provide more detail on key items in the quarter. I'll also provide specifics regarding our outlook for 2015 before opening the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I would like to highlight a few key items. In the fourth quarter, both our units sold and our net sales were significantly affected by a year-over-year decline in winter tires sold in EMEA, given the unseasonably warm weather in Europe during the quarter. While our winter tires sales through the third quarter were strong, dealer replenishment in the fourth quarter was severely impacted by very weak sellout, which had double-digit declines in some key markets. Our EPS on a diluted basis for the quarter was $7.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, notably the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion, which was originally established in 2002. After significant items, our adjusted EPS was $0.59. More details can be found in the appendix of today's presentation on Slide 26. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks [ph] fourth quarter 2013 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2014. Lower volumes in EMEA in the quarter and unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower production levels year-over-year reduced income by $53 million for the quarter. Milder winter weather in Europe versus last year drove reduced price/mix of $81 million, partially offset by lower raw material cost of $30 million. Driven by our operational excellence initiative, strong cost savings across all of our business units for the quarter of $105 million more than offset the $77 million negative impact of inflation. For the full year, we achieved more than $500 million in cost savings, including $55 million from the closure of our Amiens, France facility and the exit of the farm tire business. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $17 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against almost all other currencies. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $2.2 billion, down from $3 billion at the end of 2013. This reduction reflects fully funding the U.S. hourly pension plan in January of 2014, leaving our global unfunded tension obligation at the end of '14 at $714 million. This obligation is primarily related to our international pension plan and is in line with our previous guidance. Our U.S. pension de-risking strategy is working. While our discount rate in the U.S. declined, thereby increasing our liability, our return on assets successfully offset this change. Separately, at the end of 2014, we made an adjustment to our U.S. pension liabilities to reflect future mortality improvements in our actuarial assumptions. The result was an increase of $285 million in our pension liability. Despite this increase and based on current assumptions, we expect no required contribution for our U.S. plans for the foreseeable future. Our total debt balance was up $145 million at year-end, however, on February 3 of 2015, we repaid $200 million on our U.S. term loan. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the full year 2014, we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, with working capital neither a source nor a use of cash in 2014. The walk from net income also reflects the noncash impact of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion and the Provision for Deferred Income Taxes line. As a final comment on this slide, the Other line of $464 million [ph] includes various noncash items reflected in net income. The most notable of these items is the $200 million in net Venezuela currency losses in 2014. The strength of our cash generation in the first year of our 3-year plan gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our balanced capital allocation plan. We completed $150 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of that plan, bringing our full year share repurchases to $233 million and 8.9 million shares. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America reported quarterly record segment operating income of $229 million and achieved an operating margin of 10.9%, the third quarter in a row at or above 10%. North America benefited from lower raw material cost and lower conversion cost, primarily driven by reduced pension expense during the quarter. North America's volume was down 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our volume was impacted by tariff prebuy activity and challenges in fully meeting the strong demand for our premium HVA tires. As for the prebuy activity, the U.S. consumer replacement industry continued to face disruption from the anticipation of a tariff on consumer tires imported from China. These imports in the fourth quarter remained very strong through November until the announcement of the preliminary countervailing duty rate. In December, the level of imports declined by almost half on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the speculative buying during the second half of 2014, channel inventories remained at high levels, which we expect will impact our volumes in the first half of 2015. 
We also continue to see strong demand for our premium tires. Our back orders for these HVA products remain high. As we outlined on our third quarter call, we are leveraging our global footprint for additional supply and are continuing to invest in our North America production facility to enable us to meet the increased demand for our premium branded tires in 2015. Our North America commercial truck replacement business also continued to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our industry-leading, fuel-efficient drive tire and fleet business solutions strategy leverage the robust industry conditions for significant year-over-year growth. To help continue this growth in 2015, we announced our new Fuel Max LHS steer tire at our dealer conference. This new tire will now allow us to offer the #1 fuel-efficient drive-and-steer tire combination in North America. These types of market back innovative products will continue to allow us to be the leader in premium truck tires in North America. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $30 million in the fourth quarter and a margin of 2.3%. Unseasonably warm temperatures resulted in an 11% decline in the European winter tire industry sell-in in the fourth quarter. This had a direct impact on our volumes and, in turn, our results in EMEA. The overall volume decline impacted EMEA's SOI by approximately $40 million. The combination of warm weather, declining raw material costs, weak sellout and an increased level of imports, mainly in the Eastern countries, drove increased competition in the quarter. Separately, price/mix was negatively impacted by raw material indexed agreements with our OE customers. 
Earlier this year, it finally began to snow across much of Europe. And while we don't anticipate dealers will replenish snow tire inventories during the first quarter, such seasonal weather may benefit sellout and improved inventory levels heading into our normal sell-in season during the third quarter of 2015. 
In commercial truck, we saw the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter after a weak third quarter. Our new products such as the K Max [ph] and Fuel Max, coupled with our service proposition, have enabled us to win new fleet business and gained share in our premium brand. 
In Latin America, our volume increased about 8%. We continue to see strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the continued weakness in the Brazilian OE market. Segment operating income was $20 million for the quarter, $32 million less than the prior year. The decrease in the Latin American results was largely influenced by 3 items: first, $28 million of higher conversion costs due to inflation and lower production volumes; second, $14 million from increased reserves for a value-added tax claim. This item is listed on the fourth quarter adjusted EPS walk on Slide 26; and third, $11 million in foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these 3 items was a benefit of $15 million from price/mix versus raw material costs and $11 million from higher sales volumes during the quarter. 
On the strength of our new product introductions this year in Brazil and improvement in our distribution networks, we are gaining share on increased volumes in the consumer replacement business. Given the weaker real, imports are now significantly more expensive locally. This may facilitate additional opportunities to grow in Brazil in 2015 even if the OE environment remains challenging. 
In Asia Pacific, our fourth quarter volume of 6 million units was 7% higher than a year ago, given our strong double-digit growth in China. Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $80 million in fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase over the prior year. The impact of higher volumes and strong cost savings performance, net of general inflation, was offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The SOI margin in the region increased 15.7%, up significantly from last year's 12.5%. While we see slower growth for the region in the short term versus our original expectations, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
On Slide 13, we have provided our full year modeling assumption for 2015. You'll notice that many of these items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our third quarter call. There are a few notable exceptions, namely an improving price/mix versus raw material picture, offset by incremental headwinds and foreign exchange and a deteriorating environment in Venezuela. Our expectation for price/mix versus raw material cost has improved, largely on the heels of further declines in raw materials and the increased likelihood of a tariff on Chinese tires in the U.S. For the full year, we expect raw materials to be down about 10%, helping drive a 2015 price/mix versus raw material benefit of about $200 million year-over-year. This benefit includes the expectation that OCR will have a relatively neutral impact for 2015 compared to 2014. For a detailed explanation of our raw material benefit calculation, see Appendix Slide 21. 
The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. As Rich noted, we now see a headwind of approximately $180 million from foreign currency translation in 2015. Given the nature of our business and the size of our operation, we have exposure to several key currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which are not only a headwind but a source of uncertainty as well. To assist you in modeling, we have provided a sensitivity analysis for some of our key currencies on Slide 22 in the appendix of today's presentation. 
With respect to Venezuela, based on the protracted challenges and significant economic uncertainty, we are assuming our earnings in Venezuela to be 0 in 2015. For reference, in 2014, Venezuela's operating income was $47 million. For now, our plant to continues to operate, and we continue to sell tires, as we evaluate all options regarding the future direction of our business there. While we don't anticipate a benefit of any earnings in Venezuela in 2015, we expect to grow our total segment operating income 10% to 15% off of our reported 2014 segment operating income of $1.7 billion. We expect sales volume growth of 1% to 2% for 2015. However, given the prebuy in 2014 in North America related to the potential tariff on imported tires and our plans to increase supply of premium tires in the U.S., we anticipate that the majority of our volume growth in North America will occur in the second half of 2015. That said, we expect the financial impact of the decrease in our tire production volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, to impact Q1 by about $30 million. Overall, we expect unabsorbed overhead to be neutral for the full year versus 2014. 
We expect our cost savings initiative to exceed the impact of general inflation by approximately $160 million, with potential upside led the our operational excellence program. We expect savings from the Amiens, France closure and the related exit from the European farm tire business to generate approximately $20 million of incremental savings in the first half of 2015, with most of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. Taken together with the $55 million benefit we saw in 2014, this would bring the annualized benefit to approximately $75 million, consistent with our prior outlook. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14. With the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance, we estimate our tax rate to be about 30% of our global pretax operating income for 2015. Our cash tax rate for 2015 will remain much lower at about 15% of global pretax operating income, as we do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. for about the next 5 years. We expect global pension expense of $125 million to $175 million and global pension contribution of $50 million to $75 million, all of which will be directed to our international plans. As was the case in 2014, we expect our working capital to be neither a source nor a use of cash in 2015. We are reducing our planned CapEx spend by about $350 million over the next 2 years, in light of lower than previously expected growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $1.1 billion and our 2016 CapEx spend to be about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We will continue to invest where we see strong demand for our product. This includes investments in our new manufacturing facility to support the Americas, which will come online in early 2017. 
Our earnings growth targets continue to support our balanced capital allocation plan. With capital expenditures lower by about $350 million over the next 2 years, we expect to be able to reallocate additional cash through our shareholder return program, contingent on our performance and our delivering on our financial targets. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation plan that provides for capital investments for future earnings growth, achieving an investment-grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. So as we look at 2015, the benefit from lower raw material cost, solid economic trends in North America and continued cost savings performance are expected to be partially offset by a more difficult international environment, including a stronger U.S. dollar globally. While the landscape has changed since we first communicated our 3-year targets back in 2013, our plans continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth in 2015 and 2016.

And you may recall, we've talked about it in the past, when we had the 4 21 [ph] action that took place relative to Chinese imports in North America, we kind of had a bit of a perfect storm, particularly in Brazil, where we had a very strong currency. And we saw available tires, if you will, and we saw Chinese imports in Brazil go up dramatically based on their availability and, again, the strength of the currency. So that phenomena did happen last time. I would suggest to you at this time, it's a bit early to tell. I will say, you heard Laura made a comment in her remarks that we are seeing increased flow of Chinese tires in Asian imports into particularly Eastern Europe. So certainly, I would suggest there's probably some corollary there. I think as we get into '15, we'll have to see how the product flows move. But we did see that already in Q4, and I imagine there is some sort of Nexus between those. In terms of -- and by the way, we will watch that very closely around the world. But I will tell you how we build that into our business going forward. That low end of the market, by in large, is not a market where we have played. Our value proposition, as you've heard us talk about, is playing in those targeted market segments, where we can capture the value of the Goodyear brand. Certainly, our North America business has been on the forefront of that, but also, that's true in our Asian businesses, in our Latin America business, increasingly so, and in Europe as well. So while those tires will come in at the low end, and clearly, by definition, they're going to have an impact, remember, that's not the real part of the market that we tend to play in. So that's how I would have you think about it."

I was very pleased that now, multiple years in a row, we're getting cost savings ahead of inflation. And that's been really linked back to something that we did -- we started, frankly, when I took the job a while back, our operational excellence initiatives in driving efficiencies through our business. And I would say, the result is what you're seeing. And remember, that's a variety programs through material substitutions of to enhanced -- more effective purchasing, let's say, through getting our plans to run more efficiently, by getting more production out of those factories at the same or lower cost; and driving in very specific programs, driving a One Goodyear way system throughout our manufacturing footprint around the globe; and driving it through transportation and warehousing to make sure that we're getting the right tires to the right customers at the right time. All of those programs, I would say, will continue into 2015. And they'll continue beyond that. And I would say, we're really just getting started in terms of driving these programs throughout the world. So you saw in our guidance, I think Laura mentioned, we're forecasting about the same cost outs -- net cost out in 2015 as we did in 2014, about $165 million. That said, you can be pretty sure that our internal goals are to deliver more than that, although we certainly know the global economy is driving a few headwinds as well."

I would say, as we think about volumes for 2015, maybe just to start with that, and certainly, Laura can jump in here as well, I would say that one of the elements driving headwinds in volume in 2015 is our European business. And remember, what we have going on there is not only a more difficult economy at this point, but we have sort of the ever-present impact of warm winters. And as we look at 2015, while we see some growth in the summer markets, what's going to happen again with now our third consecutive, in essence, warm winter in Europe, we have a combination of the channels still being relatively full. And maybe if I go back, just to shed a little bit more light on it, we plan for a green winter in 2014 -- excuse me, 2014. So we didn't plan on it being very robust. What we got is -- what we've internally sort of referred to is now a yellow winter because we saw sunshine in October and November. So what happened is we had the channels full and very little sellout going on, and that's continuing so far into 2015. We've got some warm weather there. But what's going to happen is those channels are going to remain full. As we look at winter industry in 2015, we see it actually decreasing again. And on top of the decreasing industry, as dealers now have dealt with 3 years of green winters, psychologically, they're last inclined, if you will, to go along on winter tires in anticipation of snow. So those 2 headwinds say that the Europe market -- remember, the winter tires are about 30% of the market there, will put a headwind on volume. And those are -- Europe is a big market for us, so by the numbers, that impacts our volume growth. So I would say, we look at other markets, particularly Latin America and Asia. You've heard us say we had double-digit growth in volume in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. And that's the first time we've done that in quite some time. So we're very pleased with the volume and share gains we've got there. Our volumes in Asia, let's say, x Australia, are also still growing at a very good pace. And with a more robust economy in North America, with miles driven up, with new car sales up, with sort of a more positive consumer sentiment and with a combination of what is our best product portfolio ever and, on top of that, the selectivity strategy we had in OE now, a couple of 3 years old, getting on those good fitment, those cars are no going to roll into the replacement dealers to get replaced as well. So we see opportunity in North America as well. So from a volume perspective, roll that up, we're sort of on that 1% to 2% volume growth in 2015."

This is really incredibly helpful in understanding better the dynamics here. Actually, I wanted to ask you about just a little bit more on that. The -- when I look at your raw materials assumption, it looks like, essentially, you're expecting about a 10% decline in overall raw materials cost. But the way it's modeled seems to be like about an 18% decline in your commodity cost. And I wanted to ask you, where does the 18% essentially come from? Is it assuming that's the current spot rates continue? Is there an easy rule of thumb in terms of, okay, if oil prices come down by certain amount, this is where our materials Bill will sort of end up? And then on the second part of the equation. So raw materials is about $600 million tailwind, which implies you're planning for the gross pricing to be sort of like down $400 million in 2015. That seems to be the same performance as what you did in '14, despite a potential help from the Chinese tariffs. So can you maybe also reconcile how you're thinking about pricing for 2015?"

Those are think like R&D and conversion cost and the profits for the vendor as we go. And that helps to really walk US down to that 10%.

As you know, it's something that we look at in the aggregate. And I will tell you, clearly, our North America business has an opportunity in that number for increased price/mix over raw materials in 2015. And Rod, I think, you're right to point out. I think Laura said in her script a bit as well is that the price/mix equation versus raw materials in some of international markets is more challenged by a number of reasons or for a number of reasons, I would say. And one of those certainly is the decrease in raw materials turning up in our raw material indices or our RMI contracts with the OEMs and with fleets that, as you know, work up, and in this case, they worked down as prices go down. Secondly as we looked around the world, what we see are more competitive pressures in some of the sort of emerging market, low-growth countries now outside the U.S., in particular here, where we see more of the Asian imports that we see coming in like in Eastern Europe that Laura mentioned earlier, and you pair that up with sort of the depreciating foreign currencies they have. As they buy raw materials or dollar-based raw materials, they become more expensive. In those competitive markets, what you see is a more difficult price/mix versus raw materials in those places as well. And then, something, Rod, you're familiar with as well, as we look around the world, we have that lag impact of when those decreasing raw material prices actually come into our cost of goods sold. And clearly, we sort of catch up over time. But that has a headwind as we look around the world in those competitive markets as well. But again, I would go back to the fact that over a long period of time, we have a very good track record of managing effectively the price/mix versus raw materials. We did it when raw materials were increasing 25%, 30% a year. And clearly, our intent is to manage that, as we look at the environment we're in right now. And as you rightly point out, we have a positive opportunity to take advantage of that in North America as well."

How do we kind of square that against the 1% decline, especially considering that within North America, you're like 70% HVA? How should we be thinking about your performance here?

So Rod, maybe, let's take North America and Europe separately.

So Rod, maybe, let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some 25% increase in Chinese tire volumes coming in ahead of the potential tariffs coming into place. And in Q4, we saw, albeit to a lesser degree, the same thing happen in October and November, with the decrease coming in in December. I think that decrease was almost like 40% as we went. So that tariff impact is still sort of clouding what's really happening in the market. So to your point of -- it's hard to really see what's going on. I would tell you, in that market, we have stayed true to our North America strategy or our company strategy of staying focused on our targeted marketing segments, where we can maximize the value of the Goodyear brand. Even in that tough market, we haven't changed and said, ""Hey, the market's growing. Let's just go sell more tires for volume for volume's sake."" We haven't done that, and you see that in record fourth quarter. And you see that a record full year results. So we're managing it very well. Now having said that, Rod, to your point, as good as we feel about managing it, we still have more demand for those HVA tires that we're not fulfilling at the moment. So that's something that we're sort of laser-focused on. And what we're doing to get more tires to our customers, we're getting more out of the existing North America footprint we have from our operational excellence initiative, we're investing in our North America factories already with the CapEx we have to get more HVA tires out of them. We're also leveraging our footprint and shipping more tires, those HVA tires in as we have some excess capacity around the world. And finally, albeit a longer-term solution, we're investing in the Americas factory for both HVA in Latin America and in North America. So clearly, we still have more work to do on there as we go. But the positive, we're selling into a growth environment, we're very, very well positioned to go do that. As regard Europe, Rod, I would say, the European situation, again, was a bit skewed by winter. If we look through the third quarter year-to-date, frankly, I was very pleased with both our volume and share position, particularly as we looked at the winter markets. We were ahead in both. We were ahead of the industry in both. And that's sort of a -- gave all the way back in Q4, where because we had sold in early and there wasn't that much sell-out happening, we saw others actually selling more into the market in the fourth quarter, where we didn't because we already had a shelf space or inventory in those channels, if you will. So we gave back some of the share gains we had in the first 3 quarters of the year. On a full year basis, we were essentially fine. And I think, this winter skew, I think in other way to think about it, albeit it's a pro forma way, and I'll say someday, it'll happen. I hope I'm here to share in it as well. Can we have snow in the fourth quarter? We were extremely well positioned in terms of being on the shelves and having podium-winning product to sel lout. In a green winter, a yellow winter, as we said, I think we had record warm days in October and November. It didn't happen, and thus, we had the situation that your for to in Europe right now. So yes, it is complicated, and this is skewed by the weather, but frankly, this reality what happened."

And I think you're right point out that some of those positive momentum is sort of muted by what our 2 very, very significant headwinds, and of course, foreign currency is something that we're going to continue to watch. That's a current spot rates. But we don't know where those will go. And obviously, in Venezuela, we continue to monitor that literally on a daily basis to determine what our next steps as we move ahead in Venezuela. So there are commitments in there that, I think, we shouldn't lose sight of in terms of working our way through 2015."

275789,283618761,763837,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2015",2015-02-17,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and touch on some of the highlights that helped us deliver full year record segment operating income in 2014. I'll also address our outlook for",2323,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and touch on some of the highlights that helped us deliver full year record segment operating income in 2014. I'll also address our outlook for 2015. Laura will follow with a review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
I'm extremely pleased with what our teams in all our regions accomplished over the past year, particularly in light of ongoing global economic volatility, which increased dramatically in the fourth quarter and was amplified by the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
In North America, our team delivered record earnings for the year. With steady execution of our strategy, North America continued to win with consumers. For example, our Assurance All-Season tire, launched in 2014, will reach 1 million sold faster than any previous new product. Likewise, our commercial truck business had a strong year as fleets continued to embrace our outstanding products and business solutions model. 
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business had year-over-year segment operating income growth of $140 million. Our product leadership in the region was confirmed by regular wins in podium finishes and the important magazine tests, in addition to setting the pace in European tire labeling. 
Latin America featured a steady rollout of new high-value added Goodyear products that were a hit with our customers. In Brazil and Mexico, we grew share by delivering a double-digit increase in consumer replacement volume as we've completely revamped our portfolio to take advantage of the MegaTrend shift to HVA products. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, our volume growth in China and India contributed to record earnings in the fourth quarter. Our products won several awards, and we're expanding our distribution to make the most of the opportunities in this growing market. 
And 2014 marked the continuation of our operational excellence initiative, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through the disciplined execution of our strategy, focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand. As you read in our press release, our segment operating income of $1.7 billion was a full year record. It represents an 8% improvement over last year's record performance, a significant accomplishment by any measure but especially gratifying in the midst of challenging global economic conditions in a number of our key markets.  In addition, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, marking the second straight year we have reached that level of cash generation. 
As pleased as I am to report these results, I'll remind you that our strategy is built for the long term, and our destination is to create sustainable value for our associates, for our customers and for our shareholders alike. We believe in the soundness of our strategy and are committed to it even when economic and industry fluctuations demand that we be flexible in our execution. 
A great example of our strategy in action is our North America business. North America delivered $229 million in fourth quarter segment operating income, the best performance of any quarter in its history. It was a fitting way to complete a year in which the business reached $803 million of segment operating income, a full year record. North America is clearly on a path of sustainable performance as it continues to strengthen its earnings and margins as a result of our market-back strategy. 
Three weeks ago, our Annual North America Dealer Conference had the highest attendance in its history. I came away from that meeting more energized than ever as our customers were more enthusiastic, more optimistic and more confident than I've ever seen. Many of them, both consumer and commercial truck tire dealers, had very strong years themselves, reflecting the strength of the Goodyear brand in the marketplace and the value of being an aligned Goodyear dealer. I believe we have the best dealer network in the industry because they do more than just sell tires. They capture the value of everything Goodyear has to offer. 
As always, new products were one of the main sources of interest and enthusiasm at the conference. This year, we introduced a completely new line of tires for the Kelly brand to complement our lineup of Goodyear passenger and light truck tires. The new Kelly tires are our response to our customers' need for a branded tire as a favorable option to Asian imports of private label tires. Our Kelly lineup reinvigorates a well-known brand that our dealers can sell on its value, not price alone. The number of orders we've taken in advance of the Kelly launch this spring has exceeded our expectation, evidence that these tires will be a hit with our customers. 
Now the biggest news from our dealer conference, which you may have heard about already, was the announcement of our plan to start selling Goodyear consumer replacement tires online in North America at goodyear.com. This is how consumers are shopping for many goods and services already, and it's how we believe they will increasingly shop for tires. This new buying option will allow consumers to purchase tires online and have them installed locally at an authorized Goodyear retailer of their choice. 
Beyond just making industry-leading innovative tires, we are focused on making the tire-buying process easier for consumers and creating profitable incremental sales opportunities for our aligned dealers. The program, which will be activated later this year, is a major step for Goodyear and for our network partner dealers. 
As consumer demographics continue to shift and 80 million millennials come into the marketplace, we have to meet their expectations around buying and shopping experiences. By taking the initiative and embracing this digital format to simplify the tire-buying process, we believe we will be the industry leader in this space. It's another Goodyear innovation that goes beyond just tires and a tangible example of our focus on our customers and consumers from the market back rather than from the factory out. 
I'm happy to say that the response from our dealers who are pivotable to the success of this program has been overwhelmingly positive. Our collaboration creates synergies to allow both of our businesses to grow as consumers' buying habits evolve. 
Think about how much our North America business has progressed. We've grown our segment operating income organically from a $300 million loss in 2009 to an $800 million profit in 2014, a $1 billion-plus rebound in 5 years. That's a reflection of a sound strategy and winning execution, and we see continued opportunity ahead. 
Now turning to our Asia-Pacific business. We delivered a record fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across the region. This was despite ongoing economic headwinds in Australia, where we're still feeling the significant effects of the mining industry slowdown. Our state-of-the-art factory in Pulandian, China is delivering as planned, producing industry-leading products and providing cost efficiencies to help increase our brand strength and support our growth in the region. Innovative products remain a pillar of our strategy, and in China, the Goodyear Wrangler was named All-terrain Tire of the Year, and Goodyear Excellence Run On Flat was cited as the Editor's Choice of the Year by a major Chinese automotive magazine. 
Now even with these successes, a variety of industry and economic headwinds over the course of the year and the quarter changed the playing field in 2014 and will continue to have an impact in 2015. Continued economic and political instability across Europe has affected our business in the region, slowing growth in both Western Europe and emerging markets in the region. In short, Europe continues to model along, not yet setting itself on a course to a stable recovery. 
Venezuela continues to be the most challenging market in Latin America. The economic environment remains difficult, and the political situation continues to be on steady, both clearly affected by the recent decline in oil prices. It has become increasingly difficult to forecast sales, pricing and supply in Venezuela with any degree of certainty. Our Brazil original equipment business continues to weaken as auto production has yet to rebound from an extremely weak 2014 and the country's economy remains in or near recession. 
And slower-than-predicted global economic growth and reduced industry sales volumes, particularly outside the U.S., are combining with low raw material costs to create increasingly competitive environments. But the most significant headwind from 2014 that will carry over and continue to have an impact into the year ahead is unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar. The effective translation of our foreign results obscures the progress and growth in our business. At current spot rates, this is a headwind of $180 million in 2015. While foreign currency headwinds will have a negative effect on segment operating income, our underlying business and operations are more robust than ever. Led by our momentum in North America, we remain committed to our target of 2015 segment operating income growth of 10% to 15% above last year's record. 
So while the headwinds I mentioned are significant and will call for flexibility in our operations, we remain committed to our strategy and long-term goals. The environment is more difficult now than when we set our targets in 2013, but we know that the global tire industry is cyclical, and we are prepared to address it. 
In the year ahead, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for a recovery in weaker markets. We expect global volume growth of 1% to 2% in a tough market but are confident that our commitment to pursuing profitable volume will continue to deliver strong results. We believe the best way to reach our long-term objectives is through continued disciplined execution of the key how-tos of our strategy roadmap. Taken together, these elements will help us reduce the inherent stress or friction in our business and allow us to make it easier for customers to sell Goodyear tires and for consumers to buy Goodyear tires. We will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. Investment in our business will be driven from the market back and geared toward providing the high-value products that differentiate Goodyear in the marketplace. 
We've seen the tangible results from our operational excellence initiatives and will continue our journey to become more efficient in our supply chain, reducing cost and building the capabilities necessary to serve our customers better. And as we have done with operational excellence, we are committed to building a global platform of sales and marketing excellence to take full advantage of our brand and our value proposition and drive profitable growth. We are just getting started in this area as we pivot to growth. 
The value of our brand has never been stronger even as economic conditions remain unpredictable. Our focus will stay on winning in the market segments where consumers are willing to pay for the value of our brand, our products, our services and the total Goodyear experience. 
To meet the increasing demand of our products, we expect our new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant for Latin America and North America to come online in 2017. This vital new facility will provide us with more of the high-value tires consumers are demanding in those regions. We also are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint to ensure our ability to deliver the right tires at the right cost. Growth CapEx is required to drive our earnings. However, because of the current slower volume growth in some markets, we are adjusting our CapEx investments in the near term, which Laura will describe later. As always, we will take a thoughtful approach to investment, with an eye on projects that have the highest potential return. 
In summary, I believe we are better prepared than ever to handle the volatility in our business. We're mindful of external conditions that affect our business, but we remain committed to profitable growth. We've executed our strategy and made investments in our business to gain a competitive advantage. To increase our competitive advantage in the cyclical tire business, we are increasing our focus on speed and efficiency to better drive our business and improve customer service. There are opportunities across our business to further streamline our operations and improve our processes to better serve our customers and consumers. We'll discuss these opportunities in more detail as we move through the year. 
Looking back on the full year, I'm extremely proud of our teams and our achievements. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy in place and are delivering record profitability through a volatile period of the economic cycle. We're creating sustainable long-term value and will continue to do so through a balance of growth investments and actions to reduce costs. We are planning for the current volatility to stay with us for an extended period of time, but we remain committed to our long-term goals and are confident in our ability to reach them. Our team has worked through the challenging circumstances before and has delivered strong results. That gives me great confidence that we'll be able to do it again. The tire industry does not grow in a straight line, and we won't be distracted by short-term swings in the market. In light of the progress we've made by executing our strategy, I'm pleased with the state of our business as we look ahead to 2015. The power of our brand and the execution of our strategy strengthens our belief that we will continue to increase our earnings and value for shareholders, not only when the times are good but when they are challenging as well. This is what our strategy was built to do. 
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our fourth quarter results and provide more detail on key items in the quarter. I'll also provide specifics regarding our outlook for 2015 before opening the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I would like to highlight a few key items. In the fourth quarter, both our units sold and our net sales were significantly affected by a year-over-year decline in winter tires sold in EMEA given the unseasonably warm weather in Europe during the quarter. While our winter tires sales through the third quarter were strong, dealer replenishment in the fourth quarter was severely impacted by very weak sellout, which had double-digit declines in some key markets. Our EPS on a diluted basis for the quarter was $7.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, notably the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion, which was originally established in 2002. After significant items, our adjusted EPS was $0.59. More details can be found in the appendix of today's presentation on Slide 26. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks fourth quarter 2013 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2014. Lower volumes in EMEA in the quarter and unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower production levels year-over-year reduced income by $53 million for the quarter. Milder winter weather in Europe versus last year drove reduced price/mix of $81 million, partially offset by lower raw material cost of $30 million. Driven by our operational excellence initiative's strong cost savings across all of our business units for the quarter of $105 million more than offset the $77 million negative impact of inflation. For the full year, we achieved more than $500 million in cost savings, including $55 million from the closure of our Amiens, France facility and the exit of the farm tire business. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $17 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against almost all other currencies. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $2.2 billion, down from $3 billion at the end of 2013. This reduction reflects fully funding the U.S. hourly pension plan in January of 2014, leaving our global unfunded pension obligation at the end of '14 at $714 million. This obligation is primarily related to our international pension plans and is in line with our previous guidance. Our U.S. pension de-risking strategy is working. While our discount rate in the U.S. declined, thereby increasing our liability, our return on assets successfully offset this change. Separately, at the end of 2014, we made an adjustment to our U.S. pension liabilities to reflect future mortality improvements in our actuarial assumptions. The result was an increase of $285 million in our pension liability. Despite this increase and based on current assumptions, we expect no required contribution for our U.S. plans for the foreseeable future. Our total debt balance was up $145 million at year-end, however, on February 3 of 2015, we repaid $200 million on our U.S. term loan. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the full year 2014, we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, with working capital neither a source nor a use of cash in 2014. The walk from net income also reflects the noncash impact of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion in the Provision for Deferred Income Taxes line. As a final comment on this slide, the Other line of $464 million includes various noncash items reflected in net income. The most notable of these items is the $200 million in net Venezuela currency losses in 2014. The strength of our cash generation in the first year of our 3-year plan gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our balanced capital allocation plan. We completed $150 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of that plan, bringing our full year share repurchases to $233 million and 8.9 million shares. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America reported quarterly record segment operating income of $229 million and achieved an operating margin of 10.9%, the third quarter in a row at or above 10%. North America benefited from lower raw material cost and lower conversion cost, primarily driven by reduced pension expense during the quarter. North America's volume was down 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our volume was impacted by tariff prebuy activity and challenges in fully meeting the strong demand for our premium HVA tires. As for the prebuy activity, the U.S. consumer replacement industry continued to face disruption from the anticipation of a tariff on consumer tires imported from China. These imports in the fourth quarter remained very strong through November, until the announcement of the preliminary countervailing duty rates. In December, the level of imports declined by almost half on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the speculative buying during the second half of 2014, channel inventories remain at high levels, which we expect will impact our volumes in the first half of 2015. 
We also continue to see strong demand for our premium tires. Our back orders for these HVA products remain high. As we outlined on our third quarter call, we are leveraging our global footprint for additional supply and are continuing to invest in our North America production facility to enable us to meet the increased demand for our premium branded tires in 2015. 
Our North America commercial truck replacement business also continued to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our industry-leading, fuel-efficient drive tire and fleet business solutions strategy leveraged the robust industry conditions for significant year-over-year growth. To help continue this growth in 2015, we announced our new Fuel Max LHS steer tire at our dealer conference. This new tire will now allow us to offer the #1 fuel-efficient drive-and-steer tire combination in North America. These types of market-back innovative products will continue to allow us to be the leader in premium truck tires in North America. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $30 million in the fourth quarter and a margin of 2.3%. Unseasonably warm temperatures resulted in an 11% decline in the European winter tire industry sell-in in the fourth quarter. This had a direct impact on our volumes and, in turn, our results in EMEA. The overall volume decline impacted EMEA's SOI by approximately $40 million. The combination of warm weather, declining raw material costs, weak sellout and an increased level of imports, mainly in the Eastern countries, drove increased competition in the quarter. Separately, price/mix was negatively impacted by raw material indexed agreements with our OE customers. 
Earlier this year, it finally began to snow across much of Europe. And while we don't anticipate dealers will replenish snow tire inventories during the first quarter, such seasonal weather may benefit sellout and improve inventory levels heading into our normal sell-in season during the third quarter of 2015. 
In commercial truck, we saw the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter after a weak third quarter. Our new products such as the K MAX and Fuel Max, coupled with our service proposition, have enabled us to win new fleet business and gain share in our premium brand. 
In Latin America, our volume increased about 8%. We continue to see strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the continued weakness in the Brazilian OE market. Segment operating income was $20 million for the quarter, $32 million less than the prior year. The decrease in the Latin American results was largely influenced by 3 items: first, $28 million in higher conversion costs due to inflation and lower production volumes; second, $14 million from increased reserves for a value-added tax claim. This item is listed on the fourth quarter adjusted EPS walk on Slide 26. And third, $11 million in foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these 3 items were the benefits of $15 million from price/mix versus raw material costs and $11 million from higher sales volumes during the quarter. 
On the strength of our new product introductions this year in Brazil and improvements in our distribution network, we are gaining share on increased volumes in the consumer replacement business. Given the weaker real, imports are now significantly more expensive locally. This may facilitate additional opportunities to grow in Brazil in 2015 even if the OE environment remains challenging. 
In Asia-Pacific, our fourth quarter volume of 6 million units was 7% higher than a year ago, given our strong double-digit growth in China. Our Asia-Pacific business reported segment operating income of $80 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase over the prior year. The impact of higher volumes and strong cost savings performance, net of general inflation, was offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The SOI margin in the region increased 15.7%, up significantly from last year's 12.5%. While we see slower growth for the region in the short term versus our original expectations, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
On Slide 13, we have provided our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that many of these items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our third quarter call. There are a few notable exceptions, namely an improving price/mix versus raw material picture, offset by incremental headwinds in foreign exchange and a deteriorating environment in Venezuela. Our expectation for price/mix versus raw material cost has improved, largely on the heels of further declines in raw materials and the increased likelihood of a tariff on Chinese tires in the U.S. For the full year, we expect raw materials to be down about 10%, helping drive a 2015 price/mix versus raw material benefit of about $200 million year-over-year. This benefit includes the expectation that OTR will have a relatively neutral impact for 2015 compared to 2014. For a detailed explanation of our raw material benefit calculation, see Appendix Slide 21. 
The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. As Rich noted, we now see a headwind of approximately $180 million from foreign currency translation in 2015. Given the nature of our business and the size of our operation, we have exposure to several key currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which are not only a headwind but a source of uncertainty as well. To assist you in modeling, we have provided a sensitivity analysis for some of our key currencies on Slide 22, in the appendix of today's presentation. 
With respect to Venezuela, based on the protracted challenges and significant economic uncertainty, we are assuming our earnings in Venezuela to be 0 in 2015. For reference, in 2014, Venezuela's operating income was $47 million. For now, our plant continues to operate, and we continue to sell tires as we evaluate all options regarding the future direction of our business there. While we don't anticipate a benefit of any earnings in Venezuela in 2015, we expect to grow our total segment operating income 10% to 15% off of our reported 2014 segment operating income of $1.7 billion. We expect sales volume growth of 1% to 2% for 2015. However, given the prebuy in 2014 in North America related to the potential tariff on imported tires and our plans to increase supply of premium tires in the U.S., we anticipate that the majority of our volume growth in North America will occur in the second half of 2015. That said, we expect the financial impact of the decrease in our tire production volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, to impact Q1 by about $30 million. Overall, we expect unabsorbed overhead to be neutral for the full year versus 2014.
We expect our cost savings initiative to exceed the impact of general inflation by approximately $160 million, with potential upside led by our operational excellence program. We expect savings from the Amiens, France closure and related exit from the European farm tire business to generate approximately $20 million of incremental savings in the first half of 2015, with most of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. Taken together with the $55 million benefit we saw in 2014, this would bring the annualized benefit to approximately $75 million, consistent with our prior outlook. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14. With the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance, we estimate our tax rate to be about 30% of our global pretax operating income for 2015. Our cash tax rate for 2015 will remain much lower at about 15% of global pretax operating income as we do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. for about the next 5 years. We expect global pension expense of $125 million to $175 million and global pension contribution of $50 million to $75 million, all of which will be directed to our international plan. As was the case in 2014, we expect our working capital to be neither a source nor a use of cash in 2015. We are reducing our planned CapEx spend by about $350 million over the next 2 years, in light of lower than previously expected growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $1.1 billion and our 2016 CapEx spend to be about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We will continue to invest where we see strong demand for our products. These include investments in our new manufacturing facility to support the Americas, which will come online in early 2017. 
Our earnings growth targets continue to support our balanced capital allocation plan. With capital expenditures lower by about $350 million over the next 2 years, we expect to be able to reallocate additional cash through our shareholder return program, contingent on our performance and our delivering on our financial targets. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation plan that provides for capital investments for future earnings growth, achieving an investment-grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. So as we look at 2015, the benefits from lower raw materia costs, solid economic trends in North America and continued cost savings performance are expected to be partially offset by a more difficult international environment, including a stronger U.S. dollar globally. While the landscape has changed since we first communicated our 3-year targets back in 2013, our plans continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth in 2015 and 2016.

I will tell you I think your assumption, to start with, is a good one, that product will flow somewhere if it doesn't come to the U.S. in this case. So those tires will end up somewhere. And you may recall, we've talked about it in the past, when we had the 421 action that took place relative to Chinese imports into North America. We kind of had a bit of a perfect storm, particularly in Brazil, where we had a very strong currency. And we saw available tires, if you will, and we saw Chinese imports in Brazil go up dramatically based on their availability and, again, the strength of the currency. So that phenomenon did happen last time. I would suggest to you at this time, it's a bit early to tell. I will say, you heard Laura made a comment in her remarks that we are seeing increased flow of Chinese tires and Asian imports into particularly Eastern Europe. So certainly, I would suggest there's probably some corollary there. I think as we get into '15, we'll have to see how the product flows move. But we did see that already in Q4, and I imagine there is some sort of nexus between those. In terms of -- and by the way, we will watch that very closely around the world. But I will tell you how we build that into our business going forward. That low end of the market, by and large, is not a market where we have played. Our value proposition, as you've heard us talk about, is playing in those targeted market segments where we can capture the value of the Goodyear brand. Certainly, our North America business has been on the forefront of that, but also, that's true in our Asian businesses, in our Latin America businesses, increasingly so, and in Europe as well. So while those tires will come in at the low end, and clearly, by definition, they're going to have an impact, remember, that's not the real part of the market that we tend to play in. So that's how I'd have you think about it."

I was very pleased that now, multiple years in a row, we're getting cost savings ahead of inflation. And that's been really linked back to something that we did -- we started, frankly, when I took the job a while back, our operational excellence initiatives in driving efficiency through our business. And I would say the result is what you're seeing. And remember, that's a variety of programs: through material substitutions to enhance the -- more effective purchasing, let's say; through getting our plants to run more efficiently by getting more production out of those factories at the same or lower cost; and driving very specific programs, driving a One Goodyear Way system throughout our manufacturing footprint around the globe; and driving it through transportation and warehousing to make sure that we're getting the right tires to the right customers at the right time. All those programs, I would say, will continue into 2015, and they'll continue beyond that. And I would say we're really just getting started in terms of driving these programs throughout the world. So you saw in our guidance -- I think Laura mentioned we're forecasting about the same cost outs -- net cost out in 2015 as we did in 2014, about $165 million. That said, you can be pretty sure that our internal goals are to deliver more than that, although we certainly know the global economy is driving a few headwinds as well."

I just want to get your thoughts on that."

I would say as we think about volumes for 2015, maybe just to start with that, and certainly, Laura can jump in here as well, I would say that one of the elements driving headwinds in volume in 2015 is our European business. And remember, what we have going on there is not only a more difficult economy at this point, but we have sort of the ever-present impact of warm winters. And as we look at 2015, while we see some growth in the summer markets, what's going to happen again with now our third consecutive, in essence, warm winter in Europe, we have a combination of the channels still being relatively full. And maybe if I go back just to shed a little bit more light on it, we planned for a green winter in 2014, so we didn't plan on it being very robust. What we got is -- what we've internally sort of referred to is now a yellow winter because we saw sunshine in October and November. So what happened is we had the channels full and very little sellout going on, and that's continuing so far into 2015. We've got some warm weather there. But what's going to happen is those channels are going to remain full. As we look at winter industry in 2015, we see it actually decreasing again. And on top of a decreasing industry, as dealers now have dealt with 3 years of green winters, psychologically, they're less inclined, if you will, to go long on winter tires in anticipation of snow. So those 2 headwinds say that the Europe market, remember, the winter tires are about 30% of the market there, will put a headwind on volume. And those are -- Europe is a big market for us, so by the numbers, that impacts our volume growth. I would say we look at other markets, particularly Latin America and Asia. You've heard us say we had double-digit growth in volume in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. And that's the first time we've done that in quite some time, so we're very pleased with the volume and share gains we've got there. Our volumes in Asia, let's say, x Australia, are also still growing at a very good pace. And with a more robust economy in North America, with miles driven up, with new car sales up, with sort of a more positive consumer sentiment and with a combination of what is our best product portfolio ever and, on top of that, the selectivity strategy we have at OE now, a couple of 3 years old, getting on those good fitments, those cars are now going to roll into the replacement dealers to get replaced as well. So we see opportunity in North America as well. So from a volume perspective, roll that up, we're sort of on that 1% to 2% volume growth in 2015."

This is really incredibly helpful in understanding better the dynamics here. Actually, I wanted to ask you about -- just a little bit more on that. When I look at your raw materials assumption, it looks like essentially, you're expecting about a 10% decline in overall raw materials cost. But the way it's modeled seems to be like about an 18% decline in your commodity cost. And I wanted to ask you, where does the 18% essentially come from? Is it assuming that the current spot rates continue? Is there an easy rule of thumb in terms of, okay, if oil prices come down by a certain amount, this is where our materials bill would sort of end up? And then on the second part of the equation, so raw materials is about a $600 million tailwind, which sort of implies that you're planning for the gross pricing to be sort of like down $400 million in 2015. That seems to be the same performance as what you did in '14 despite a potential help from the Chinese tariff. So can you maybe also reconcile how you're thinking about pricing for 2015?"

As you know, it's something that we look at in the aggregate. And I will tell you, clearly, our North America business has an opportunity in that number for increased price/mix over raw materials in 2015. And Rod, I think you're right to point out, and I think Laura said it in her script a bit as well, is that the price/mix equation versus raw materials in some of the international markets is more challenged by a number of reasons -- or for a number of reasons, I would say. And one of those, certainly, is the decrease in raw materials turning up in our raw material indices or our RMI contracts with the OEMs and with fleets that, as you know, work up. And in this case, they worked down as prices go down. Secondly, as we look around the world, what we see are more competitive pressures in some of the sort of emerging market, low-growth countries now outside the U.S., in particular, here, where we see -- or the Asian imports that we see coming in, like in Eastern Europe, that Laura mentioned earlier. And you pair that up with sort of the depreciating foreign currencies they have. As they buy raw materials or dollar-based raw materials, they become more expensive. In those competitive markets, what you see is a more difficult price/mix versus raw materials in those places as well. And then something, Rod, you're familiar with as well, as we look around the world, we have that lag impact of when those decreasing raw material prices actually come into our cost of goods sold. And clearly, we sort of catch up over time, but that has a headwind as we look around the world in those competitive markets as well. But again, I would go back to the fact that over a long period of time, we have a very good track record of managing effectively price/mix versus raw materials. We did it when raw materials were increasing 25%, 30% a year. And clearly, our intent is to manage that as we look at the environment we're in right now. And as you rightly point out, we have a positive opportunity to take advantage of that in North America as well."

There's a lot of moving parts. But if you look at the market data that is available, obviously, it looks like the market was up in the fourth quarter by about 7% in North America. And if you extract the China imports from that, it looks like it may have actually been up even more than that 7%. How do we kind of square that against the 1% decline, especially considering that within North America, you're like 70% HVA? How should we be thinking about your performance here? And it looks like similarly, in Europe, the performance versus the external market data looks a little bit adverse."

So Rod, maybe let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some",655,"Yes. So Rod, maybe let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some 25% increase in Chinese tire volumes coming in ahead of the potential tariffs coming into place. And in Q4, we saw, albeit to a lesser degree, the same thing happen in October and November, with the decrease coming in in December. I think that decrease was almost like 40% as we went. So that tariff impact is still sort of clouding what's really happening in the market. So to your point, it's hard to really see what's going on. I would tell you, in that market, we have stayed true to our North America strategy -- or our company strategy of staying focused on our targeted market segments where we can maximize the value of the Goodyear brand. Even in that tough market, we haven't changed and said, ""Hey, the market's growing. Let's just go sell more tires for volume for volume's sake."" We haven't done that, and you see that in our record fourth quarter, and you see it in our record full year results. So we're managing it very well. Now having said that, Rod, to your point, as good as we feel about managing it, we still have more demand for those HVA tires that we're not fulfilling at the moment. So that's something that we're sort of laser-focused on. And what we're doing to get more tires to our customers, we're getting more out of the existing North America footprint we have from our operational excellence initiatives. We're investing in our North America factories already with the CapEx we have to get more HVA tires out of them. We're also leveraging our global footprint and shipping more tires, those HVA tires in as we have some excess capacity around the world. And finally, albeit a longer-term solution, we're investing in the Americas factory for both HVA in Latin America and in North America. So clearly, we still have more work to do on there as we go. But the positive, we're selling into a growth environment, and we're very, very well positioned to go do that. And as regards Europe, Rod, I would say the European situation, again, was a bit skewed by winter. If we look through third quarter year-to-date, frankly, I was very pleased with both our volume and share position, particularly as we looked at the winter markets. We were ahead in both. We were ahead of the industry in both. And that's sort of gave all the way back in Q4, where, because we had sold in early and there wasn't that much sell-out happening, we saw others actually selling more into the market in the fourth quarter, where we didn't because we already had a shelf space or inventory in those channels, if you will. So we gave back some of the share gains we had in the first 3 quarters of the year. On a full year basis, we were essentially fine. And I think this winter skew, I think another way to think about it, albeit it's a pro forma way, and I'll say someday, it will happen, I hope I'm here to share in it as well, can we have snow in the fourth quarter? We were extremely well positioned in terms of being on the shelves and having podium-winning product to sell out. In a green winter, a yellow winter, as we said, I think we had record warm days in October and November. It didn't happen, and thus, we have the situation that you referred to in Europe right now. So yes, it is complicated and is skewed by the weather, but frankly, that is the reality of what happened."

It's operating well. And I think you're right to point out that some of that positive momentum is being sort of muted by what our 2 very, very significant headwinds.

And in some periods, those margins are going to go higher. In some periods, those margins are likely going to be more challenged.

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and touch on some of the highlights that helped us deliver full year record segment operating income in 2014. I'll also address our outlook for 2015. Laura will follow with a review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
I'm extremely pleased with what our teams in all our regions accomplished over the past year, particularly in light of ongoing global economic volatility, which increased dramatically in the fourth quarter and was amplified by the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
In North America, our team delivered record earnings for the year. With steady execution of our strategy, North America continued to win with consumers. For example, our Assurance All-Season tire, launched in 2014, will reach 1 million sold faster than any previous new product. Likewise, our commercial truck business had a strong year as fleets continued to embrace our outstanding products and business solutions model. 
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business had year-over-year segment operating income growth of $140 million. Our product leadership in the region was confirmed by regular wins in podium finishes and the important magazine tests, in addition to setting the pace in European tire labeling. 
Latin America featured a steady rollout of new high-value added Goodyear products that were a hit with our customers. In Brazil and Mexico, we grew share by delivering a double-digit increase in consumer replacement volume as we've completely revamped our portfolio to take advantage of the MegaTrend shift to HVA products. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, our volume growth in China and India contributed to record earnings in the fourth quarter. Our products won several awards, and we're expanding our distribution to make the most of the opportunities in this growing market. 
And 2014 marked the continuation of our operational excellence initiative, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through the disciplined execution of our strategy, focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand. As you read in our press release, our segment operating income of $1.7 billion was a full year record. It represents an 8% improvement over last year's record performance, a significant accomplishment by any measure but especially gratifying in the midst of challenging global economic conditions in a number of our key markets.  In addition, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, marking the second straight year we have reached that level of cash generation. 
As pleased as I am to report these results, I'll remind you that our strategy is built for the long term, and our destination is to create sustainable value for our associates, for our customers and for our shareholders alike. We believe in the soundness of our strategy and are committed to it even when economic and industry fluctuations demand that we be flexible in our execution. 
A great example of our strategy in action is our North America business. North America delivered $229 million in fourth quarter segment operating income, the best performance of any quarter in its history. It was a fitting way to complete a year in which the business reached $803 million of segment operating income, a full year record. North America is clearly on a path of sustainable performance as it continues to strengthen its earnings and margins as a result of our market-back strategy. 
Three weeks ago, our Annual North America Dealer Conference had the highest attendance in its history. I came away from that meeting more energized than ever as our customers were more enthusiastic, more optimistic and more confident than I've ever seen. Many of them, both consumer and commercial truck tire dealers, had very strong years themselves, reflecting the strength of the Goodyear brand in the marketplace and the value of being an aligned Goodyear dealer. I believe we have the best dealer network in the industry because they do more than just sell tires. They capture the value of everything Goodyear has to offer. 
As always, new products were one of the main sources of interest and enthusiasm at the conference. This year, we introduced a completely new line of tires for the Kelly brand to complement our lineup of Goodyear passenger and light truck tires. The new Kelly tires are our response to our customers' need for a branded tire as a favorable option to Asian imports of private label tires. Our Kelly lineup reinvigorates a well-known brand that our dealers can sell on its value, not price alone. The number of orders we've taken in advance of the Kelly launch this spring has exceeded our expectation, evidence that these tires will be a hit with our customers. 
Now the biggest news from our dealer conference, which you may have heard about already, was the announcement of our plan to start selling Goodyear consumer replacement tires online in North America at goodyear.com. This is how consumers are shopping for many goods and services already, and it's how we believe they will increasingly shop for tires. This new buying option will allow consumers to purchase tires online and have them installed locally at an authorized Goodyear retailer of their choice. 
Beyond just making industry-leading innovative tires, we are focused on making the tire-buying process easier for consumers and creating profitable incremental sales opportunities for our aligned dealers. The program, which will be activated later this year, is a major step for Goodyear and for our network partner dealers. 
As consumer demographics continue to shift and 80 million millennials come into the marketplace, we have to meet their expectations around buying and shopping experiences. By taking the initiative and embracing this digital format to simplify the tire-buying process, we believe we will be the industry leader in this space. It's another Goodyear innovation that goes beyond just tires and a tangible example of our focus on our customers and consumers from the market back rather than from the factory out. 
I'm happy to say that the response from our dealers who are pivotable to the success of this program has been overwhelmingly positive. Our collaboration creates synergies to allow both of our businesses to grow as consumers' buying habits evolve. 
Think about how much our North America business has progressed. We've grown our segment operating income organically from a $300 million loss in 2009 to an $800 million profit in 2014, a $1 billion-plus rebound in 5 years. That's a reflection of a sound strategy and winning execution, and we see continued opportunity ahead. 
Now turning to our Asia-Pacific business. We delivered a record fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across the region. This was despite ongoing economic headwinds in Australia, where we're still feeling the significant effects of the mining industry slowdown. Our state-of-the-art factory in Pulandian, China is delivering as planned, producing industry-leading products and providing cost efficiencies to help increase our brand strength and support our growth in the region. Innovative products remain a pillar of our strategy, and in China, the Goodyear Wrangler was named All-terrain Tire of the Year, and Goodyear Excellence Run On Flat was cited as the Editor's Choice of the Year by a major Chinese automotive magazine. 
Now even with these successes, a variety of industry and economic headwinds over the course of the year and the quarter changed the playing field in 2014 and will continue to have an impact in 2015. Continued economic and political instability across Europe has affected our business in the region, slowing growth in both Western Europe and emerging markets in the region. In short, Europe continues to model along, not yet setting itself on a course to a stable recovery. 
Venezuela continues to be the most challenging market in Latin America. The economic environment remains difficult, and the political situation continues to be on steady, both clearly affected by the recent decline in oil prices. It has become increasingly difficult to forecast sales, pricing and supply in Venezuela with any degree of certainty. Our Brazil original equipment business continues to weaken as auto production has yet to rebound from an extremely weak 2014 and the country's economy remains in or near recession. 
And slower-than-predicted global economic growth and reduced industry sales volumes, particularly outside the U.S., are combining with low raw material costs to create increasingly competitive environments. But the most significant headwind from 2014 that will carry over and continue to have an impact into the year ahead is unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar. The effective translation of our foreign results obscures the progress and growth in our business. At current spot rates, this is a headwind of $180 million in 2015. While foreign currency headwinds will have a negative effect on segment operating income, our underlying business and operations are more robust than ever. Led by our momentum in North America, we remain committed to our target of 2015 segment operating income growth of 10% to 15% above last year's record. 
So while the headwinds I mentioned are significant and will call for flexibility in our operations, we remain committed to our strategy and long-term goals. The environment is more difficult now than when we set our targets in 2013, but we know that the global tire industry is cyclical, and we are prepared to address it. 
In the year ahead, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for a recovery in weaker markets. We expect global volume growth of 1% to 2% in a tough market but are confident that our commitment to pursuing profitable volume will continue to deliver strong results. We believe the best way to reach our long-term objectives is through continued disciplined execution of the key how-tos of our strategy roadmap. Taken together, these elements will help us reduce the inherent stress or friction in our business and allow us to make it easier for customers to sell Goodyear tires and for consumers to buy Goodyear tires. We will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. Investment in our business will be driven from the market back and geared toward providing the high-value products that differentiate Goodyear in the marketplace. 
We've seen the tangible results from our operational excellence initiatives and will continue our journey to become more efficient in our supply chain, reducing cost and building the capabilities necessary to serve our customers better. And as we have done with operational excellence, we are committed to building a global platform of sales and marketing excellence to take full advantage of our brand and our value proposition and drive profitable growth. We are just getting started in this area as we pivot to growth. 
The value of our brand has never been stronger even as economic conditions remain unpredictable. Our focus will stay on winning in the market segments where consumers are willing to pay for the value of our brand, our products, our services and the total Goodyear experience. 
To meet the increasing demand of our products, we expect our new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant for Latin America and North America to come online in 2017. This vital new facility will provide us with more of the high-value tires consumers are demanding in those regions. We also are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint to ensure our ability to deliver the right tires at the right cost. Growth CapEx is required to drive our earnings. However, because of the current slower volume growth in some markets, we are adjusting our CapEx investments in the near term, which Laura will describe later. As always, we will take a thoughtful approach to investment, with an eye on projects that have the highest potential return. 
In summary, I believe we are better prepared than ever to handle the volatility in our business. We're mindful of external conditions that affect our business, but we remain committed to profitable growth. We've executed our strategy and made investments in our business to gain a competitive advantage. To increase our competitive advantage in the cyclical tire business, we are increasing our focus on speed and efficiency to better drive our business and improve customer service. There are opportunities across our business to further streamline our operations and improve our processes to better serve our customers and consumers. We'll discuss these opportunities in more detail as we move through the year. 
Looking back on the full year, I'm extremely proud of our teams and our achievements. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy in place and are delivering record profitability through a volatile period of the economic cycle. We're creating sustainable long-term value and will continue to do so through a balance of growth investments and actions to reduce costs. We are planning for the current volatility to stay with us for an extended period of time, but we remain committed to our long-term goals and are confident in our ability to reach them. Our team has worked through the challenging circumstances before and has delivered strong results. That gives me great confidence that we'll be able to do it again. The tire industry does not grow in a straight line, and we won't be distracted by short-term swings in the market. In light of the progress we've made by executing our strategy, I'm pleased with the state of our business as we look ahead to 2015. The power of our brand and the execution of our strategy strengthens our belief that we will continue to increase our earnings and value for shareholders, not only when the times are good but when they are challenging as well. This is what our strategy was built to do. 
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our fourth quarter results and provide more detail on key items in the quarter. I'll also provide specifics regarding our outlook for 2015 before opening the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I would like to highlight a few key items. In the fourth quarter, both our units sold and our net sales were significantly affected by a year-over-year decline in winter tires sold in EMEA given the unseasonably warm weather in Europe during the quarter. While our winter tires sales through the third quarter were strong, dealer replenishment in the fourth quarter was severely impacted by very weak sellout, which had double-digit declines in some key markets. Our EPS on a diluted basis for the quarter was $7.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, notably the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion, which was originally established in 2002. After significant items, our adjusted EPS was $0.59. More details can be found in the appendix of today's presentation on Slide 26. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks fourth quarter 2013 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2014. Lower volumes in EMEA in the quarter and unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower production levels year-over-year reduced income by $53 million for the quarter. Milder winter weather in Europe versus last year drove reduced price/mix of $81 million, partially offset by lower raw material cost of $30 million. Driven by our operational excellence initiative's strong cost savings across all of our business units for the quarter of $105 million more than offset the $77 million negative impact of inflation. For the full year, we achieved more than $500 million in cost savings, including $55 million from the closure of our Amiens, France facility and the exit of the farm tire business. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $17 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against almost all other currencies. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $2.2 billion, down from $3 billion at the end of 2013. This reduction reflects fully funding the U.S. hourly pension plan in January of 2014, leaving our global unfunded pension obligation at the end of '14 at $714 million. This obligation is primarily related to our international pension plans and is in line with our previous guidance. Our U.S. pension de-risking strategy is working. While our discount rate in the U.S. declined, thereby increasing our liability, our return on assets successfully offset this change. Separately, at the end of 2014, we made an adjustment to our U.S. pension liabilities to reflect future mortality improvements in our actuarial assumptions. The result was an increase of $285 million in our pension liability. Despite this increase and based on current assumptions, we expect no required contribution for our U.S. plans for the foreseeable future. Our total debt balance was up $145 million at year-end, however, on February 3 of 2015, we repaid $200 million on our U.S. term loan. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the full year 2014, we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, with working capital neither a source nor a use of cash in 2014. The walk from net income also reflects the noncash impact of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion in the Provision for Deferred Income Taxes line. As a final comment on this slide, the Other line of $464 million includes various noncash items reflected in net income. The most notable of these items is the $200 million in net Venezuela currency losses in 2014. The strength of our cash generation in the first year of our 3-year plan gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our balanced capital allocation plan. We completed $150 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of that plan, bringing our full year share repurchases to $233 million and 8.9 million shares. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America reported quarterly record segment operating income of $229 million and achieved an operating margin of 10.9%, the third quarter in a row at or above 10%. North America benefited from lower raw material cost and lower conversion cost, primarily driven by reduced pension expense during the quarter. North America's volume was down 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our volume was impacted by tariff prebuy activity and challenges in fully meeting the strong demand for our premium HVA tires. As for the prebuy activity, the U.S. consumer replacement industry continued to face disruption from the anticipation of a tariff on consumer tires imported from China. These imports in the fourth quarter remained very strong through November, until the announcement of the preliminary countervailing duty rates. In December, the level of imports declined by almost half on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the speculative buying during the second half of 2014, channel inventories remain at high levels, which we expect will impact our volumes in the first half of 2015. 
We also continue to see strong demand for our premium tires. Our back orders for these HVA products remain high. As we outlined on our third quarter call, we are leveraging our global footprint for additional supply and are continuing to invest in our North America production facility to enable us to meet the increased demand for our premium branded tires in 2015. 
Our North America commercial truck replacement business also continued to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our industry-leading, fuel-efficient drive tire and fleet business solutions strategy leveraged the robust industry conditions for significant year-over-year growth. To help continue this growth in 2015, we announced our new Fuel Max LHS steer tire at our dealer conference. This new tire will now allow us to offer the #1 fuel-efficient drive-and-steer tire combination in North America. These types of market-back innovative products will continue to allow us to be the leader in premium truck tires in North America. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $30 million in the fourth quarter and a margin of 2.3%. Unseasonably warm temperatures resulted in an 11% decline in the European winter tire industry sell-in in the fourth quarter. This had a direct impact on our volumes and, in turn, our results in EMEA. The overall volume decline impacted EMEA's SOI by approximately $40 million. The combination of warm weather, declining raw material costs, weak sellout and an increased level of imports, mainly in the Eastern countries, drove increased competition in the quarter. Separately, price/mix was negatively impacted by raw material indexed agreements with our OE customers. 
Earlier this year, it finally began to snow across much of Europe. And while we don't anticipate dealers will replenish snow tire inventories during the first quarter, such seasonal weather may benefit sellout and improve inventory levels heading into our normal sell-in season during the third quarter of 2015. 
In commercial truck, we saw the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter after a weak third quarter. Our new products such as the K MAX and Fuel Max, coupled with our service proposition, have enabled us to win new fleet business and gain share in our premium brand. 
In Latin America, our volume increased about 8%. We continue to see strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the continued weakness in the Brazilian OE market. Segment operating income was $20 million for the quarter, $32 million less than the prior year. The decrease in the Latin American results was largely influenced by 3 items: first, $28 million in higher conversion costs due to inflation and lower production volumes; second, $14 million from increased reserves for a value-added tax claim. This item is listed on the fourth quarter adjusted EPS walk on Slide 26. And third, $11 million in foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these 3 items were the benefits of $15 million from price/mix versus raw material costs and $11 million from higher sales volumes during the quarter. 
On the strength of our new product introductions this year in Brazil and improvements in our distribution network, we are gaining share on increased volumes in the consumer replacement business. Given the weaker real, imports are now significantly more expensive locally. This may facilitate additional opportunities to grow in Brazil in 2015 even if the OE environment remains challenging. 
In Asia-Pacific, our fourth quarter volume of 6 million units was 7% higher than a year ago, given our strong double-digit growth in China. Our Asia-Pacific business reported segment operating income of $80 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase over the prior year. The impact of higher volumes and strong cost savings performance, net of general inflation, was offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The SOI margin in the region increased 15.7%, up significantly from last year's 12.5%. While we see slower growth for the region in the short term versus our original expectations, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
On Slide 13, we have provided our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that many of these items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our third quarter call. There are a few notable exceptions, namely an improving price/mix versus raw material picture, offset by incremental headwinds in foreign exchange and a deteriorating environment in Venezuela. Our expectation for price/mix versus raw material cost has improved, largely on the heels of further declines in raw materials and the increased likelihood of a tariff on Chinese tires in the U.S. For the full year, we expect raw materials to be down about 10%, helping drive a 2015 price/mix versus raw material benefit of about $200 million year-over-year. This benefit includes the expectation that OTR will have a relatively neutral impact for 2015 compared to 2014. For a detailed explanation of our raw material benefit calculation, see Appendix Slide 21. 
The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. As Rich noted, we now see a headwind of approximately $180 million from foreign currency translation in 2015. Given the nature of our business and the size of our operation, we have exposure to several key currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which are not only a headwind but a source of uncertainty as well. To assist you in modeling, we have provided a sensitivity analysis for some of our key currencies on Slide 22, in the appendix of today's presentation. 
With respect to Venezuela, based on the protracted challenges and significant economic uncertainty, we are assuming our earnings in Venezuela to be 0 in 2015. For reference, in 2014, Venezuela's operating income was $47 million. For now, our plant continues to operate, and we continue to sell tires as we evaluate all options regarding the future direction of our business there. While we don't anticipate a benefit of any earnings in Venezuela in 2015, we expect to grow our total segment operating income 10% to 15% off of our reported 2014 segment operating income of $1.7 billion. We expect sales volume growth of 1% to 2% for 2015. However, given the prebuy in 2014 in North America related to the potential tariff on imported tires and our plans to increase supply of premium tires in the U.S., we anticipate that the majority of our volume growth in North America will occur in the second half of 2015. That said, we expect the financial impact of the decrease in our tire production volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, to impact Q1 by about $30 million. Overall, we expect unabsorbed overhead to be neutral for the full year versus 2014.
We expect our cost savings initiative to exceed the impact of general inflation by approximately $160 million, with potential upside led by our operational excellence program. We expect savings from the Amiens, France closure and related exit from the European farm tire business to generate approximately $20 million of incremental savings in the first half of 2015, with most of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. Taken together with the $55 million benefit we saw in 2014, this would bring the annualized benefit to approximately $75 million, consistent with our prior outlook. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14. With the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance, we estimate our tax rate to be about 30% of our global pretax operating income for 2015. Our cash tax rate for 2015 will remain much lower at about 15% of global pretax operating income as we do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. for about the next 5 years. We expect global pension expense of $125 million to $175 million and global pension contribution of $50 million to $75 million, all of which will be directed to our international plan. As was the case in 2014, we expect our working capital to be neither a source nor a use of cash in 2015. We are reducing our planned CapEx spend by about $350 million over the next 2 years, in light of lower than previously expected growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $1.1 billion and our 2016 CapEx spend to be about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We will continue to invest where we see strong demand for our products. These include investments in our new manufacturing facility to support the Americas, which will come online in early 2017. 
Our earnings growth targets continue to support our balanced capital allocation plan. With capital expenditures lower by about $350 million over the next 2 years, we expect to be able to reallocate additional cash through our shareholder return program, contingent on our performance and our delivering on our financial targets. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation plan that provides for capital investments for future earnings growth, achieving an investment-grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. So as we look at 2015, the benefits from lower raw materia costs, solid economic trends in North America and continued cost savings performance are expected to be partially offset by a more difficult international environment, including a stronger U.S. dollar globally. While the landscape has changed since we first communicated our 3-year targets back in 2013, our plans continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth in 2015 and 2016.

I will tell you I think your assumption, to start with, is a good one, that product will flow somewhere if it doesn't come to the U.S. in this case. So those tires will end up somewhere. And you may recall, we've talked about it in the past, when we had the 421 action that took place relative to Chinese imports into North America. We kind of had a bit of a perfect storm, particularly in Brazil, where we had a very strong currency. And we saw available tires, if you will, and we saw Chinese imports in Brazil go up dramatically based on their availability and, again, the strength of the currency. So that phenomenon did happen last time. I would suggest to you at this time, it's a bit early to tell. I will say, you heard Laura made a comment in her remarks that we are seeing increased flow of Chinese tires and Asian imports into particularly Eastern Europe. So certainly, I would suggest there's probably some corollary there. I think as we get into '15, we'll have to see how the product flows move. But we did see that already in Q4, and I imagine there is some sort of nexus between those. In terms of -- and by the way, we will watch that very closely around the world. But I will tell you how we build that into our business going forward. That low end of the market, by and large, is not a market where we have played. Our value proposition, as you've heard us talk about, is playing in those targeted market segments where we can capture the value of the Goodyear brand. Certainly, our North America business has been on the forefront of that, but also, that's true in our Asian businesses, in our Latin America businesses, increasingly so, and in Europe as well. So while those tires will come in at the low end, and clearly, by definition, they're going to have an impact, remember, that's not the real part of the market that we tend to play in. So that's how I'd have you think about it."

I was very pleased that now, multiple years in a row, we're getting cost savings ahead of inflation. And that's been really linked back to something that we did -- we started, frankly, when I took the job a while back, our operational excellence initiatives in driving efficiency through our business. And I would say the result is what you're seeing. And remember, that's a variety of programs: through material substitutions to enhance the -- more effective purchasing, let's say; through getting our plants to run more efficiently by getting more production out of those factories at the same or lower cost; and driving very specific programs, driving a One Goodyear Way system throughout our manufacturing footprint around the globe; and driving it through transportation and warehousing to make sure that we're getting the right tires to the right customers at the right time. All those programs, I would say, will continue into 2015, and they'll continue beyond that. And I would say we're really just getting started in terms of driving these programs throughout the world. So you saw in our guidance -- I think Laura mentioned we're forecasting about the same cost outs -- net cost out in 2015 as we did in 2014, about $165 million. That said, you can be pretty sure that our internal goals are to deliver more than that, although we certainly know the global economy is driving a few headwinds as well."

I would say as we think about volumes for 2015, maybe just to start with that, and certainly, Laura can jump in here as well, I would say that one of the elements driving headwinds in volume in 2015 is our European business. And remember, what we have going on there is not only a more difficult economy at this point, but we have sort of the ever-present impact of warm winters. And as we look at 2015, while we see some growth in the summer markets, what's going to happen again with now our third consecutive, in essence, warm winter in Europe, we have a combination of the channels still being relatively full. And maybe if I go back just to shed a little bit more light on it, we planned for a green winter in 2014, so we didn't plan on it being very robust. What we got is -- what we've internally sort of referred to is now a yellow winter because we saw sunshine in October and November. So what happened is we had the channels full and very little sellout going on, and that's continuing so far into 2015. We've got some warm weather there. But what's going to happen is those channels are going to remain full. As we look at winter industry in 2015, we see it actually decreasing again. And on top of a decreasing industry, as dealers now have dealt with 3 years of green winters, psychologically, they're less inclined, if you will, to go long on winter tires in anticipation of snow. So those 2 headwinds say that the Europe market, remember, the winter tires are about 30% of the market there, will put a headwind on volume. And those are -- Europe is a big market for us, so by the numbers, that impacts our volume growth. I would say we look at other markets, particularly Latin America and Asia. You've heard us say we had double-digit growth in volume in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. And that's the first time we've done that in quite some time, so we're very pleased with the volume and share gains we've got there. Our volumes in Asia, let's say, x Australia, are also still growing at a very good pace. And with a more robust economy in North America, with miles driven up, with new car sales up, with sort of a more positive consumer sentiment and with a combination of what is our best product portfolio ever and, on top of that, the selectivity strategy we have at OE now, a couple of 3 years old, getting on those good fitments, those cars are now going to roll into the replacement dealers to get replaced as well. So we see opportunity in North America as well. So from a volume perspective, roll that up, we're sort of on that 1% to 2% volume growth in 2015."

This is really incredibly helpful in understanding better the dynamics here. Actually, I wanted to ask you about -- just a little bit more on that. When I look at your raw materials assumption, it looks like essentially, you're expecting about a 10% decline in overall raw materials cost. But the way it's modeled seems to be like about an 18% decline in your commodity cost. And I wanted to ask you, where does the 18% essentially come from? Is it assuming that the current spot rates continue? Is there an easy rule of thumb in terms of, okay, if oil prices come down by a certain amount, this is where our materials bill would sort of end up? And then on the second part of the equation, so raw materials is about a $600 million tailwind, which sort of implies that you're planning for the gross pricing to be sort of like down $400 million in 2015. That seems to be the same performance as what you did in '14 despite a potential help from the Chinese tariff. So can you maybe also reconcile how you're thinking about pricing for 2015?"

And one of the new items that we made very transparent out there is that about 25% of our raw material costs aren't affected by commodity prices, right? Those are things like R&D and conversion cost and the profit for the vendor as we go. And that helps to really walk us down to that 10%. Now the 18% is really our view. There's no rule of thumb on that 18%. It's based on our planning assumptions on the mix of the products that we will buy. And it is based, though, on current spot rates as we go."

As you know, it's something that we look at in the aggregate. And I will tell you, clearly, our North America business has an opportunity in that number for increased price/mix over raw materials in 2015. And Rod, I think you're right to point out, and I think Laura said it in her script a bit as well, is that the price/mix equation versus raw materials in some of the international markets is more challenged by a number of reasons -- or for a number of reasons, I would say. And one of those, certainly, is the decrease in raw materials turning up in our raw material indices or our RMI contracts with the OEMs and with fleets that, as you know, work up. And in this case, they worked down as prices go down. Secondly, as we look around the world, what we see are more competitive pressures in some of the sort of emerging market, low-growth countries now outside the U.S., in particular, here, where we see -- or the Asian imports that we see coming in, like in Eastern Europe, that Laura mentioned earlier. And you pair that up with sort of the depreciating foreign currencies they have. As they buy raw materials or dollar-based raw materials, they become more expensive. In those competitive markets, what you see is a more difficult price/mix versus raw materials in those places as well. And then something, Rod, you're familiar with as well, as we look around the world, we have that lag impact of when those decreasing raw material prices actually come into our cost of goods sold. And clearly, we sort of catch up over time, but that has a headwind as we look around the world in those competitive markets as well. But again, I would go back to the fact that over a long period of time, we have a very good track record of managing effectively price/mix versus raw materials. We did it when raw materials were increasing 25%, 30% a year. And clearly, our intent is to manage that as we look at the environment we're in right now. And as you rightly point out, we have a positive opportunity to take advantage of that in North America as well."

And if you extract the China imports from that, it looks like it may have actually been up even more than that 7%. How do we kind of square that against the 1% decline, especially considering that within North America, you're like 70% HVA? How should we be thinking about your performance here?

So Rod, maybe let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some",655,"Yes. So Rod, maybe let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some 25% increase in Chinese tire volumes coming in ahead of the potential tariffs coming into place. And in Q4, we saw, albeit to a lesser degree, the same thing happen in October and November, with the decrease coming in in December. I think that decrease was almost like 40% as we went. So that tariff impact is still sort of clouding what's really happening in the market. So to your point, it's hard to really see what's going on. I would tell you, in that market, we have stayed true to our North America strategy -- or our company strategy of staying focused on our targeted market segments where we can maximize the value of the Goodyear brand. Even in that tough market, we haven't changed and said, ""Hey, the market's growing. Let's just go sell more tires for volume for volume's sake."" We haven't done that, and you see that in our record fourth quarter, and you see it in our record full year results. So we're managing it very well. Now having said that, Rod, to your point, as good as we feel about managing it, we still have more demand for those HVA tires that we're not fulfilling at the moment. So that's something that we're sort of laser-focused on. And what we're doing to get more tires to our customers, we're getting more out of the existing North America footprint we have from our operational excellence initiatives. We're investing in our North America factories already with the CapEx we have to get more HVA tires out of them. We're also leveraging our global footprint and shipping more tires, those HVA tires in as we have some excess capacity around the world. And finally, albeit a longer-term solution, we're investing in the Americas factory for both HVA in Latin America and in North America. So clearly, we still have more work to do on there as we go. But the positive, we're selling into a growth environment, and we're very, very well positioned to go do that. And as regards Europe, Rod, I would say the European situation, again, was a bit skewed by winter. If we look through third quarter year-to-date, frankly, I was very pleased with both our volume and share position, particularly as we looked at the winter markets. We were ahead in both. We were ahead of the industry in both. And that's sort of gave all the way back in Q4, where, because we had sold in early and there wasn't that much sell-out happening, we saw others actually selling more into the market in the fourth quarter, where we didn't because we already had a shelf space or inventory in those channels, if you will. So we gave back some of the share gains we had in the first 3 quarters of the year. On a full year basis, we were essentially fine. And I think this winter skew, I think another way to think about it, albeit it's a pro forma way, and I'll say someday, it will happen, I hope I'm here to share in it as well, can we have snow in the fourth quarter? We were extremely well positioned in terms of being on the shelves and having podium-winning product to sell out. In a green winter, a yellow winter, as we said, I think we had record warm days in October and November. It didn't happen, and thus, we have the situation that you referred to in Europe right now. So yes, it is complicated and is skewed by the weather, but frankly, that is the reality of what happened."

So I feel good about talking about this. I think as we look at it, we haven't thought about the business in terms of how high they can go. You can look around the tire industry globally and look at sort of the competitive landscape and see where margins are, and that's certainly a reasonable thing to do. I think our focus really is really consistent with what we talk about internally, and that's really creating value, sustainable value over the long term and understanding the tire industry as a very cyclical industry and that our job is to grow this business, grow it profitably, win with our consumers in the marketplace and really help our partner dealers, our network dealers grow their business. And in some periods, those margins are going to go higher. In some periods, those margins are likely going to be more challenged. But over the long term, our goal is to drive higher highs and higher lows in our North America business.

275789,283618761,763915,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2015",2015-02-17,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone.

I'll also address our outlook fo",2323,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and touch on some of the highlights that helped us deliver full year record segment operating income in 2014. I'll also address our outlook for 2015. Laura will follow with a review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
I'm extremely pleased with what our teams in all our regions accomplished over the past year, particularly in light of ongoing global economic volatility, which increased dramatically in the fourth quarter and was amplified by the strengthening U.S. dollar.
In North America, our team delivered record earnings for the year. With steady execution of our strategy, North America continued to win with consumers. For example, our Assurance All-Season tire, launched in 2014, will reach 1 million sold faster than any previous new product. Likewise, our commercial truck business had a strong year as fleets continued to embrace our outstanding products and business solutions model. 
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business had year-over-year segment operating income growth of $140 million. Our product leadership in the region was confirmed by regular wins and podium finishes and the important magazine tests, in addition to setting the pace in European tire labeling.
Latin America featured a steady rollout of new high-value-added Goodyear products that were a hit with our customers. In Brazil and Mexico, we grew share by delivering a double-digit increase in consumer replacement volume as we've completely revamped our portfolio to take advantage of the MegaTrend shift to HVA products. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, our volume growth in China and India contributed to record earnings in the fourth quarter. Our products won several awards, and we're expanding our distribution to make the most of the opportunities in this growing market. 
And 2014 marked the continuation of our operational excellence initiative, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through the disciplined execution of our strategy, focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand. As you read in our press release, our segment operating income of $1.7 billion was a full year record. It represents an 8% improvement over last year's record performance, a significant accomplishment by any measure but especially gratifying in the midst of challenging global economic conditions in a number of our key markets.  In addition, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, marking the second straight year we have reached that level of cash generation. 
As pleased as I am to report these results, I'll remind you that our strategy is built for the long term, and our destination is to create sustainable value for our associates, for our customers and for our shareholders alike. We believe in the soundness of our strategy and are committed to it even when economic and industry fluctuations demand that we be flexible in our execution. 
A great example of our strategy in action is our North America business. North America delivered $229 million in fourth quarter segment operating income, the best performance of any quarter in its history. It was a fitting way to complete a year in which the business reached $803 million of segment operating income, a full year record. North America is clearly on a path of sustainable performance as it continues to strengthen its earnings and margins as a result of our market-back strategy. 
Three weeks ago, our Annual North America Dealer Conference had the highest attendance in its history. I came away from that meeting more energized than ever as our customers were more enthusiastic, more optimistic and more confident than I've ever seen. Many of them, both consumer and commercial truck tire dealers, had very strong years themselves, reflecting the strength of the Goodyear brand in the marketplace and the value of being an aligned Goodyear dealer. I believe we have the best dealer network in the industry because they do more than just sell tires. They capture the value of everything Goodyear has to offer. 
As always, new products were one of the main sources of interest and enthusiasm at the conference. This year, we introduced a completely new line of tires for the Kelly brand to complement our lineup of Goodyear passenger and light truck tires. The new Kelly tires are our response to our customers' need for a branded tire as a favorable option to Asian imports or private label tires. Our Kelly lineup reinvigorates a well-known brand that our dealers can sell on its value, not price alone. The number of orders we've taken in advance of the Kelly launch this spring has exceeded our expectation, evidence that these tires will be a hit with our customers. 
Now the biggest news from our dealer conference, which you may have heard about already, was the announcement of our plan to start selling Goodyear consumer replacement tires online in North America at goodyear.com. This is how consumers are shopping for many goods and services already, and it's how we believe they will increasingly shop for tires. This new buying option will allow consumers to purchase tires online and have them installed locally at an authorized Goodyear retailer of their choice. 
Beyond just making industry-leading innovative tires, we are focused on making the tire-buying process easier for consumers and creating profitable incremental sales opportunities for our aligned dealers. The program, which will be activated later this year, is a major step for Goodyear and for our network partner dealers.
As consumer demographics continue to shift and 80 million millennials come into the marketplace, we have to meet their expectations around buying and shopping experiences. By taking the initiative and embracing this digital format to simplify the tire-buying process, we believe we will be the industry leader in this space. It's another Goodyear innovation that goes beyond just tires and a tangible example of our focus on our customers and consumers from the market back rather than from the factory out.
I'm happy to say that the response from our dealers, who are pivotable to the success of this program, has been overwhelmingly positive. Our collaboration creates synergies to allow both of our businesses to grow as consumers' buying habits evolve. 
Think about how much our North America business has progressed. We've grown our segment operating income organically from a $300 million loss in 2009 to an $800 million profit in 2014, a $1 billion-plus rebound in 5 years. That's a reflection of a sound strategy and winning execution, and we see continued opportunity ahead. 
Now turning to our Asia-Pacific business. We delivered a record fourth quarter as we continued to take advantage of growth opportunities across the region. This was despite ongoing economic headwinds in Australia, where we're still feeling the significant effects of the mining industry slowdown. Our state-of-the-art factory in Pulandian, China, is delivering as planned, producing industry-leading products and providing cost efficiencies to help increase our brand strength and support our growth in the region. Innovative products remain a pillar of our strategy, and in China, the Goodyear Wrangler was named All-terrain Tire of the Year, and Goodyear Excellence Run On Flat was cited as the Editor's Choice of the Year by a major Chinese automotive magazine. 
Now even with these successes, a variety of industry and economic headwinds over the course of the year and the quarter changed the playing field in 2014 and will continue to have an impact in 2015. Continued economic and political instability across Europe has affected our business in the region, slowing growth in both Western Europe and emerging markets in the region. In short, Europe continues to model [ph] along, not yet setting itself on a course to a stable recovery. 
Venezuela continues to be the most challenging market in Latin America. The economic environment remains difficult, and the political situation continues to be unsteady, both clearly affected by the recent decline in oil prices. It has become increasingly difficult to forecast sales, pricing and supply in Venezuela with any degree of certainty. Our Brazil original equipment business continues to weaken as auto production has yet to rebound from an extremely weak 2014, and the country's economy remains in or near recession. 
And slower-than-predicted global economic growth and reduced industry sales volumes, particularly outside the U.S., are combining with low raw material costs to create increasingly competitive environments. But the most significant headwind from 2014 that will carry over and continue to have an impact into the year ahead is unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar. The effective translation of our foreign results obscures the progress and growth in our business. At current spot rates, this is a headwind of $180 million in 2015. While foreign currency headwinds will have a negative effect on segment operating income, our underlying business and operations are more robust than ever. Led by our momentum in North America, we remain committed to our target of 2015 segment operating income growth of 10% to 15% above last year's record. 
So while the headwinds I mentioned are significant and will call for flexibility in our operations, we remain committed to our strategy and long-term goals. The environment is more difficult now than when we set our targets in 2013, but we know that the global tire industry is cyclical, and we are prepared to address it. 
In the year ahead, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for a recovery in weaker markets. We expect global volume growth of 1% to 2% in a tough market but are confident that our commitment to pursuing profitable volume will continue to deliver strong results. We believe the best way to reach our long-term objectives is through continued disciplined execution of the key how-tos of our strategy roadmap. Taken together, these elements will help us reduce the inherent stress or friction in our business and allow us to make it easier for customers to sell Goodyear tires and for consumers to buy Goodyear tires. We will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. Investment in our business will be driven from the market back and geared toward providing the high-value products that differentiate Goodyear in the marketplace. 
We've seen the tangible results from our operational excellence initiatives and will continue our journey to become more efficient in our supply chain, reducing cost and building the capabilities necessary to serve our customers better. And as we have done with operational excellence, we are committed to building a global platform of sales and marketing excellence to take full advantage of our brand and our value proposition and drive profitable growth. We are just getting started in this area as we pivot to growth. 
The value of our brand has never been stronger, even as economic conditions remain unpredictable. Our focus will stay on winning in the market segments where consumers are willing to pay for the value of our brand, our products, our services and the total Goodyear experience. 
To meet the increasing demand of our products, we expect our new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant for Latin America and North America to come online in 2017. This vital new facility will provide us with more of the high-value tires consumers are demanding in those regions. We also are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint to ensure our ability to deliver the right tires at the right cost. Growth CapEx is required to drive our earnings. However, because of the current slower volume growth in some markets, we are adjusting our CapEx investments in the near term, which Laura will describe later. As always, we will take a thoughtful approach to investment, with an eye on projects that have the highest potential return. 
In summary, I believe we are better prepared than ever to handle the volatility in our business. We're mindful of external conditions that affect our business, but we remain committed to profitable growth. We've executed our strategy and made investments in our business to gain a competitive advantage. To increase our competitive advantage in the cyclical tire business, we are increasing our focus on speed and efficiency to better drive our business and improve customer service. There are opportunities across our business to further streamline our operations and improve our processes to better serve our customers and consumers. We'll discuss these opportunities in more detail as we move through the year. 
Looking back on the full year, I'm extremely proud of our teams and our achievements. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy in place and are delivering record profitability through a volatile period of the economic cycle. We're creating sustainable long-term value and will continue to do so through a balance of growth investments and actions to reduce costs. We are planning for the current volatility to stay with us for an extended period of time, but we remain committed to our long-term goals and are confident in our ability to reach them. Our team has worked through the challenging circumstances before and has delivered strong results. That gives me great confidence that we'll be able to do it again. The tire industry does not grow in a straight line, and we won't be distracted by short-term swings in the market. In light of the progress we've made by executing our strategy, I'm pleased with the state of our business as we look ahead to 2015. The power of our brand and the execution of our strategy strengthens our belief that we will continue to increase our earnings and value for shareholders, not only when the times are good but when they are challenging as well. This is what our strategy was built to do.
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our fourth quarter results and provide more detail on key items in the quarter. I'll also provide specifics regarding our outlook for 2015 before opening the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I would like to highlight a few key items. In the fourth quarter, both our units sold and our net sales were significantly affected by a year-over-year decline in winter tires sold in EMEA given the unseasonably warm weather in Europe during the quarter. While our winter tires sales through the third quarter were strong, dealer replenishment in the fourth quarter was severely impacted by very weak sellout, which had double-digit declines in some key markets. Our EPS on a diluted basis for the quarter was $7.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, notably the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion, which was originally established in 2002. After significant items, our adjusted EPS was $0.59. More details can be found in the appendix of today's presentation on Slide 26. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks fourth quarter 2013 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2014. Lower volumes in EMEA in the quarter and unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower production levels year-over-year reduced income by $53 million for the quarter. Milder winter weather in Europe versus last year drove reduced price/mix of $81 million, partially offset by lower raw material cost of $30 million. Driven by our operational excellence initiatives, strong cost savings across all of our business units for the quarter of $105 million more than offset the $77 million negative impact of inflation. For the full year, we achieved more than $500 million in cost savings, including $55 million from the closure of our Amiens, France, facility and the exit of the farm tire business. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $17 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against almost all other currencies. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $2.2 billion, down from $3 billion at the end of 2013. This reduction reflects fully funding the U.S. hourly pension plan in January of 2014, leaving our global unfunded pension obligation at the end of '14 at $714 million. This obligation is primarily related to our international pension plans and is in line with our previous guidance. Our U.S. pension de-risking strategy is working. While our discount rate in the U.S. declined, thereby increasing our liability, our return on assets successfully offset this change. Separately, at the end of 2014, we made an adjustment to our U.S. pension liabilities to reflect future mortality improvements in our actuarial assumptions. The result was an increase of $285 million in our pension liability. Despite this increase and based on current assumptions, we expect no required contributions for our U.S. plans for the foreseeable future. Our total debt balance was up $145 million at year-end. However, on February 3 of 2015, we repaid $200 million on our U.S. term loan. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the full year 2014, we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, with working capital neither a source nor a use of cash in 2014. The walk from net income also reflects the noncash impact of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion in the Provision for Deferred Income Taxes line. As a final comment on this slide, the Other line of $464 million includes various noncash items reflected in net income. The most notable of these items is the $200 million in net Venezuela currency losses in 2014. The strength of our cash generation in the first year of our 3-year plan gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our balanced capital allocation plan. We completed $150 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of that plan, bringing our full year share repurchases to $233 million and 8.9 million shares. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America reported quarterly record segment operating income of $229 million and achieved an operating margin of 10.9%, the third quarter in a row at or above 10%. North America benefited from lower raw material cost and lower conversion cost, primarily driven by reduced pension expense during the quarter. North America's volume was down 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our volume was impacted by tariff prebuy activity and challenges in fully meeting the strong demand for our premium HVA tires. As for the prebuy activity, the U.S. consumer replacement industry continued to face disruption from the anticipation of a tariff on consumer tires imported from China. These imports in the fourth quarter remained very strong through November, until the announcement of the preliminary countervailing duty rates. In December, the level of imports declined by almost half on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the speculative buying during the second half of 2014, channel inventories remain at high levels, which we expect will impact our volumes in the first half of 2015. 
We also continue to see strong demand for our premium tires. Our back orders for these HVA products remain high. As we outlined on our third quarter call, we are leveraging our global footprint for additional supply and are continuing to invest in our North America production facilities to enable us to meet the increased demand for our premium branded tires in 2015.
Our North America commercial truck replacement business also continued to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our industry-leading, fuel-efficient drive tire and fleet business solutions strategy leveraged the robust industry conditions for significant year-over-year growth. To help continue this growth in 2015, we announced our new Fuel Max LHS steer tire at our dealer conference. This new tire will now allow us to offer the #1 fuel-efficient drive-and-steer tire combination in North America. These types of market-back innovative products will continue to allow us to be the leader in premium truck tires in North America. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $30 million in the fourth quarter and a margin of 2.3%. Unseasonably warm temperatures resulted in an 11% decline in the European winter tire industry sell-in in the fourth quarter. This had a direct impact on our volumes and, in turn, our results in EMEA. The overall volume decline impacted EMEA's SOI by approximately $40 million. The combination of warm weather, declining raw material costs, weak sellout and an increased level of imports, mainly in the Eastern countries, drove increased competition in the quarter. Separately, price/mix was negatively impacted by raw material index agreements with our OE customers. 
Earlier this year, it finally began to snow across much of Europe. And while we don't anticipate dealers will replenish snow tire inventories during the first quarter, such seasonal weather may benefit sellout and improve inventory levels heading into our normal sell-in season during the third quarter of 2015. 
In commercial truck, we saw the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter after a weak third quarter. Our new products such as the K MAX and Fuel Max, coupled with our service proposition, have enabled us to win new fleet business and gain share in our premium brands. 
In Latin America, our volume increased about 8%. We continue to see strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the continued weakness in the Brazilian OE market. Segment operating income was $20 million for the quarter, $32 million less than the prior year. The decrease in the Latin American results was largely influenced by 3 items: first, $28 million in higher conversion costs due to inflation and lower production volumes; second, $14 million from increased reserves for a value-added tax claim. This item is listed on the fourth quarter adjusted EPS walk on Slide 26. And third, $11 million in foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these 3 items were the benefits of $15 million from price/mix versus raw material costs and $11 million from higher sales volumes during the quarter.
On the strength of our new product introductions this year in Brazil and improvements in our distribution network, we are gaining share on increased volumes in the consumer replacement business. Given the weaker real, imports are now significantly more expensive locally. This may facilitate additional opportunities to grow in Brazil in 2015 even if the OE environment remains challenging.
In Asia-Pacific, our fourth quarter volume of 6 million units was 7% higher than a year ago, given our strong double-digit growth in China. Our Asia-Pacific business reported segment operating income of $80 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase over the prior year. The impact of higher volumes and strong cost savings performance, net of general inflation, was offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The SOI margin in the region increased to 15.7%, up significantly from last year's 12.5%. While we see slower growth for the region in the short term versus our original expectations, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
On Slide 13, we have provided our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that many of these items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our third quarter call. There are a few notable exceptions, namely an improving price/mix versus raw material picture, offset by incremental headwinds in foreign exchange and a deteriorating environment in Venezuela. Our expectation for price/mix versus raw material cost has improved, largely on the heels of further declines in raw materials and the increased likelihood of a tariff on Chinese tires in the U.S. For the full year, we expect raw materials to be down about 10%, helping drive a 2015 price/mix versus raw material benefit of about $200 million year-over-year. This benefit includes the expectation that OTR will have a relatively neutral impact for 2015 compared to 2014. For a detailed explanation of our raw material benefit calculation, see Appendix Slide 21.
The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. As Rich noted, we now see a headwind of approximately $180 million from foreign currency translation in 2015. Given the nature of our business and the size of our operations, we have exposure to several key currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which are not only a headwind but a source of uncertainty as well. To assist you in modeling, we have provided a sensitivity analysis for some of our key currencies on Slide 22, in the appendix of today's presentation.
With respect to Venezuela, based on the protracted challenges and significant economic uncertainty, we are assuming our earnings in Venezuela to be 0 in 2015. For reference, in 2014, Venezuela's operating income was $47 million. For now, our plant continues to operate, and we continue to sell tires as we evaluate all options regarding the future direction of our business there. While we don't anticipate a benefit of any earnings in Venezuela in 2015, we expect to grow our total segment operating income 10% to 15% off of our reported 2014 segment operating income of $1.7 billion. We expect sales volume growth of 1% to 2% for 2015. However, given the prebuy in 2014 in North America related to the potential tariffs on imported tires and our plans to increase supply of premium tires in the U.S., we anticipate that the majority of our volume growth in North America will occur in the second half of 2015. That said, we expect the financial impact of the decrease in our tire production volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, to impact Q1 by about $30 million. Overall, we expect unabsorbed overhead to be neutral for the full year versus 2014.
We expect our cost savings initiative to exceed the impact of general inflation by approximately $160 million, with potential upside led by our operational excellence program. We expect savings from the Amiens, France, closure and related exit from the European farm tire business to generate approximately $20 million of incremental savings in the first half of 2015, with most of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. Taken together with the $55 million benefit we saw in 2014, this would bring the annualized benefit to approximately $75 million, consistent with our prior outlook. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14. With the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance, we estimate our tax rate to be about 30% of our global pretax operating income for 2015. Our cash tax rate for 2015 will remain much lower at about 15% of global pretax operating income as we do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. for about the next 5 years. We expect global pension expense of $125 million to $175 million and global pension contributions of $50 million to $75 million, all of which will be directed to our international plans. As was the case in 2014, we expect our working capital to be neither a source nor a use of cash in 2015. We are reducing our planned CapEx spend by about $350 million over the next 2 years, in light of lower than previously expected growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $1.1 billion and our 2016 CapEx spend to be about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We will continue to invest where we see strong demand for our products. These include investments in our new manufacturing facility to support the Americas, which will come online in early 2017. 
Our earnings growth targets continue to support our balanced capital allocation plan. With capital expenditures lower by about $350 million over the next 2 years, we expect to be able to reallocate additional cash to our shareholder return program, contingent on our performance and our delivering on our financial targets. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation plan that provides for capital investments for future earnings growth, achieving an investment-grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. So as we look at 2015, the benefits from lower raw material costs, solid economic trends in North America and continued cost savings performance are expected to be partially offset by a more difficult international environment, including a stronger U.S. dollar globally. While the landscape has changed since we first communicated our 3-year targets back in 2013, our plans continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth in 2015 and 2016.

I will tell you I think your assumption, to start with, is a good one, that product will flow somewhere if it doesn't come to the U.S. in this case. So those tires will end up somewhere. And you may recall, we've talked about it in the past, when we had the 421 action that took place relative to Chinese imports into North America. We kind of had a bit of a perfect storm, particularly in Brazil, where we had a very strong currency. And we saw available tires, if you will, and we saw Chinese imports in Brazil go up dramatically based on their availability and, again, the strength of the currency. So that phenomena did happen last time. I would suggest to you at this time, it's a bit early to tell. I will say, you heard Laura make a comment in her remarks that we are seeing increased flow of Chinese tires and Asian imports into particularly Eastern Europe. So certainly, I would suggest there's probably some corollary there. I think as we get into '15, we'll have to see how the product flows move. But we did see that already in Q4, and I imagine there is some sort of nexus between those. In terms of -- and by the way, we will watch that very closely around the world. But I will tell you how we build that into our business going forward. That low end of the market, by and large, is not a market where we have played. Our value proposition, as you've heard us talk about, is playing in those targeted market segments where we can capture the value of the Goodyear brand. Certainly, our North America business has been on the forefront of that, but also, that's true in our Asian businesses, in our Latin America businesses, increasingly so, and in Europe as well. So while those tires will come in at the low end, and clearly, by definition, they're going to have an impact, remember, that's not the real part of the market that we tend to play in. So that's how I'd have you think about it."

I was very pleased that now, multiple years in a row, we're getting cost savings ahead of inflation. And that's been really linked back to something that we did -- we started, frankly, when I took the job a while back, our operational excellence initiatives in driving efficiency through our business. And I would say the result is what you're seeing. And remember, that's a variety of programs, through material substitutions; to enhanced -- more effective purchasing, let's say; through getting our plants to run more efficiently by getting more production out of those factories at the same or lower cost; and driving very specific programs, driving a One Goodyear Way system throughout our manufacturing footprint around the globe; and driving it through transportation and warehousing to make sure that we're getting the right tires to the right customers at the right time. All those programs, I would say, will continue into 2015, and they'll continue beyond that. And I would say we're really just getting started in terms of driving these programs throughout the world. So you saw in our guidance -- I think Laura mentioned we're forecasting about the same cost outs -- net cost out in 2015 as we did in 2014, about $165 million. That said, you can be pretty sure that our internal goals are to deliver more than that, although we certainly know the global economy is driving a few headwinds as well."

I would say as we think about volumes for 2015, maybe just to start with that, and certainly, Laura can jump in here as well, I would say that one of the elements driving headwinds in volume in 2015 is our European business. And remember, what we have going on there is not only a more difficult economy at this point, but we have sort of the ever-present impact of warm winters. And as we look at 2015, while we see some growth in the summer markets, what's going to happen again with now our third consecutive, in essence, warm winter in Europe, we have a combination of the channels still being relatively full. And maybe if I go back, just to shed a little bit more light on it, we planned for a green winter in 2014, so we didn't plan on it being very robust. What we got is -- what we've internally sort of referred to as now a yellow winter, because we saw sunshine in October and November. So what happened is we had the channels full and very little sellout going on, and that's continuing so far into 2015. We've got some warm weather there. But what's going to happen is those channels are going to remain full. As we look at winter industry in 2015, we see it actually decreasing again. And on top of a decreasing industry, as dealers now have dealt with 3 years of green winters, psychologically, they're less inclined, if you will, to go long on winter tires in anticipation of snow. So those 2 headwinds say that the Europe market, remember, the winter tires are about 30% of the market there, will put a headwind on volume. And those are -- Europe is a big market for us, so by the numbers, that impacts our volume growth. I would say we look at other markets, particularly Latin America and Asia. You've heard us say we had double-digit growth in volume in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. And that's the first time we've done that in quite some time, so we're very pleased with the volume and share gains we've got there. Our volumes in Asia, let's say, x Australia, are also still growing at a very good pace. And with a more robust economy in North America, with miles driven up, with new car sales up, with sort of a more positive consumer sentiment and with a combination of what is our best product portfolio ever and, on top of that, the selectivity strategy we had at OE now, a couple of 3 years old, getting on those good fitments, those cars are now going to roll into the replacement dealers to get replaced as well. So we see opportunity in North America as well. So from a volume perspective, roll that up, we're sort of on that 1% to 2% volume growth for 2015."

This is really incredibly helpful in understanding better the dynamics here. Actually, I wanted to ask you about -- just a little bit more on that. When I look at your raw materials assumption, it looks like, essentially, you're expecting about a 10% decline in overall raw materials cost. But the way it's modeled seems to be like about an 18% decline in your commodity cost. And I wanted to ask you, where does the 18% essentially come from? Is it assuming that the current spot rates continue? Is there an easy rule of thumb in terms of, okay, if oil price come down by a certain amount, this is where our materials bill would sort of end up? And then on the second part of the equation, so raw materials is about a $600 million tailwind, which sort of implies that you're planning for the gross pricing to be sort of like down $400 million in 2015. That seems to be the same performance as what you did in '14 despite a potential help from the Chinese tariff. So can you maybe also reconcile how you're thinking about pricing for 2015?"

With Page 20 and 21 in the appendix, we really tried to give a lot more transparency about how commodity prices impact our income statement and cash flows as we go. And one of those new items that we made very transparent out there is that about 25% of our raw material costs aren't affected by commodity prices, right? Those are things like R&D and conversion cost and the profit for the vendor as we go. And that helps to really walk us down to that 10%. Now the 18% is really our view.

As you know, it's something that we look at in the aggregate. And I will tell you, clearly, our North America business has an opportunity in that number for increased price/mix over raw materials in 2015. And Rod, I think you're right to point out, and I think Laura said it in her script a bit as well, is that the price/mix equation versus raw materials in some of the international markets is more challenged by a number of reasons -- or for a number of reasons, I would say. And one of those, certainly, is the decrease in raw materials turning up in our raw material indices or our RMI contracts with the OEMs and with fleets that, as you know, work up. And in this case, they work down as prices go down. Secondly, as we look around the world, what we see are more competitive pressures in some of the sort of emerging market, low-growth countries now outside the U.S., in particular, here, where we see -- or [ph] the Asian imports that we see coming in, like in Eastern Europe, that Laura mentioned earlier. And you pair that up with sort of the depreciating foreign currencies they have. As they buy raw materials or dollar-based raw materials, they become more expensive. In those competitive markets, what you see is a more difficult price/mix versus raw materials in those places as well. And then something, Rod, you're familiar with as well, as we look around the world, we have that lag impact of when those decreasing raw material prices actually come into our cost of goods sold. And clearly, we sort of catch up over time, but that has a headwind as we look around the world in those competitive markets as well. But again, I would go back to the fact that over a long period of time, we have a very good track record of managing effectively price/mix versus raw materials. We did it when raw materials were increasing 25%, 30% a year. And clearly, our intent is to manage that as we look at the environment we're in right now. And as you rightly point out, we have a positive opportunity to take advantage of that in North America as well."

And if you extract the China imports from that, it looks like it may have actually been up even more than that 7%. How do we kind of square that against the 1% decline, especially considering that within North America, you're like 70% HVA? How should we be thinking about your performance here? And it looks like similarly, in Europe, your -- the performance versus the external market data looks a little bit adverse."

So Rod, maybe let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some",662,"Yes. So Rod, maybe let's take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014, what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some 25% increase in Chinese tire volumes coming in ahead of the potential tariffs coming into place. And in Q4, we saw, albeit to a lesser degree, the same thing happen in October and November, with a decrease coming in, in December. I think that decrease was almost like 40% as we went. So that tariff impact is still sort of clouding what's really happening in the market. So to your point, it's hard to really see what's going on. I would tell you, in that market, we have stayed true to our North America strategy -- or our company strategy of staying focused on our targeted market segments where we can maximize the value of the Goodyear brand. Even in that tough market, we haven't changed and said, ""Hey, the market's growing. Let's just go sell more tires for volume for volume's sake."" We haven't done that, and you see that in a record fourth quarter, and you see it in a record full year results. So we're managing it very well. Now having said that, Rod, to your point, as good as we feel about managing it, we still have more demand for those HVA tires that we're not fulfilling at the moment. So that's something that we're sort of laser-focused on. And what we're doing to get more tires to our customers, we're getting more out of the existing North America footprint we have from our operational excellence initiatives. We're investing in our North America factories already with the CapEx we have to get more HVA tires out of them. We're also leveraging our global footprint and shipping more tires, those HVA tires in as we have some excess capacity around the world. And finally, albeit a longer-term solution, we're investing in the Americas factory for both HVA in Latin America and in North America. So clearly, we still have more work to do on there as we go. But the positive, we're selling into a growth environment, and we're very, very well positioned to go do that. And as regard to Europe, Rod, I would say the European situation, again, was a bit skewed by winter. If we look through third quarter year-to-date, frankly, I was very pleased with both our volume and share position, particularly as we looked at the winter markets. We were ahead in both. We were ahead of the industry in both. And that sort of gave all the way back in Q4, where, because we had sold in early and there wasn't that much sell-out happening, we saw others actually selling more into the market in the fourth quarter, where we didn't because we already had a shelf space or inventory in those channels, if you will. So we gave back some of the share gains we had in the first 3 quarters of the year. On a full year basis, we were essentially fine. And I think this winter skew, I think another way to think about it, albeit it's a pro forma way, and I'll say someday, it will happen. I hope I'm here to share in it as well. Had we had snow in the fourth quarter, we were extremely well positioned in terms of being on the shelves and having podium-winning product to sell out. In a green winter, a yellow winter, as we said -- 2 of the -- I think we had record warm days in October and November. It didn't happen, and thus, we have the situation that you referred to in Europe right now. So yes, it is complicated, and it is skewed by the weather, but frankly, that is the reality of what happened."

And we've got a very good core business that's operating well. And I think you're right to point out that some of that positive momentum is being sort of muted by what are 2 very, very significant headwinds. And of course, foreign currency is something we're going to continue to watch. That's at current spot rates, but we don't know where those will go. And obviously, in Venezuela, we continue to monitor that, literally, on a daily basis to determine what are our next steps as we move ahead in Venezuela.

And some periods, those margins are going to go higher, and some periods, those margins are likely going to be more challenged.

This morning, I will review a few of our highlights, including our first quarter results, our record performance in North America and  a few significant announcements we made recently. More will follow with financial review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
Our first quarter performance delivered record segment  operating income of $391 million with an operating margin of 10% despite the significant foreign-exchange headwinds we encountered during the upper. Segment operating income in the quarter grew 5%, which when adjusted for foreign-exchange would have been 16%. It's a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business. 
During the quarter, we also grow our volume in 3 of our 4 businesses, increasing global volume 2% with our consumer business leading the way growing at 3%. I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy where our teams in each of our 4 business units to start the year with North America leading the way. By any measure, North America achieved one of its best quarters ever, including record first quarter segment operating income of $198 million. The 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. 
Segment operating margin of 10.7%, also a first quarter record. The fourth consecutive quarter of at least 10% segment operating margin, a unit volume increase of nearly 2% with share gains in our key consumer replacement segment and improved price/mix versus raw materials compared to a year ago. In addition to these excellent results during the quarter, we also introduced our new Kelly tires joining the Goodyear Assurance All-Season in the profitable consumer replacement midtier segment. Last year, Assurance All-Season became the fastest new product to reach 1 million units sold. 
We launched new commercial truck tire products as well, including the Fuel Max LHS, making our commercial line up the most fuel-efficient in the industry. And we're piloting our e-commerce platform for Goodyear consumer replacement tire sales online. More than 3,000 locations have already signed up for the program, which is focused on making the tire buying process easier with our industry-leading dealer network. This is another form of both Goodyear's innovation and Goodyear's industry leadership. Our North American business continues to executive our strategies sustaining and growing it's profitability by responding to the need customers and consumers. 
Our team is delivering results, while building capabilities and our performance is indicative of their success and their momentum. And turning to Latin America, we improved profitability as we increased our volume by almost 10% during the quarter, building on the momentum that we established in 2014. We saw double-digit growth in consumer replacement and virtually every country in the region, as demand for a high-value added Goodyear products remained strong. We now have a completely refreshed product portfolio across Latin America, supported by the best distribution network in the region. 
Those 2 assets and our team's focus on winning in key market segments have allowed us to capitalize on growth opportunities even in markets in the region. With currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, but we also remain extremely optimistic about the region's long-term prospects. Looking at the Americas the common denominator we see in these markets is the robust demand for HVA tires. Demand which in some cases exceeds our supply and that demand will continue to grow. 
In fact, between now and 2019, we expect total industry demand for consumer tires to grow 10 million units per year in the Americas. However, that's a result of industry demand for HVA tires growing at 18 million units per year, while demand for low value-added products will decline by 8 million units per year over that same period. And that equates to an additional 90 million tires of HVA industry demand by 2019. 
To meet the growing demand for Goodyear brand HVA tires and to support our customers growth plans, we recently announced our new America's plant to be located in Mexico. It's our first new plant in the Americas in 25 years. The plant which will supply 6 million tires per year, when it comes online in 2017, will serve both the North America and Latin America regions. The new factory will be added to our existing initiatives to supply more HVA tires, including building incremental capacity through our prior CapEx investments, converting LVA capacity to HVA capacity and using operational excellence to improve output through efficiency gains. 
Included as part of our announced existing capital allocation plan, our new factory will be managed in line with our of enabling investments to achieve the required returns to drive increased profitability and shareholder value, while growing our business and industry competitiveness. And having recently met with many customers in Latin America, North America, their excitement and commitment to Goodyear is comparable. They view the investments as a tangible sign of Goodyear's commitment to growth. It was a clear demonstration to meet of the value of being a Goodyear partner. Shifting our attention to Europe. The impact of a weak euro accounted for nearly all of our year-over-year decrease in segment operating income. On the positive side, our core Goodyear brand premium tires in both consumer and commercial performed well in a difficult environment in the quarter. Our volumes were negatively affected by the growing presence of low-cost Asian imports, particularly in Eastern Europe. This is a trend we do .not see abating in the near-term and we'll continue to develop action plans to address it. 
Note that the situation we are encountering in Eastern Europe is not a new one to Goodyear. We seen these before in North America and Latin America, where our recent results demonstrate our ability to successfully develop and execute strategies to drive over profitable growth. And I'm confident we will do the same in Europe. We will focus on innovative tire technologies such as our EfficientGrip performance tire that earned AA double rating for wet grip and fuel efficiency, the highest grade afforded by EU standards. We'll also focus on brand building, customer service and reliability.
And our well-established distribution  network in the region will also serve as a competitive advantage. Looking ahead, we continue to see Europe as a slow growth competitive market, but one where we'll not deviate from our strategy of winning in targeted market segments where we can drive the value of the Goodyear brand. 
Finally, in Asia-Pacific, where we achieved a 15% operating margin, we increased our volume 9% in the quarter as we continue to see strong growth driven mainly by our consumer businesses in both China and India. In particular, we saw very strong consumer OE growth in China, as local manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, continue to develop their robust production and expansion plans both regionally and globally. And related to that and consistent with our strategy of winning in China, we opened a development center in Pulandian, China during the quarter. As our customers in the country continue to innovate and grow at a pace unequalled in the world, establishing a development  center will improve our speed to market, providing the superior service our customers need and expect. 
The development center is an investment in our future and will support our growth strategy in Asia and particularly in China. So in summary, our first quarter performance across all of regions provided a strong start to the year and gives us confidence about the remainder of 2015. Equally important, during the first quarter, we took further steps to build capabilities and drive sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the years to come. While we're pleased with our results, we're looking beyond the first quarter and the next quarter. As you heard me say before, we're running our business for the long-term. The strategies we have in place around the world are working and as evidenced by our North America business are delivering long-term sustainable value. Even so in the tire industry is a given. We are now experiencing just that in certain emerging markets that not so long ago had optimistic growth forecast. 
We accept that cyclicality and are committed to managing through it. For the remainder of this year, we will continue to leverage our strengths with the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for recovery in weaker markets while remaining true to our strategy. The growing demand for our industry-leading HVA products, the successful execution of our strategy and the capability of our teams that we will continue to grow profitably, increasing our earnings and value for shareholders, not only in the near-term, but in the long-term as well. 
I will now turn the call over to Laura."
275789,291601001,797091,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I will also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for",1895,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I will also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions. Turning to Slide 8. I want to highlight a few items on the income statement. Unit volumes increased 2% in the quarter with solid growth in 3 of our 4 business units. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies  reduced sales by almost $400 million year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved 2.5 points to 23.8% and our SOI margin was 9.7% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.82. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, most notably the recognition of deferred  income associated with the termination of a licensing agreement related to our former engineered products business. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.54. 
Additionally, in this first quarter, income tax expense increased following the release of our U.S. U.S. valuation allowance at year 2014. As mentioned previously, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years. As such, we have also provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental noncash tax expense for comparison purposes. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.65, up $0.09 versus last year on a comparable basis. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks first quarter 2014 segment operating income to first quarter 2015. Volume growth in the quarter created $23 million of increased year-over-year SOI. This was more than offset by the negative impact of higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs, which were primarily related to the fourth quarter warm weather driven production levels in Europe. The combination of these 2 factors generated a net unfavorable impact of $6 million. Lower raw material cost of $46 million, more than offset reduced price mix of $29 million for a net benefit of $17 million during the quarter. Cost savings actions of $68 million driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $62 million negative impact of inflation, which was driven in part by Venezuela. Foreign currency exchange with a headwind of $40 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion, with a decline from year end reflecting the normal working capital seasonality in our business and a $200 million repayment on our U.S. term loan earlier in the year. 
This cash balance includes $295 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we used $414 million of cash, improving about $100 million from the prior year, reflecting the increase in earnings. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong at nearly $1.1 billion. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12, I will start with North America. As Rich mentioned earlier, North America had another great quarter with record quarterly segment operating income of $198 million, which is the 23 consecutive  quarter of the year-over-year earnings growth and a clear example of a business creating sustainable value. In addition to the 27% increase in segment operating income, North America also achieved an operating margin of 10.7%, an impressive milestone of 4 consecutive quarters above 10%. 
North America's earnings were driven by strong price/mix versus raw materials as we continue to focus on selling innovative industry-leading tires that increased the value of the Goodyear brand. The demand for our products has allowed us to continue to improve our product mix, while capturing the decline in raw material costs. Volume was up almost 2%, driven by strong replacement demand for Goodyear branded consumer tires, including new products such as the Assurance All-Season and the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, as the volatility associated with a speculative buying of Chinese tires last year continues to work through the industry channels this year. 
As we have discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see strong demand for our premium branded consumer tires. We're leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and investing in North America to meet the increased demand. Our North America commercial truck volume also performed well in the first quarter. Total truck volume was up 6%. We are experiencing strong demand for our industry-leading fleet solutions and fuel-efficient tires, such as the Fuel Max, LHS tire. North America's results are evidenced that our strategy of targeting profitable market segments is working. That includes mixing up and products through market back innovation, pricing for the value of our tires and controlling our cost. 
Growth in North America is an attractive investment. Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 34% over last year's $110 million. The impacts of foreign currency translation and fourth quarter warm weather production cuts, reduced earnings in the quarter by $55 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. The volume decline was due to 2 factors: first, the discontinuation of our tire operations last year. And second, increased competition concentrated within our economy segments in Central and Eastern Europe. This is where we have seen additional pressure driven by, an increase in Asian import. 
These headwinds offset our volume and share increases year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segments in the region. In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment and we have gained share in replacement with the launch of our industry-leading new products such as and Fuel Max. 
While our European business will continue to be challenged by foreign currency headwinds throughout 2015, our product portfolio is strong and our team is taking steps to return our business there to higher levels of U.S. dollar profitability as the year progresses. In Asia Pacific, our first quarter volume of 5.7 million units, was about 9% higher than a year ago. And was driven by strong consumer share growth in 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets, China and India. Our Asia-Pacific business reported operating income of $67 million for the first quarter. The increase is mainly driven by volume growth, partially offset by higher conversion costs and lower price mix versus raw material costs. 
Overall, volume in our consumer businesses grew 14% with particular strength in OE. Although, our Australian operations continued to see challenges related to the weak macroeconomic conditions in that country. In Latin America, our volume increased about 10%. We saw strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the ongoing OE weakness in Brazil. 
Segment operating income was $53 million for the quarter, $11 million more than the prior year. Latin America benefited from price mix versus raw material cost and higher sales volumes during the quarter, which were partially offset by higher conversion costs and the impact of weaker currencies throughout the region. 
Overall, the increase in income was driven by improvements in our Venezuelan business, which was up $28 million year-over-year. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2014, our Venezuelan operations were negatively affected by labor negotiations that concluded in April of 2014. 
In addition, the commercial truck industry in Latin America was severely impacted by the recession like conditions in the region, with double-digit declines in both OE and replacement in Brazil. While Latin America is on most volatile region, our leaders are experienced and managing through these periods of uncertainty. In response to the rapid devaluation of the our team is acting quickly to enable us to realize our overall value proposition and drive earnings growth. 
On Slide 13 and 14, we have updated our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You will notice the most of the items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined  on our February call. There are a couple of exceptions. Namely, incremental headwinds in foreign exchange based on current spot rates and an improved outlook for Venezuela based on first quarter results. Although, we continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, the second quarter comparable is tougher given last year's 3% growth, which was the strongest quarter of the year. 
We continue to expect that the majority of our growth will be in the second half of the year. We now expect raw material cost to be 8%, lower than last year before cost-savings action. Due to slight increases in underlying raw material costs since February for carbon black and natural rubber. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. However, we continue to see our full year price/mix versus raw material benefit at around $200 million, unchanged from our February outlook. 
For the second quarter, we expect price/mix versus raws to be between $20 million to $50 million, as the majority of our year-over-year raw material benefit will occur in the second half. Regarding foreign currency translation, the dollar has continued to strengthen against major currencies. As a result, our foreign currency headwinds have increased. And we now see a full year impact to segment operating income of approximately $200 million based on current spot rates. 
As for our outlook on Venezuela, we earned about $20 million in income from Venezuela during the first quarter. This was the outcome of our experienced team on the ground working tirelessly to gain access to U.S. dollars to produce tires and fulfilled the strong local demand. 
Unit volume in Venezuela was up approximately 200,000 units during the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand and last year's labor related production slowdown. We had anticipated our earnings in Venezuela to be about 0 for the full year given the situation we faced at year end. However, in this first quarter, we were able to access sufficient U.S. dollars to pay for our imported raw materials. We are committed to our team and to our operations in Venezuela, where we've had a presence for more than 70 years. However, continuing to expect or predict earnings from Venezuela remains difficult. 
We included $20 million of earnings from Venezuela in the first quarter as part of our updated segment operating income outlook for the year. While we can't predict exactly what will happen in future quarters, our belief is that it will become harder to generate income in Venezuela in the near future. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14 and each is consistent with what we provided on our February year end call. 
In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces, but in total, is unchanged as we continued target 10% to 15% SOI growth for the year. We continue to execute on our balance capital allocation plan and as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. And we've repurchased $233 million so far under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We are committed to repurchasing additional shares in 2015 and 2016. Our CapEx outlook remains unchanged, as our new plant in Mexico was previously included in our outlook.

And I was very happy with the volumes that we had in the quarter.

And that's what we experiencing there right now. In terms of summer season and winter season going forward, when we look at how the channels are right now, I think probably more winter inventory was sold out than what we might have thought when we talked to you the last time.

So we think about volume quarter Clearly, we had a very good quarter in the context of demand for our HVA tires. But what we've done is built a business model there that's driving mix. It's now driving volume and diving positive experience in price/mix at the same time  time where we have more demand for HVA products and we can fill. And I'd also say that time what we have a very, very good both of OE business, it's driving consumers into the replacement market in those tires. That hasn't happened in 1 quarter it's a strategy we put in place. And in fact, it's working very well can see that in the results. In terms of the way we look at the industry, it is the thought that I would leave you with us, we have been and look continue to play in terms of volume. If you look at what's happened to maybe a little bit lengthy response, but the industry volumes have been really skewed, really going back to one of last year, and before that with the impacts of the tires. You have these big selling periods that are followed by significant reduced industry purchases dealers of loaded up. And when you comp those year-by-year, you have sort of a big share gain big share losses. Think about Goodyear in Q3 last year, we the industry. This quarter this year, we are ahead of the industry and that's because you got a follow me here in Q4 of 2012 as a rolled off, you had big selling into the channel Q1 of -- excuse me, that was 2013, Q1 of 2014 tires and had a big dislocation again. So as we look at this, we have to look at us. It's not necessarily relative to how purchase prebuys or restocking of low end tires impacts the industry, but rather how Goodyear is driving its business. We focused on the sellout, we focused on driven, we focused on our brand, and that's how we've been playing the game and that's how we're going to continue to play the game. And if I could forecast a little bit, you're going to see Q3 of this year, an odd industry, a dynamic because remember the last year, we had a big selling. Q1 next year, you're going to see the opposite again what's happen in the next year likely. So we focused on Goodyear, we focused on our customers and we focused on delivering and that's what you're seeing in our results."

I can confirm to you that won't change in terms of how we're looking at our volume growth over the period. And I would say that our 1% to 2% volume forecast, we're very comfortable with it at the moment. I would say in North America, clearly, in the quarter, there is an impact relative to Goodyear's performance versus the industry, and just of prebuys. But If you look at around the world, the comments I made in Latin America, we're gaining tremendous amount of traction there. Asia, we had very good growth in both the consumer replacement and the consumer OE business there. And again, back to North America, I think the demand for our products remains very, very strong. You've seen that in the quarter, and we only see that increasing. So certainly, I would say that the progress that we've seen is something that we've been working toward and we expect to deliver. Could it be at the higher end of the range, could it be above 2%, look, that's not something we're willing to forecast at this point.

This morning, I will review a few of our highlights, including our first quarter results, our record performance in North America and a few significant announcements we made recently. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
Our first quarter performance delivered record segment operating income of $391 million, with an operating margin of 10% despite the significant foreign exchange headwinds we encountered during the quarter. Segment operating income in the quarter grew 5% which, when adjusted for foreign exchange, would have been 16%. It's a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business. 
During the quarter, we also grow our volume in 3 of our 4 businesses, increasing global volume 2% with our consumer business leading the way growing at 3%. 
I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy by our teams in each of our 4 business units to start the year, with North America leading the way. By any measure, North America achieved one of its best quarters ever, including record first quarter segment operating income of $198 million. The 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. 
Segment operating margin of 10.7%, also a first quarter record. The fourth consecutive quarter of at least 10% segment operating margin, a unit volume increase of nearly 2% with share gains in our key consumer replacement segment and improved price/mix versus raw materials compared to a year ago. 
In addition to these excellent results during the quarter, we also introduced our new Kelly Edge line of tires joining the Goodyear Assurance All-Season in the profitable consumer replacement mid-tier segment. Last year, Assurance All-Season became the fastest new product to reach 1 million units sold. 
We launched new commercial truck tire products as well, including the Fuel Max LHS, making our commercial line up the most fuel-efficient in the industry. And we're piloting our e-commerce platform for Goodyear consumer replacement tire sales online. More than 3,000 locations have already signed up for the program, which is focused on making the tire-buying process easier with our industry-leading dealer network. This is another form of both Goodyear's innovation and Goodyear's industry leadership. Our North America business continues to execute our strategies, sustaining and growing its profitability by responding to the needs of customers and consumers. Our team is delivering results, while building capabilities and our performance is indicative of their success and their momentum. 
Now turning to Latin America. We improved profitability as we increased our volume by almost 10% during the quarter, building on the momentum that we established in 2014. We saw a double-digit growth in consumer replacement and virtually every country in the region, as demand for a high value-added Goodyear products remained strong. We now have a completely refreshed product portfolio across Latin America, supported by the best distribution network in the region. Those 2 assets and our team's focus on winning in key market segments have allowed us to capitalize on growth opportunities even in volatile markets in the region. With currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, but we also remain extremely optimistic about the region's long-term prospects. 
Looking at the Americas in tandem, the common denominator we see in these markets is the robust demand for HVA tires. Demand which, in some cases, exceeds our supply and that demand will continue to grow. 
In fact, between now and 2019, we expect total industry demand for consumer tires to grow 10 million units per year in the Americas. However, that's a result of industry demand for HVA tires growing at 18 million units per year, while demand for low value-added products will decline by 8 million units per year over that same period. Now that equates to an additional 90 million tires of HVA industry demand by 2019. 
To meet the growing demand for Goodyear brand HVA tires and to support our customers growth plans, we recently announced our new America's plant to be located in Mexico. It's our first new plant in the Americas in 25 years. The plant, which will supply 6 million tires per year when it comes online in 2017, will serve both the North America and Latin America regions. The new factory will be additive to our existing initiatives to supply more HVA tires, including building incremental capacity through our prior CapEx investments, converting LVA capacity to HVA capacity and using operational excellence to improve output through efficiency gains. 
Included as part of our announced existing capital allocation plan, our new factory will be managed in line with our key how-to of enabling investments to achieve the required returns to drive increased profitability and shareholder value, while growing our business and industry competitiveness. And having recently met with many customers in Latin America, North America, their excitement and commitment to Goodyear is comparable. They view the investments as a tangible sign of Goodyear's commitment to growth. It was a clear demonstration to me of the value of being a Goodyear partner. 
Shifting our attention to Europe. The impact of a weak euro accounted for nearly all of our year-over-year decrease in segment operating income. On the positive side, our core Goodyear brand premium tires in both consumer and commercial performed well in a difficult environment in the quarter. Our volumes were negatively affected by the growing presence of low-cost Asian imports, particularly in Eastern Europe. This is a trend we do not see abating in the near term, and we will continue to develop action plans to address it. 
Note that the situation we are encountering in Eastern Europe is not a new one to Goodyear. We've seen these before in North America and Latin America where our recent results demonstrate our ability to successfully develop and execute strategies to drive over profitable growth, and I'm confident we'll do the same in Europe. We will focus on innovative tire technologies, such as our EfficientGrip performance tire that earned a AA rating for wet grip and fuel efficiency, the highest grade afforded by EU standards. We'll also focus on brand building, customer service and reliability, and our well-established distribution  network in the region will also serve as a competitive advantage. Looking ahead, we continue to see Europe as a slow growth competitive market, but one where we will not deviate from our strategy of winning in targeted market segments where we can drive the value of the Goodyear brand. 
Finally, in Asia-Pacific, where we achieved a 15% operating margin, we increased our volume 9% in the quarter as we continue to see strong growth driven mainly by our consumer businesses in both China and India. In particular, we saw a very strong consumer OE growth in China as local manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, continue to develop their robust production and expansion plans both regionally and globally. And related to that and consistent with our strategy of winning in China, we opened a development center in Pulandian, China during the quarter. As our customers in the country continue to innovate and grow at a pace unequaled in the world, establishing a development center will improve our speed to market, providing the superior service our customers need and expect. The development center is an investment in our future and will support our growth strategy in Asia and particularly in China. 
So in summary, our first quarter performance across all of our regions provided a strong start to the year and gives us confidence about the remainder of 2015. Equally important, during the first quarter, we took further steps to build capabilities and drive sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the years to come. 
While we're pleased with our results, we're looking beyond the first quarter and the next quarter. As you've heard me say before, we're running our business for the long term. The strategies we have in place around the world are working and, as evidenced by our North America business, are delivering long-term sustainable value. Even so, cyclicality in the tire industry is a given. We're now experiencing just that in certain emerging markets that not so long ago had optimistic growth forecast. We accept that cyclicality and are committed to managing through it. 
For the remainder of this year, we'll continue to leverage our strengths, where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for recovery in weaker markets while remaining true to our strategy. The growing demand for our industry-leading HVA products, the successful execution of our strategy and the capability of our teams that we will continue to grow profitably, increasing our earnings and value for shareholders not only in the near term, but in the long term as well. 
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter.

Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I want to highlight a few items on the income statement. Unit volumes increased 2% in the quarter with solid growth in 3 of our 4 business units. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by almost $400 million year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved 2.5 points to 23.8% and our SOI margin was 9.7% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.82. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, most notably the recognition of deferred income associated with the termination of a licensing agreement related to our former engineered products business. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.54. 
Additionally, in this first quarter, income tax expense increased following the release of our U.S. U.S. valuation allowance at year-end 2014. As mentioned previously, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years. As such, we have also provided an adjusted EPS, excluding this incremental noncash tax expense for comparison purposes. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.65, up $0.09 versus last year on a comparable basis. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks first quarter 2014 segment operating income to first quarter 2015. Volume growth in the quarter created $23 million of increased year-over-year SOI. This was more than offset by the negative impact of higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs, which were primarily related to the fourth quarter warm weather driven production levels in Europe. The combination of these 2 factors generated a net unfavorable impact of $6 million. Lower raw material cost of $46 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $29 million for a net benefit of $17 million during the quarter. 
Cost savings actions of $68 million driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $62 million negative impact of inflation, which was driven in part by Venezuela. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $40 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the euro. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion with the decline from year-end, reflecting the normal working capital seasonality in our business and a $200 million repayment on our U.S. term loan earlier in the year. This cash balance includes $295 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the quarter. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we used $414 million of cash, improving about $100 million from the prior year, reflecting the increase in earnings. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong at nearly $1.1 billion. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12, I'll start with North America. As Rich mentioned earlier, North America had another great quarter with record quarterly segment operating income of $198 million, which is the 23rd consecutive  quarter of year-over-year earnings growth and a clear example of a business creating sustainable value. In addition to the 27% increase in segment operating income, North America also achieved an operating margin of 10.7%, an impressive milestone of 4 consecutive quarters above 10%. 
North America's earnings were driven by strong price/mix versus raw materials, as we continue to focus on selling innovative industry-leading tires that increased the value of the Goodyear brand. The demand for our products has allowed us to continue to improve our product mix, while capturing the decline in raw material costs. Volume was up almost 2%, driven by strong replacement demand for Goodyear branded consumer tires including new products, such as the Assurance All-Season and the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure as the volatility associated with a speculative buying of Chinese tires last year continues to work through the industry channels this year. 
As we have discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see strong demand for our premium branded consumer tires. We're leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and investing in North America to meet the increased demand. 
Our North America commercial truck volume also performed well in the first quarter. Total truck volume was up 6%. We are experiencing strong demand for our industry-leading fleet solutions and fuel-efficient tires, such as the Fuel Max LHS steer tire. North America's results are evidenced that our strategy of targeting profitable market segments is working. That includes mixing up and products through market-back innovation, pricing for the value of our tires and controlling our costs. Growth in North America is an attractive investment. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 34% over last year's $110 million. The impacts of foreign currency translation and fourth quarter warm weather production cuts reduced earnings in the quarter by $55 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. The volume decline was due to 2 factors: first, the discontinuation of our farm tire operations last year. And second, increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This is where we have seen additional pressure driven by an increase in Asian import. These headwinds offset our volume and share increases year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segments in the region. 
In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment and we have gained share in replacement with the launch of our industry-leading new products, such as KMAX and Fuel Max. While our European business will continue to be challenged by foreign currency headwinds throughout 2015, our product portfolio is strong and our team is taking steps to return our business there to higher levels of U.S. dollar profitability as the year progresses. 
In Asia Pacific, our first quarter volume of 5.7 million units was about 9% higher than a year ago and was driven by strong consumer share growth in 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets, China and India. Our Asia Pacific business reported operating income of $67 million for the first quarter. The increase is mainly driven by volume growth, partially offset by higher conversion cost and lower price/mix versus raw material cost. Overall, volume in our consumer businesses grew 14% with particular strength in OE, although our Australian operations continued to see challenges related to the weak macroeconomic conditions in that country. 
In Latin America, our volume increased about 10%. We saw a strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the ongoing OE weakness in Brazil. Segment operating income was $53 million for the quarter, $11 million more than the prior year. Latin America benefited from price/mix versus raw material costs and higher sales volumes during the quarter, which were partially offset by higher conversion costs and the impact of weaker currencies throughout the region. Overall, the increase in income was driven by improvements in our Venezuelan business, which was up $28 million year-over-year. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2014, our Venezuelan operations were negatively affected by labor negotiations that concluded in April of 2014. 
In addition, the commercial truck industry in Latin America was severely impacted by the recession like conditions in the region with double-digit declines in both OE and replacement in Brazil. While Latin America is on most volatile region, our leaders are experienced in managing through these periods of uncertainty. In response to the rapid devaluation of the real our team is acting quickly to enable us to realize our overall value proposition and drive earnings growth. 
On Slides 13 and 14, we have updated our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice the most of the items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our February call. There are a couple of exceptions namely, incremental headwinds in foreign exchange based on current spot rates and an improved outlook for Venezuela based on first quarter results. Although we continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, the second quarter comparable is tougher given last year's 3% growth, which was the strongest quarter of the year. 
We continue to expect that the majority of our growth will be in the second half of the year. We now expect raw material cost to be 8% lower than last year before cost-savings action, due to slight increases in underlying raw material cost since February for carbon black and natural rubber. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. However, we continue to see our full year price/mix versus raw material benefit at around $200 million, unchanged from our February outlook. 
For the second quarter, we expect price/mix versus raws to be between $20 million to $50 million, as the majority of our year-over-year raw material benefit will occur in the second half. Regarding foreign currency translation, the dollar has continued to strengthen against major currencies. As a result, our foreign currency headwinds have increased. And we now see a full year impact to segment operating income of approximately $200 million based on current spot rate.
As for our outlook on Venezuela, we earned about $20 million in income from Venezuela during the first quarter. This was the outcome of our experienced team on the ground working tirelessly to gain access to U.S. dollars to produce tires and fulfill the strong local demand. 
Unit volume in Venezuela was up approximately 200,000 units during the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand and last year's labor-related production slowdown. We had anticipated our earnings in Venezuela to be about 0 for the full year, given the situation we faced at year-end. However, in the first quarter, we were able to access sufficient U.S. dollars to pay for our imported raw materials. We are committed to our team and to our operations in Venezuela, where we've had a presence for more than 70 years. However, continuing to expect or predict earnings from Venezuela remains difficult. 
We've included $20 million of earnings from Venezuela in the first quarter as part of our updated segment operating income outlook for the year. While we can't predict exactly what will happen in future quarters, our belief is that it will become harder to generate income in Venezuela in the near future. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14 and each is consistent with what we provided on our February year-end call. 
In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces but, in total, is unchanged as we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth for the year. We continue to execute on our balance capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization, and we've repurchased $233 million so far under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We are committed to repurchasing additional shares in 2015 and 2016. Our CapEx outlook remains unchanged, as our new plant in Mexico was previously included in our outlook. 
Now we'll open the line up for your questions."

So I think as we look at our performance in the quarter and the value proposition that we're putting the marketplace today in terms of our products in terms of the supply, what we see is the balanced equation that we put into the market place as value proposition marketplace is one that we're getting rewarded for regardless of the situation relative to tariffs in marketplace. So we view that we have a very positive outlook in terms of our price/mix versus raw materials for North America."

As you know, Q2 and Q3 tend to be heavier on summer and heavier on winter. So they're a bit more indicative of, let's say, trends that we expect for the year. But you're right to point out, we were very pleased with our performance in sort of our key branded targeted market segments, particularly around performance in SUV. And I was very happy with the volumes that we had in the quarter. Also, we had headwinds, as you mentioned, as well in Eastern Europe, where we're seeing more volumes coming in of low cost to Asian or Chinese tires, which is, I think what we've said in the past, is indicative of sort of the location of that product just relocates around the world when you have tariffs going on in another part of the world. And that's what we're experiencing there right now. In terms of summer season and winter season going forward when we look at how the channels are right now, I think probably more winter inventory was sold out than we might have thought when we talked to you the last time. But as we sit here and we look at what were 3 essentially warm winters over the past few years, we're certainly, again, working on a balanced equation to figure out how to handle the balance of the year.

It certainly hurts us in other ways. But just sort of the economy that's indigenous to those consumers over there, we see a little bit of a lift. So that gives us a little bit more optimism on the summer markets. But Europe, as I said, we continue to see it as being a slow-growth economy going forward.

I think most investors we spoke to were [indiscernible] for a decline there, just given the hangover from tariff, prebuy and [indiscernible] figures that everyone is seeing.

How do you expect that to be impacted by the tariff and then longer term by dividing percentage tires between the HVA as highlighted on Slide 5?"

So I",512,"So Ryan, I would tell you the performance both from a profitably standpoint and from a volume standpoint, and I would say competitive standpoint in the market, is really the result of the actions that the teams in place over the past number of years. So I wouldn't have you think about volume in the sense of just 1 quarter. Clearly, we had a very good volume quarter in the context of demand for our HVA tires. But what we've done is built a business model there that's driving mix, it's now driving volume and driving a positive price/mix at the same time at a time where we have more demand for HVA products than we can fill. And I'd also say the time where we have a very, very good book of OE business that's driving consumers into the replacement market to get those tires. That hasn't happened in 1 quarter or 1 year. It's the strategy we put in place. And in fact, it's working very well and I think you see that in the results. In terms of the way to look at the industry, I guess, the thought that I would leave you with is, we have been and will look continue to play our game in terms of volume. If you look at what happened and it's -- maybe a little bit lengthy response, but the industry volumes have been really skewed, really going back to Q1 of last year, and we could keep arguing before that with the impacts of the tariffs. You had these big selling periods that are followed by significant reduced industry purchases for selling that dealers have loaded up. And when you comp those a year later, you have sort of a big share gains and big share losses. Think about Goodyear in Q3 last year, we trail the industry. This quarter, Q1 of this year, we're ahead of the industry and that's because you got to follow me here. But in Q4 of 2012 as the tariffs rolled off, you had a big selling into the channel, Q1 of -- excuse me, that was 2013. Q1 of 2014, dealers weren't buying tires, and we had a big dislocation again. So as we look at this, we have to look at us. It's not necessarily relative to how purchase, prebuys or restocking of low-end tires impacts the industry, but rather how Goodyear is driving its business. We focus on sellout. We focus on miles driven. We focus on our brand. And that's how we've been playing the game, and that's how we're going to continue to play the game. And if I could forecast a little bit, you're going to see Q3 of this year, an odd industry, a dynamic because remember last year, we had a big selling. Q1 next year, you're going to see the opposite again of what's happened this year more than likely. So I'd say, we focus on Goodyear, we focus on our customers and we focus on delivering, and that's what you're seeing in our results."

Really, I'm thrilled with the volume performance that we've had in Latin America this quarter, and it really builds on the momentum that we put in place last year around putting new products in place, I think we had 12 new product introductions last year. We've engaged our dealers in a more aggressive way. We had double-digit volume increases now in virtually every country in Latin America in the quarter, followed on by significant volume increases last year as well. So as we look at the business model we're putting in place and then add, on top of that, the announcement of a factory for the Americas and Latin America, I would say it is sustainable and it is something that has a lot of momentum right now despite what are obviously difficult economies in Brazil, in Venezuela and in Argentina. But we're committed to the long term. And in terms of Chinese tires or low-end tires, we did see a lot of those come into Latin America. The last time, we had tariffs in the U.S. But certainly with the decreasing -- the devaluations of the currency in Latin America right now, there is less imports in there, which certainly is a benefit to us, a benefit to all local manufacturers in the region."

For instance, we have a situation in Brazil where we struggled a bit more because as we're seeing there, the decrease in raw materials is actually turning into a bit of the headwind given the decrease of the currency there. So what we're seeing in Latin America is not strong price/mix versus raw materials or at least in Brazil, I should say, because of our ability to recover that raw material cost in the decreasing currency environment. So we've got that going on there. We expect that we'll be able to deal with that.

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review a few of our highlights, including our first quarter results, our record performance in North America and a few significant announcements we made recently. Laura will follow with a",1486,"Thank you, Christina. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review a few of our highlights, including our first quarter results, our record performance in North America and a few significant announcements we made recently. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
Our first quarter performance delivered record segment operating income of $391 million, with an operating margin of 10% despite the significant foreign exchange headwinds we encountered during the quarter. Segment operating income in the quarter grew 5%, which when adjusted for foreign exchange, would have been 16%. It's a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business. 
During the quarter, we also grew our volume in 3 of our 4 businesses, increasing global volume 2%, with our consumer business leading the way, growing at 3%. 
I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy by our teams in each of our 4 business units to start the year, with North America leading the way. By any measure, North America achieved one of its best quarters ever, including: record first quarter segment operating income of $198 million, the 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth; segment operating margin of 10.7%, also a first quarter record; the fourth consecutive quarter of at least 10% segment operating margin; a unit volume increase of nearly 2%, with share gains in our key consumer replacement segment; and improved price/mix versus raw materials compared to a year ago. 
In addition to these excellent results during the quarter, we also introduced our new Kelly Edge line of tires, joining the Goodyear Assurance All-Season in the profitable consumer replacement mid-tier segment. Last year, Assurance All-Season became the fastest new product to reach 1 million units sold. 
We launched new commercial truck tire products as well, including the Fuel Max LHS, making our commercial lineup the most fuel-efficient in the industry. And we're piloting our e-commerce platform for Goodyear consumer replacement tire sales online. More than 3,000 locations have already signed up for the program, which is focused on making the tire-buying process easier with our industry-leading dealer network. This is another form of both Goodyear's innovation and Goodyear's industry leadership. Our North America business continues to execute our strategy, sustaining and growing its profitability by responding to the needs of customers and consumers. Our team is delivering results while building capabilities, and our performance is indicative of their success and their momentum. 
Now turning to Latin America. We improved profitability, as we increased our volume by almost 10% during the quarter, building on the momentum that we established in 2014. We saw double-digit growth in consumer replacement in virtually every country in the region, as demand for high value-added Goodyear products remained strong. We now have a completely refreshed product portfolio across Latin America, supported by the best distribution network in the region. Those 2 assets and our team's focus on winning in key market segments have allowed us to capitalize on growth opportunities, even in volatile markets in the region. With currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, but we also remain extremely optimistic about the region's long-term prospects. 
Looking at the Americas in tandem, the common denominator we see in these markets is the robust demand for HVA tires. Demand which, in some cases, exceeds our supply. And that demand will continue to grow. 
In fact, between now and 2019, we expect total industry demand for consumer tires to grow 10 million units per year in the Americas. However, that's a result of industry demand for HVA tires growing at 18 million units per year, while demand for low value-added products will decline by 8 million units per year over that same period. Now that equates to an additional 90 million tires of HVA industry demand by 2019. 
To meet the growing demand for Goodyear brand's HVA tires and to support our customers' growth plans, we recently announced our new Americas plant to be located in Mexico. It's our first new plant in the Americas in 25 years. The plant, which will supply 6 million tires per year when it comes online in 2017, will serve both the North America and Latin America regions. The new factory will be additive to our existing initiatives to supply more HVA tires, including building incremental capacity through our prior CapEx investments, converting LVA capacity to HVA capacity and using operational excellence to improve output through efficiency gains. 
Included as part of our announced existing capital allocation plan, our new factory will be managed in line with our key how-to of enabling investments to achieve the required returns to drive increased profitability and shareholder value, while growing our business and industry competitiveness. And having recently met with many customers in Latin America and North America, their excitement and commitment to Goodyear is palpable. They view the investments as a tangible sign of Goodyear's commitment to growth. It was a clear demonstration to me of the value of being a Goodyear partner. 
Shifting our attention to Europe. The impact of a weak euro accounted for nearly all of our year-over-year decrease in segment operating income. On the positive side, our core Goodyear brand premium tires in both consumer and commercial performed well in a difficult environment in the quarter. Our volumes were negatively affected by the growing presence of low-cost Asian imports, particularly in Eastern Europe. This is a trend we do not see abating in the near term, and we will continue to develop action plans to address it. 
Note that the situation we are encountering in Eastern Europe is not a new one to Goodyear. We've seen these before in North America and Latin America, where our recent results demonstrate our ability to successfully develop and execute strategies to drive our profitable growth, and I'm confident we'll do the same in Europe. We will focus on innovative tire technologies, such as our EfficientGrip performance tire that earned a AA rating for wet grip and fuel efficiency, the highest grade afforded by EU standards. We'll also focus on brand building, customer service and reliability, and our well-established distribution  network in the region will also serve as a competitive advantage. Looking ahead, we continue to see Europe as a slow-growth competitive market, but one where we will not deviate from our strategy of winning in targeted market segments where we can drive the value of the Goodyear brand. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific, where we achieved a 15% operating margin, we increased our volume 9% in the quarter as we continued to see strong growth driven mainly by our consumer businesses in both China and India. In particular, we saw a very strong consumer OE growth in China, as local manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, continue to develop their robust production and expansion plans, both regionally and globally. And related to that and consistent with our strategy of winning in China, we opened a development center in Pulandian, China during the quarter. As our customers in the country continue to innovate and grow at a pace unequaled in the world, establishing a development center will improve our speed to market, providing the superior service our customers need and expect. The development center is an investment in our future and will support our growth strategy in Asia and particularly in China. 
So in summary, our first quarter performance across all of our regions provided a strong start to the year and gives us confidence about the remainder of 2015. Equally important, during the first quarter, we took further steps to build capabilities and drive sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the years to come. 
While we're pleased with our results, we're looking beyond the first quarter and the next quarter. As you've heard me say before, we're running our business for the long term. The strategies we have in place around the world are working, and as evidenced by our North America business, are delivering long-term sustainable value. Even so, cyclicality in the tire industry is a given. We're now experiencing just that in certain emerging markets that not so long ago had optimistic growth forecasts. We accept that cyclicality and are committed to managing through it. 
For the remainder of this year, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for recovery in weaker markets, while remaining true to our strategy. The growing demand for our industry-leading HVA products, the successful execution of our strategy and the capability of our teams [Audio Gap] that we will continue to grow profitably, increasing our earnings and value for shareholders, not only in the near term, but in the long term as well. 
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."
275789,291601001,797610,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter.

Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I want to highlight a few items on the income statement. Unit volumes increased 2% in the quarter, with solid growth in 3 of our 4 business units. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by almost $400 million year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved 2.5 points to 23.8% and our SOI margin was 9.7% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.82. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, most notably the recognition of deferred income associated with the termination of a licensing agreement related to our former engineered products business. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.54. 
Additionally, in this first quarter, income tax expense increased following the release of our U.S. valuation allowance at year end 2014. As mentioned previously, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years. As such, we have also provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental, noncash tax expense for comparison purposes. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.65, up $0.09 versus last year on a comparable basis. 
The step chart on Slide 9 walks first quarter 2014 segment operating income to first quarter 2015. Volume growth in the quarter created $23 million of increased year-over-year SOI. This was more than offset by the negative impact of higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs, which were primarily related to the fourth quarter warm weather-driven production levels in Europe. The combination of these 2 factors generated a net unfavorable impact of $6 million. Lower raw material costs of $46 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $29 million, for a net benefit of $17 million during the quarter. 
Cost savings actions of $68 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $62 million negative impact of inflation, which was driven in part by Venezuela. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $40 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion, with the decline from year end reflecting the normal working capital seasonality in our business and a $200 million repayment on our U.S. term loan earlier in the year. This cash balance includes $295 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the quarter. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we used $414 million of cash, improving about $100 million from the prior year, reflecting the increase in earnings. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong at nearly $1.1 billion. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12, I'll start with North America. As Rich mentioned earlier, North America had another great quarter, with record quarterly segment operating income of $198 million, which is the 23rd consecutive  quarter of year-over-year earnings growth and a clear example of a business creating sustainable value. In addition to the 27% increase in segment operating income, North America also achieved an operating margin of 10.7%, an impressive milestone of 4 consecutive quarters above 10%. 
North America's earnings were driven by strong price/mix versus raw materials, as we continue to focus on selling innovative industry-leading tires that increase the value of the Goodyear brand. The demand for our products has allowed us to continue to improve our product mix while capturing the decline in raw material costs. Volume was up almost 2%, driven by strong replacement demand for Goodyear branded consumer tires, including new products such as the Assurance All-Season and the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, as the volatility associated with the speculative buying of Chinese tires last year continues to work through the industry channels this year. 
As we have discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see strong demand for our premium branded consumer tires. We're leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and investing in North America to meet the increased demand. 
Our North America commercial truck volume also performed well in the first quarter. Total truck volume was up 6%. We are experiencing strong demand for our industry-leading fleet solutions and fuel-efficient tires, such as the Fuel Max LHS steer tire. North America's results are evidence that our strategy of targeting profitable market segments is working. That includes mixing up in products through market-back innovation, pricing for the value of our tires and controlling our costs. Growth in North America is an attractive investment. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 34% over last year's $110 million. The impacts of foreign currency translation and fourth quarter warm weather production cuts reduced earnings in the quarter by $55 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. The volume decline was due to 2 factors: first, the discontinuation of our farm tire operations last year. And second, increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This is where we have seen additional pressure, driven by an increase in Asian imports. These headwinds offset our volume and share increases year-over-year in the HVA, performance and SUV segments in the region. 
In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment and we have gained share in replacement with the launch of our industry-leading new products, such as KMAX and Fuel Max. While our European business will continue to be challenged by foreign currency headwinds throughout 2015, our product portfolio is strong and our team is taking steps to return our business there to higher levels of U.S. dollar profitability as the year progresses. 
In Asia Pacific, our first quarter volume of 5.7 million units was about 9% higher than a year ago and was driven by strong consumer share growth in 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets, China and India. Our Asia Pacific business reported operating income of $67 million for the first quarter. The increase is mainly driven by volume growth, partially offset by higher conversion cost and lower price/mix versus raw material cost. Overall, volume in our consumer businesses grew 14%, with particular strength in OE, although our Australian operations continued to see challenges related to the weak macroeconomic conditions in that country. 
In Latin America, our volume increased about 10%. We saw strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the ongoing OE weakness in Brazil. Segment operating income was $53 million for the quarter, $11 million more than the prior year. Latin America benefited from price/mix versus raw material costs and higher sales volumes during the quarter, which were partially offset by higher conversion costs and the impact of weaker currencies throughout the region. Overall, the increase in income was driven by improvements in our Venezuelan business, which was up $28 million year-over-year. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2014, our Venezuelan operations were negatively affected by labor negotiations that concluded in April of 2014. 
In addition, the commercial truck industry in Latin America was severely impacted by the recession-like conditions in the region, with double-digit declines in both OE and replacement in Brazil. While Latin America is our most volatile region, our leaders are experienced in managing through these periods of uncertainty. In response to the rapid devaluation of the real, our team is acting quickly to enable us to realize our overall value proposition and drive earnings growth. 
On Slides 13 and 14, we have updated our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that most of the items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our February call. There are a couple of exceptions: namely, incremental headwinds in foreign exchange based on current spot rates and an improved outlook for Venezuela based on first quarter results. Although we continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, the second quarter comparable is tougher given last year's 3% growth, which was the strongest quarter of the year. 
We continue to expect that the majority of our growth will be in the second half of the year. We now expect raw material cost to be 8% lower than last year before cost-savings actions, due to slight increases in underlying raw material cost since February for carbon black and natural rubber. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. However, we continue to see our full year price/mix versus raw materials benefit at around $200 million, unchanged from our February outlook. 
For the second quarter, we expect price/mix versus raws to be between $20 million to $50 million, as the majority of our year-over-year raw materials benefit will occur in the second half. Regarding foreign currency translation, the dollar has continued to strengthen against major currencies. As a result, our foreign currency headwinds have increased. And we now see a full year impact to segment operating income of approximately $200 million, based on current spot rates.
As for our outlook on Venezuela, we earned about $20 million in income from Venezuela during the first quarter. This was the outcome of our experienced team on the ground working tirelessly to gain access to U.S. dollars to produce tires and fulfill the strong local demand. 
Unit volume in Venezuela was up approximately 200,000 units during the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand and last year's labor-related production slowdown. We had anticipated our earnings in Venezuela to be about 0 for the full year, given the situation we faced at year end. However, in the first quarter, we were able to access sufficient U.S. dollars to pay for our imported raw materials. We are committed to our team and to our operations in Venezuela, where we've had a presence for more than 70 years. However, continuing to expect or predict earnings from Venezuela remains difficult. 
We've included $20 million of earnings from Venezuela in the first quarter as part of our updated segment operating income outlook for the year. While we can't predict exactly what will happen in future quarters, our belief is that it will become harder to generate income in Venezuela in the near future. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14 and each is consistent with what we provided on our February year-end call. 
In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces, but in total is unchanged, as we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth for the year. We continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization, and we've repurchased $233 million so far under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We are committed to repurchasing additional shares in 2015 and 2016. Our CapEx outlook remains unchanged, as our new plant in Mexico was previously included in our outlook. 
Now we'll open the line up for your questions."

But you're right to point out, we were very pleased with our performance in sort of our key branded targeted market segments, particularly around performance and SUV. And I was very happy with the volumes that we had in the quarter. Also, we had headwinds, as you mentioned as well, in Eastern Europe, where we're seeing more volumes coming in of low-cost Asian or Chinese tires, which is I think what we've said in the past, is indicative of sort of the location of that product, just relocates around the world when you have tariffs going on in another part of the world. And that's what we're experiencing there right now. In terms of summer season and winter season going forward, when we look at how the channels are right now, I think probably more winter inventory was sold out than we might have thought when we talked to you the last time. But as we sit here and we look at what were 3 essentially warm winters over the past few years, we're certainly, again, working on a balanced equation to figure out how to handle the balance of the year.

So I wouldn't have you think about volume in the sense of just one quarter. Clearly, we had a very good volume quarter in the context of demand for our HVA tires. But what we've done is built a business model there that's driving mix, it's now driving volume and driving a positive price/mix at the same time at a time where we have more demand for HVA products than we can fill. And I'd also say at a time where we have a very, very good book of OE business that's driving consumers into the replacement market to get those tires. That hasn't happened in one quarter or one year. It's a strategy we put in place. And in fact, it's working very well and I think you see that in the results. In terms of the way to look at the industry, I guess the thought that I would leave you with is, we have been and will continue to play our game in terms of volume. If you look at what's happened and it's a maybe, a little bit lengthy response, but the industry volumes have been really skewed, really going back to Q1 of last year, and we could argue even before that, with the impacts of the tariffs. You have these big sell-in periods that are followed by significant reduced industry purchases for sell-ins, dealers have loaded up. And when you comp those a year later, you have sort of big share gains and big share losses. Think about Goodyear in Q3 last year, we trailed the industry. This quarter, Q1 of this year, we're ahead of the industry, and that's because, you got to follow me here, but in Q4 of 2012, as the tariffs rolled off, you had a big sell-in into the channel, Q1 of -- excuse me, that was 2013. Q1 of 2014, dealers weren't buying tires, and we had a big dislocation again. So as we look at this, the way you have to look at us, is not necessarily relative to how purchase, prebuys or restocking of low-end tires impacts the industry, but rather how Goodyear is driving its business. We focus on sellout. We focus on miles driven. We focus on our brand. And that's how we've been playing the game, and that's how we're going to continue to play the game. And if I could forecast a little bit, you're going to see Q3 of this year, an odd industry dynamic because remember last year, we had a big sell-in. Q1 next year, you're going to see the opposite again of what's happened this year, more than likely. So what I'd say, we focus on Goodyear, we focus on our customers and we focus on delivering, and that's what you're seeing in our results."

Really, I'm thrilled with the volume performance that we've had in Latin America this quarter, and it really builds on the momentum that we put in place last year around putting new products in place, I think we had 12 new product introductions last year. We've engaged our dealers in a more aggressive way. We've had double-digit volume increases now in virtually every country in Latin America in the quarter, followed on by significant volume increases last year as well. So as we look at the business model we're putting in place, and then add on top of that, the investment of a factory for the Americas and Latin America, I would say it is sustainable and it is something that has a lot of momentum right now, despite what are obviously difficult economies in Brazil, in Venezuela and in Argentina. But we're committed to the long term. And in terms of Chinese tires or low-end tires, we did see a lot of those come into Latin America the last time we had tariffs in the U.S. But certainly with the decreasing -- the devaluations of the currency in Latin America right now, there is less imports in there, which certainly is a benefit to us, a benefit to all local manufacturers in the region."

For instance, we have a situation in Brazil where we struggle a bit more, because as we're seeing there, the decrease in raw materials is actually turning into a bit of a headwind given the decrease of the currency there. So what we're seeing in Latin America is not as strong price/mix versus raw materials, or at least in Brazil, I should say, because of our ability to recover that raw material cost in the decreasing currency environment. So we've got that going on there. We expect that we'll be able to deal with that.

As you know, we tend to be -- we have to be very frugal with our cash and very analytical about the investments that we make. And as we looked at it, we looked at the industry demand by tire type, we looked at what our competitors were doing from a capacity standpoint. We looked at when that capacity is coming online, and we still concluded that the demand for HVA tires was there for the industry.

And I would say that our 1% to 2% volume forecast, we're very comfortable with at the moment. I would say in North America, clearly, in the quarter, there is an impact relative to Goodyear's performance versus the industry and just the sways of prebuys. But if you look at around the world, the comments I made in Latin America, we're gaining tremendous amount of traction there. Asia, we had very good growth in both the consumer replacement and the consumer OE business there. And again, back to North America, I think the demand for our products remains very, very strong. You've seen that in the quarter, and we only see that increasing. So certainly, I would say that the progress that we've seen is something that we've been working toward and we expect to deliver. Could it be at the higher end of the range? Could it be above 2%? Look, that's not something we're willing to forecast at this point.

This morning, I will view highlights from our outstanding second quarter, provide an update on how the macroeconomics in our regions are affecting our business, and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions. 
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $556 million, a record for any quarter in the company's history, and a 21% improvement versus last year. Also, if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, our operating performance improved by 28% in the quarter. These were simply excellent results for our team. 
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter results, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $947 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. By comparison, that higher than our full year segment operating income in 2010. In addition, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 13% in the second quarter despite significant foreign currency headwinds and regional macroeconomic challenges. Leading the way, our North America business delivered record segment operating income and nearly a 16% segment operating margin, its highest in my 15 years at Goodyear and likely longer than that. In addition, 3 of our 4 global businesses delivered operating margins of greater than 10% in tougher than expected economic environments. 
Taken in total, our record second quarter performance reflects the strength and disciplined execution of our strategy. We believe that strength comes largely from the integration of the key how-to's on our strategy road map, innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence, and operational excellence supported by an aligned and collaborative team. While each is a significant element in our plan, their value multiplies when they're integrated. Our current results reflect that value, and we've only just begun to tap into its full potential. 
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SPUs, as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for each for the remainder of the year. North America delivered $321 million of segment operating income, a record for any quarter. This performance was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating the earnings power of our value proposition in a strong market. During the quarter, demand in our replacement business remains solid, and we began to see the benefits of our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. Early demand for these tires has exceeded our expectations as our market-back innovation has allowed us to bring HVA attributes to the mid-tier segments. Similarly, we've increased our share in OE, which continues to deliver profitable results by selling the HVAC products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and the Ensurance Fuel Max on some of the most popular vehicles in line with our strategy. The results are paying dividends not only in our OE performance, but also in the Goodyear brand replacement full through as consumers visit our online dealers. The enhancements to our product mix have been an important enabler of North America's improved value proposition. 
During the first half, we also began to roll out our new E-commerce platform for consumer replacement tires. We developed our online sales strategy to reduce friction or in other words, to make the tire-buying process easier for consumers. The program is still in the early stages but it has met or exceeded our initial expectations while providing many key learnings needed to implement successfully over the long term as consumers change their buying habits. We remain confident that this program, with our industry-leading dealer network and more than 4,000 locations enrolled to date, will drive profitability through the value chain. 
Our commercial truck tire business also had a strong second quarter based on the robust demand for our industry-leading products. In June, we unveiled a new commercial tire product, the Endurance WHA for waste haul fleets, which will be available later this year. Our total portfolio of commercial truck tire offerings has never been better and combined with our fleet service model, that's the gold standard of the industry, that makes Goodyear the clear leader -- the clear industry leader in the commercial truck business. 
Across all of our segments in North America, our value proposition has allowed us to excel in a market where drivers of demand have remained very strong. New passenger vehicle sales are at the highest in the decade, miles driven for the first 5 months of the year was at an all time record,and we project miles driven for the full year to be a record as well. And year-to-date truck tonnage has increased 3% over the same period last year. All are leading indicators for Goodyear markets, and we believe the underlying fundamentals will remain favorable for some time. 
We've consistently said that it was a question of when, not if, industry fundamentals will improve, and they have. As I look at the success of our North America business and industry fundamentals, our challenge continues to be meeting growing demand for our HVA tires. As we've outlined in the short term, we are investing in our factories locally and leveraging our global footprint to deliver more of the tires that our customers want. In fact, we broke ground yesterday in Saint-Louis Mexico for our previously announced new manufacturing plant, which will help satisfy demand and allow us to grow over the long term. 
Shifting to Europe, our EMEA business unit delivered $108 million in segment operating income during the second quarter, down about 8% versus the prior year, which was more than explained by the weak euro. Excluding the impact of currency, EMEA grew 14% year-over-year. EMEA's performance was led by the successful execution of our strategy of growing in targeted market segments, along with the strength in summer tire sales in Western Europe. 
Goodyear branded summer tires, particularly the Goodyear EfficientGrip performance and EfficientGrip SUV tires, claim the top spots in several imported magazine tests, which helped facilitate strong demand and growth in both segments during the summer season. Industry selling for summer tires was strong during the quarter and helped to offset the difficult year-over-year comparisons for winter tire selling. You'll remember that last year, winter tires selling started earlier in the second quarter. As we predicted last quarter, we did not see the same early sell in this year. 
Heading into the second half of the year, we're taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer than usual weather Europe has had over the past 3 years, the higher levels of inventory currently in the channels and a wait-and-see approach by the dealers. Customers may be reluctant to build large inventories of winter tires and selling to retail channels may be delayed. Clearly, the unpredictable winter weather will affect buying patterns, which remains difficult to gauge. Regardless, we're confident our award-winning winter products will position us to win in the marketplace. 
In our commercial segment, our recent share growth has been fueled by our outstanding products and increased demand from fleets. For example, last month, Goodyear was honored with a Luxembourg Green Product Award for its Fuel Max S truck tire. With higher features Intel AmEx groove technology, which was cited as a major breakthrough in the tire industry for fuel efficiency and operating cost production. It is this type of innovation that continues to enhance our value proposition and win with fleets around Europe. Like our success in North America, EMEA's end-to-end fleet service solutions and strong product lineup is driving our year-to-date success and winning new customers. 
Emerging markets in Eastern Europe continue to struggle with an influx of low cost Asian imports. This is a trend we saw in previous quarters and one that we believe will continue in the second half of the year. Given the macroeconomic conditions in Europe, we have and will continue to take actions to better align our cost. In June, we announced the planned closure of our mixing and re-tread operation in Wilbraham in England and some other changes within our EMEA footprint. These actions will help have facilitate a more competitive cost structure. With the economic uncertainties in Europe surrounding currency, the situation in Greece, and the ongoing Russia Ukraine conflict, we believe these are the appropriate and the prudent steps to manage our business. We do not foresee the economic situation improving during the second half of the year and expect the euro to continue to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. 
Through the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on strengthening our value proposition, reducing our cost and winning in our targeted market segments where the value of our brands differentiates us from the competition. 
Latin America continues to be a very volatile region as well. Our business there delivered segment operating income of $43 million, down year-over-year because of the recessionary conditions in Brazil. I'm pleased however, with how our team has executed in these environments. There was double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in many of our Latin America growth markets, including Mexico, Argentina and the Indian countries. However, this performance was more than offset by the weakness in consumer OE, particularly in Brazil, which remains in a recession. New vehicle sales declined 24% in the second quarter and are down 21% year-to-date versus 2014. Venezuela's fluid economic and political situation continues to create challenges and volatility in our Latin America business. However, we are pleased our team has been very successful in continuing to operate profitably in the country while servicing the strong demand for our replacement products. Laura will elaborate on Venezuela in her comments in a moment. 
As I said last quarter, with currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile, but we also remain optimistic about the region's long term prospects. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, strong volume growth in China and India contributed to segment operating income at $84 million and operating margin of more than 17% in the second quarter. In India, our strategy has been a success, as OEM consumer replacement volumes and share both increased, driven by new vehicle launches and strong branded retail performance. 
During the quarter, we launched the Assurance Triple Max tire for the mid-tier passenger segment in India. This is a product that has been very successful in other countries in the region over the past 18 months, and we anticipate it will be in high demand here as well. In China, we continue to have strong year-over-year growth in our consumer replacement and consumer businesses but at a pace slower than anticipated. The slower growth is largely due to a combination of weaker new-car sales, domestic stock market volatility and lagging consumer confidence. While the macroeconomic environment in China is expected to soften relative to the first half, we are driving initiatives to support our growth goals. For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Wal-Mart in China and Goodyear also is now the exclusive tire brand available through Sam's Club stores and online. Going forward, we are focused on driving incremental replacement tire sales in tier 2 and tier 3 series, taking advantage of additional opportunities to grow our customer base. 
As we said in the past, China's growth may not be in a straight line but it's the world's largest auto market. We expect continued growth over the balance of the year but with stronger headwinds than in the first half. We remain confident in our long term growth in China.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy, the focus on our targeted segments and our team's commitment to maximizing value through the integration of our key how-tos. Our 14% segment operating income growth in the first half gives us confidence that we will reach our 10% to 15% growth target display challenges in the global economy. Our commitment to those objectives is unwavering but we will be flexible in how we arrive at our strategic destination of creating sustainable value. 
Many of our markets are considerably more volatile than they were when we developed our plan. We will have additional bumps in the road, but we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year. By running our business for the long term, we won't be distracted by the now familiar fluctuations in the marketplace or the expected headwinds in our industry. Our strategy is solid, it's working, and it delivered in the quarter, as evidenced by 21% year-over-year segment operating income growth and by a 13% operating margin. We believe that it will continue to drive strong results. 
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions. Turning to Slide 7, I would",2104,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 7, I would like to highlight a few items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance showing both volume growth and strong improvement in our segment operating income. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter driven by solid growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in EMEA and Latin America. Looking at our net sales for the quarter, the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced sales by $401 million year-over-year. In addition, other tire-related sales were lower by $81 million. The decline in other tire-related sales was driven by lower third-party chemical sales in North America, reflecting lower commodity costs. Gross margin improved 3.3 points to 27.4%, improving segment operating income to a record $556 million, with a SOI margin of 13.3% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.70. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.84. 
As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the first quarter, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.13, up $0.33 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years. 
The step chart on Slide 8 walks second quarter 2014 segment operating income to second quarter 2015. The positive impact of volume growth and lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs was $8 million. Lower raw material costs of $108 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $7 million, for a net benefit of $101 million during the quarter. While this performance is well ahead of our previous guidance for the second quarter of $25 million to $50 million, about half of the net price/mix versus raw materials in the quarter was a benefit from our Venezuelan operations. Excluding Venezuela, our price/mix and raw material performance came in at the high end of our guidance range. 
Cost saving actions of $101 million more than offset the $71 million impact of inflation, which was driven primarily by Latin America. The highly inflationary environment in Venezuela significantly impacted our net savings in the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have almost doubled. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $35 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 9. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and essentially unchanged versus the prior quarter and the second quarter of last year. This cash balance includes $304 million of cash in Venezuela. Our total debt and our net debt are effectively flat with our first quarter balances as well. Net debt is lower than the second quarter last year by $660 million, following our strong free cash flow performance in 2014. 
Slide 10 shows we generated $377 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Working capital was a source of cash and more than explains the $63 million improvement in free cash flow compared to the prior year. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.1 billion. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America had another great quarter with an all-time record segment operating income of $321 million. This is the 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth and with a segment operating margin of 15.8%, the fifth quarter in a row of earnings exceeding 10% to sales. North America's $113 million year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating our strong value proposition. 
North America's unit volume increase was driven by growth in both OE and the replacement channels. Our commercial truck volume was also strong in the second quarter, driven by strong OE demand for our fuel-efficient tires such as the Fuel Max LHS Sphere and LHD drive tires. Remember, fuel is among the top two largest expenditures for fleets and as such, identifying the most fuel-efficient tire is a critical factor impacting fleet profitability. 
Through the first half of 2015, North America has generated SOI of $519 million, equal to 13% of sales. This earnings power demonstrates the strength of our strategy and overall value proposition. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $108 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 8% over last year's $117 million. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $25 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Our unit volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. And the volume decline was due to 2 factors: First, a continuation of increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe; this area is where we have seen additional pressure driven by an increase in Asian imports. And second, the discontinuation of our farm tire operation last year. Together, these headwinds offset volume increases we saw year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segments in the region. 
As Rich mentioned, strong summer tire sales during the quarter and Western Europe helped to offset the climate we saw in winter tires sell in year-over-year. However, with our previously announced price increases in Europe taking effect in July, we see some of the volume benefit in the quarter as pull ahead of third quarter demand. In commercial truck, we continued to experience a stable industry environment, and we have gained share in replacement based on the strength of our premium-branded products. 
Our EMEA business has delivered solid underlying performance in the first half of 2015. While there will continue to be challenges with foreign currency headwinds, as Rich mentioned, we are very confident in our winner product portfolio and we have taken a cautious approach on volume expectations for the back half of the year, given some summer demand pull ahead and winter inventory remaining in the channels from last year's very warm winter. Even as we plan for a green winter, there is still some risk, due to the unpredictable nature of the weather, and a potential repeat of last year's warm temperatures through the fourth quarter. 
Asia-Pacific generated segment operating income of $84 million in the quarter, an increase of 11% over last year's $76 million. The main contributors to the earnings growth were increased volume and favorable price/mix versus raw material cost, partially offset by higher SAT expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Volume of 6 million units was 5% higher than a year ago and was primarily driven by 2 of our largest and fastest growing markets, with double-digit growth in India and China. 
In China, our volume growth in the quarter was driven by our OE business, where we have been successful in winning new business and gaining share, in addition to participating in the overall industry growth. We are also proud to report that in June, we launched the efficient risk performance tire for Chinese luxury consumers, offering best-in-class, quiet and comfort. As Rich touched on, although China's economic growth has recently moderated from the levels seen in the first half of the year, we are still excited about the long-term growth opportunities we see for our business in Asia. In addition, on Slide 16, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided some further details on our operations in China. In India, we enjoyed double-digit volume growth versus the prior year in both the consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses. 
In Latin America, our volume decreased about 4%. We again saw double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in Mexico, Argentina and the Indian countries. However, this performance was more than offset by weakness in Brazil, especially in the OE and commercial replacement segments, which are feeling the effects of a significant recession. We also saw year-over-year volume declines in Venezuela as we have been operating at lower levels of production than last year. Segment operating income was $43 million for the quarter, $16 million less than the prior year. Latin America benefited from positive price/mix, which is more than offset by the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion cost, as well as lower volume. 
For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $36 million, although the impact of Venezuela on our net income for the quarter was $24 million, which included $12 million of foreign currency exchange losses due to a weakening in Venezuela [indiscernible]. 
While the macroeconomic conditions and currency controls remain challenging, the team has been able to obtain sufficient US dollars to purchase raw materials to support our operations, albeit at a lower than optimal level. I'll discuss our latest thinking as it relates to Venezuela as part of our full year outlook in a moment. Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities, while at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to better match the lower volumes in this recessionary environment. 
Slide 12 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume, overhead absorption, currency and closure-related savings are all unchanged from our April call. We continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, with strength in North America, a cautious view on EMEA's second half volumes, an increasingly challenging environment in Brazil, and lower growth expectations for China. The updates to our outlook are due to Venezuela. The two changes to our 2015 SOI drivers are in the price/mix versus materials and net cost savings outlook line. As we were able to continue profitable operations in Venezuela throughout the first half, and at this time, we have enough visibility to expect access to US dollars for raw material purchases that will enable us to remain at current production levels through the third quarter. As a result, we have updated our outlook to reflect the effect of Venezuela results to the various SOI drivers, rather than including Venezuela as a separate line item. Overall, Venezuela will meaningfully increase our price/mix versus raw material expectations and decrease our net cost savings guidance. Both of these changes are a reflection of the highly inflationary environment in the country. 
Taken together, these changes incorporating Venezuela are a $70 million improvement versus our April outlook. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $330 million for price/mix net of raw material changes. Raw material costs are expected to be 7% lower than last year before cost savings actions due to slight increases in underlying raw material costs since April, particularly for national rubber in the second quarter. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. 
The other significant change in the outlook relate to the net cost savings, where including Venezuela significantly increases the overall inflation headwinds. As a result, we have reduced the net cost savings to approximately $70 million for the year. I want to be clear, this reflects simply the higher inflation related to including Venezuela results throughout the outlook. Our operational excellence programs are on plan and delivering as expected. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 13 and each is consistent with what we provided on our April call. In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces but in total, has increased $70 million, reflecting the operating income improvement from our Venezuela operation. Excluding Venezuela, our full year outlook is unchanged. 
Our strong performance over the first 6 months gives us confidence that we will reach our SOI growth target of 10% to 15% in 2015. In addition, we continue to execute our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization, and including the $50 million in repurchases during the second quarter, we've now repurchased $283 million under our 2014 through 2016 plan. 
Now, we'll open the line up for your questions."

I imagine with the sort of on-again off-again preliminary tariffs in the first half being replaced with now permanent duties in the back half, that pricing independent of raw [indiscernible] could be stronger directionally and then regarding Roz, should these two potentially get better at least in 3Q given your FIFO county and the fact that prices seem to have bottomed about 1.5 quarters prior to 3Q, which I think is roughly consistent with your traditional lag between spot prices and impact to the P&L?"

I guess, first thing is, we don't break out the difference between price/mix, and we're not going to start doing that as we go ahead. But I think as you look at where we're at, obviously, we're very pleased with the results of the business. And I think about, as you think about Q2 and first half and then roll it into second half, I think the first  thing that I would say is, what we're seeing is our goal of creating a business that can deliver sustainable value, sustainable results over the long term. And the decisions that we've taken in the past around our fixed costs, around efficiency, around business choices, around our new product portfolio, around innovation, around putting a focus on the consumer and driving our strategy, those 3 elements of our strategy with the right team, you see that take root and really delivering in this quarter, and I would suggest it's been delivering over the last number of quarters, number of years. So as we think about second half, I think that underlying business model certainly will continue. We also got the benefit now, as you know, we've got lower gas prices, we've got better unemployment, we see miles driven being up, I think 15 reported periods in a row, that means more tread rubbers is being burned on the roads. We see a stronger OE business in the U.S. sort of the 17 million czar [ph] and the work we did on our getting all the right segments is certainly paying dividends as well. So as we look into second half, I think some of that momentum will certainly still be there. As we look at what we said earlier in the year, we said that we would have a strong second half as well in North America. We are also releasing some new tires again part of the Kelly Edge powerline. We have new tires going into Wal-Mart. We have a new insurance tire coming out so certainly, that's going to help our momentum as well, as we move ahead. I'll tell you, we still have, as I mentioned in my remarks, we still have some supply constraints on some of the HVA tires that our customers want and we're still trying to work on that as we get into the second half and beyond getting more tires out of the factories that we have and more out of the import plan that we have as well. So all that momentum I think does carry into the second half as we go. And in terms of where raw materials will be, I would point you back towards the assumption page that Laura can talk to here. We really haven't changed much where we are. I think we said about, what was it 8% reduction for the year."

So there is a a market, I think a favorable market out there in terms of freight and in terms of demand for trucks and consequently, demand for tires. We also have built our business around not just -- and I think this is really the most important thing I can say. It's not just about tires. It's about the whole freight services solutions that we bring. And I think particularly in an environment where there's more trucks on the road, being a full-service fleet provider, meaning new tires retreads and ability to get truckers up and running when they have issues on the road and providing tires and have the fuel economy that really, as Laura mentioned in the remarks, can save trucking companies money on fuel. it's that whole value proposition, I would suggest you, that drives our business results.

We're pursuing those parts of the market where we can create value for ourselves and for our customers. And that's what we're doing. a lot of that bump comes at the low end and exactly as you said, I think you hit it exactly right. With the Kelly Edge, the douglas power line, the kelly power line, with another insurance tire we're putting in, we're taking that HVAC technology, as we've said in one of our megatrends a number of years ago breaking that down into the mid-tier where we can get value for the caddie name and for that Goodyear name as we go ahead. And that was our strategy, it is our strategy and that bump really comes in places that don't -- that doesn't affect us as significantly as the numbers might suggest. And from a Europe perspective, I think when you look at our volume year-over-year, two things to keep in mind.  One, we had a significant sell-in in winter tires in Q2 last year so that made it a tough comp because we didn't see that set in again this year. And also, you're seeing the reduction in our farm business, which I think accounted for about 1/3 of our volume loss in our volume change year-over-year because we're completely out of the farm business now, so that was sort of a one time impact that you see there. So those 2 things really say what volume is. It doesn't have -- would undulated as a significant impact -- sickout concerning as we look to Q2 volumes. And your comment on, obviously, Rod, to just add to that one other quick thing. Winter in Q3 and Q4 is obviously something we're paying very close attention to because of that is a significant item to the industry and to Goodyear. And finally, in terms of our raw materials, the price increase you mentioned that we had in Europe, remember, our raw materials, particularly natural rubber, but other raw materials are dollar-based. So with the weakening euro, our raw material costs are going up, and I think that's the logic of what you see there."

I'll take a step back by saying we have what we feel is an excellent business in China. We've been there a long time since 1994 actually. And our business model there is largely focused in the premium/HVA part of the market. We have low LVA type tires that we make and sell over there, so we have a very good business mix. And we supply that by and large with one of our most technologically advanced and really best performing factories in where we have capacity of about 11 million consumer tires and about half a million truck tires there. So we've been there a long time, we've seen the bumps in the road and we get that. As we look at our business, we still think China will be a growth market over the long term. Today, it's about -- the industry is about a 50-50 split between OE and replacement and remember, that's really different than the rest of the world or our mature markets. As when we describe our company, we say about 30% OE 70% replacement, China is a little bit different as the market matures and as cars get put on the road. So as you think about our business there, is a little bit different mix and obviously, there's a little bit different margin change, 50-50 versus 30 70 in terms of how we think about the rest of the world as well. So that's sort of a picture of our business. Our focus there, Itay, continues to be on growing our branded business and expanding our distribution. We had a very good second quarter, both in OE and a strong quarter in replacement as well. As I mentioned, we are going to continue to focus on growing our business in places like Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, where we're the exclusive buyer and just recently in Sam's Club as well. And we see opportunities beyond sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities we play into Tier 2 and Tier 3 and see a lot of growth opportunities for us there. That's sort of the next phase as we move ahead. So we still feel optimistic about the long term. But listen, all the things that everyone's been following, we've seen a lot of the OEMs take down their forecast on the industry and on growth, and we see the same thing there. So we have -- we saw a growth in the first half. We see that certainly changing in the second half. And be about flat as we look to the year. It's what we see BC there.

We import some from back today and you will be right to think that we're going to think about how we use that capacity in other ways, both in the Asia region as well as possibly in other parts of the world as well.

One, as we look at the economy, there's still a lot of volatility. We said -- I don't know how many, it's probably for a number of years now that we saw sort of Europe continuing to muddle along and we still see that happening with injections into the economy to get it going again. We see the pressure of the euros. We see the Russia Ukraine situation, potentially popping its head up at some points. Certainly I can't prognosticate there. And we saw what happened with Greece, so there's still a lot of volatility going on. And that's always underneath us to think about what has to happen. And frankly, it's why we're focused on our cost structure as well. You may recall we announced a restructuring plan in the U.K. to take out about 400 headcount and close our mixing and region operations there and you will see us focusing on our cost structure, representative of that uncertainty in the markets. So I think that's one thing that remains in our thinking. And secondly, the winter markets are determinative and and what's determinative in the winter markets is the weather. So that will have an impact for us as we look to the second half of the year. And maybe to frame it for you again, I think we're coming off of what 3 warm winters in a row, green or yellow. So what you see is you've got sort of a wait-and-see attitude from dealers who typically don't go along on inventory coming out of a warmer winter. You get some inventory in the channel as it is, and there's just a little uncertainty under there. So we've taken a very measured approach, a balanced approach. We planned for a green winter, not a white winter and we're doing that very consciously to manage our business and manage our factories and manage our inventory. So those things I think are going to coming into play into the back half of the year. So that's really how we think about it, Laura, I don't know if you would anything to add to that."

And as you know, we think about our pricing, not just the price itself, but the value we try to bring to the market. The brand that we bring, which brings customers to dealers stories, the products, the innovation we have, the customer service that we bring, the promotions that we put out in the market, all those things go into how we think about our price versus just a raw material or a cost input. So while I can't speak specifically on price, maybe I can just give you a little bit of flavor of some of the things happening in our regions. And I'll start with EMEA. And really, I'll be a bit repetitive here and say that, I think it was Rod who mentioned that we had a price increase in the second quarter and that really was reflective of the fact that our raw materials are dollar-based and as the euro weakens, it makes our costs go up and I think that's a headwind that we have to deal with as we think about Europe. As we go to Asia, also, there, as raw material prices change, they move quicker through our P&L, as I just mentioned a while ago. So as we see those raw material fluctuations, I would just point out that, that region gets hits quicker and it has  to react quicker and that's what the team does there. And also, remember in places like Australia and India and other places like that, they too have the currency pressure while sourcing materials in US dollars as well. And also, we see a bit in Asia and particularly in China, more of the China-based products staying home versus being exported. Substantially see some of that capacity coming into the market in China as well. But I'd also tell you most of that is on the low end and as I previously mentioned, we particularly play in the premium segment or the HVA segments in China. And in Latin America, I'd say the biggest thing to be aware of there is simply the slower OE production. As I mentioned, new car production was down about 20 -- over 20% so that overcapacity is certainly in the market there and the situation where supply is ahead of demand has an impact. But also, I would say with the reais developing, what's happened is domestic manufacturer certainly, which we are one, have an advantage now, the opposite of what we had before, as a weaker reais means less imports being purchased by our customers there, and that certainly helps us in terms of our market there. And I think our changes in what we've done in places like Brazil in terms of new products and engaging our dealers, all that has resulted in big market share gains for us in Brazil and volume increases in Brazil in 2015. And in North America, I think we will probably cover that with some of the other calls. So that's just maybe some color on what's happening in the markets. And I'll just say, our goal is to continue to capture the value of our brands for our customers and ourselves, and that's what we're focused on."

One, if you go back to when we introduced the megatrends, I mean, we don't go back and talk about those as such. But if you remember, we said that the trend would be the HVA or bigger rim diameter, a more complex constructed tires, better rolling resistance so on and so forth would migrate to the mid-tier and that's exactly what's happening and you see that on new car fitments. So that was, I think, something we knew, we'd call it was going to happen. We saw it happening and it is and it says that mid-tier is a place to be with HVA tires. Secondly, as we look at the market, we had to get our business model aligned to get out of some of the private-label business, which we did, and we moved up market where we could get value for the brands and then we went -- we are and we said we wanted to play in that mid-tier section, particularly mid-tier commuter touring because that is the single largest part of the auto market and the tire market, if you will. So playing in there with the Goodyear-brand in some cases, and the kelly brand in other cases, really sets us up very well to get the value of our brand to put the technology in there and to do that as an alternative for dealers and consumers who, in most cases, would rather have that Kelly or Goodyear Tire than an imported tire. And that was, I think, a strategy we had planned and the strategy we're executing."

I would tell you, and I said this consistently, we're on our plan, we're not going to get thrown off our game because there was a big sell-in ahead, let's say, by a buy head for a tariff coming in where we look like we've lost share on a selling basis.

This morning, I will view highlights from our outstanding second quarter, provide an update on how the macroeconomics in our regions are affecting our business and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions.
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $556 million, a record for any quarter in the company's history and a 21% improvement versus last year. Also, if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, our operating performance improved by 28% in the quarter. These were simply excellent results for our team.
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter results, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $947 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. By comparison, that's higher than our full year segment operating income in 2010. 
In addition, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 13% in the second quarter despite significant foreign currency headwinds and regional macroeconomic challenges. Leading the way, our North American business delivered record segment operating income and nearly a 16% segment operating margin, its highest in my 15 years at Goodyear and likely longer than that. In addition, 3 of our 4 global businesses delivered operating margins of greater than 10% in tougher-than-expected economic environments.
Taken in total, our record second quarter performance reflects the strength and disciplined execution of our strategy. We believe that strength comes largely from the integration of the key how-tos on our strategy road map, innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence supported by an aligned and collaborative team. While each is a significant element in our plan, their value multiplies when they're integrated. Our current results reflect that value, and we've only just begun to tap into its full potential.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for each for the remainder of the year.
North America delivered $321 million of segment operating income, a record for any quarter. This performance was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating the earnings power of our value proposition in a strong market. During the quarter, demand in our replacement business remained solid, and we began to see the benefits of our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. Early demand for these tires has exceeded our expectations as our market-back innovation has allowed us to bring HVA attributes to the mid-tier segments.
Similarly, we've increased our share in OE, which continues to deliver profitable results by selling the HVA products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and the Assurance Fuel Max on some of the most popular vehicles in line with our strategy. The results are paying dividends not only in our OE performance, but also in the Goodyear brand replacement pull-through as consumers visit our aligned dealers. The enhancements to our product mix have been an important enabler of North America's improved value proposition. 
During the first half, we also began to roll out our new e-commerce platform for consumer replacement tires. We developed our online sales strategy to reduce friction or, in other words, to make the tire buying process easier for consumers. The program is still in the early stages, but it has met or exceeded our initial expectations while providing many key learnings needed to implement it successfully over the long term as consumers change their buying habits. We remain confident that this program, with our industry-leading dealer network and more than 4,000 locations enrolled to date, will drive profitability through the value chain.
Our commercial truck tire business also had a strong second quarter based on the robust demand for our industry-leading products. In June, we unveiled a new commercial tire product, the Endurance WHA for waste haul fleets, which will be available later this year. Our total portfolio of commercial truck tire offerings has never been better. And combined with our fleet service model, that's the gold standard of the industry, that makes Goodyear the clear leader -- a clear industry leader in the commercial truck business.
Across all of our segments in North America, our value proposition has allowed us to excel in a market where drivers of demand have remained very strong. New passenger vehicle sales are at the highest in a decade. Miles driven for the first 5 months of the year was at an all-time record, and we project miles driven for the full year to be a record as well. And year-to-date truck tonnage has increased 3% over the same period last year. All are leading indicators for good tire markets, and we believe the underlying fundamentals will remain favorable for some time.
We have consistently said that it was a question of when, not if, industry fundamentals would improve, and they have. As I look at the success of our North American business and the industry fundamentals, our challenge continues to be meeting growing demand for our HVA tires. As we've outlined, in the short term, we are investing in our factories locally and leveraging our global footprints to deliver more of the tires that our customers want. In fact, we broke ground yesterday in San Luis Potosí, Mexico for our previously announced new manufacturing plant which will help satisfy demand and allow us to grow over the long term.
Shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered $108 million in segment operating income during the second quarter, down about 8% versus the prior year, which was more than explained by the weak euro. Excluding the impact of currency, EMEA grew 14% year-over-year. EMEA's performance was led by the successful execution of our strategy of growing in targeted market segments, along with the strength in summer tire sales in Western Europe.
Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly the Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and EfficientGrip SUV tires, claimed the top spots in several important magazine tests, which helped facilitate strong demand and growth in those segments during the summer season. Industry sell-in for summer tires was strong during the quarter and helped to offset the difficult year-over-year comparisons for winter tire sell-in. You'll remember that last year, winter tire sell-in started earlier in the second quarter. As we predicted last quarter, we did not see the same early sell-in this year.
Heading into the second half of the year, we're taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer-than-usual weather Europe has had over the past 3 years, the higher levels of inventory currently in the channels and a wait-and-see approach by the dealers. Customers may be reluctant to build large inventories of winter tires, and selling to retail channels may be delayed. Clearly, the unpredictable winter weather will affect buying patterns which remain difficult to gauge. Regardless, we're confident our award-winning winter products will position us to win in the marketplace.
In our commercial segment, our recent share growth has been fueled by our outstanding products and increased demand from fleets. For example, last month, Goodyear was honored with a Luxembourg Green Product Award for its FUELMAX S truck tire. The tire features IntelliMax Groove Technology, which was cited as a major breakthrough in the tire industry for fuel efficiency and operating cost reduction. It is this type of innovation that continues to enhance our value proposition and win with fleets around Europe. Like our success in North America, EMEA's end-to-end fleet service solutions and strong product lineup is driving our year-to-date success and winning new customers.
Emerging markets in Eastern Europe continue to struggle with an influx of low-cost Asian imports. This is a trend we saw in previous quarters and one that we believe will continue in the second half of the year. Given the macroeconomic conditions in Europe, we have and will continue to take actions to better align our cost. In June, we announced the planned closure of our mixing and retread operation in Wolverhampton, England and some other changes within our EMEA footprint. These actions will help facilitate a more competitive cost structure.
With the economic uncertainties in Europe surrounding currency, the situation in Greece and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we believe these are the appropriate and the prudent steps to manage our business. We do not foresee the economic situation improving during the second half of the year and expect the euro to continue to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar.
Through the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on strengthening our value proposition, reducing our cost and winning in our targeted market segments where the value of our brands differentiates us from the competition.
Latin America continues to be a very volatile region as well. Our business there delivered segment operating income of $43 million, down year-over-year because of the recessionary conditions in Brazil. I'm pleased, however, with how our team has executed in this environment. There was double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in many of our Latin America growth markets, including Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by the weakness in consumer OE, particularly in Brazil, which remains in a recession. New vehicle sales declined 24% in the second quarter and are down 21% year-to-date versus 2014. Venezuela's fluid economic and political situation continues to create challenges and volatility in our Latin America business. However, we are pleased our team has been very successful in continuing to operate profitably in the country while servicing the strong demand for our replacement products. Laura will elaborate on Venezuela in her comments in a moment.
As I said last quarter, with currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile, but we also remain optimistic about the region's long-term prospects.
Finally, in Asia-Pacific, strong volume growth in China and India contributed to segment operating income at $84 million and operating margin of more than 17% in the second quarter. In India, our strategy has been a success as OE and consumer replacement volumes and share both increased, driven by new vehicle launches and strong branded retail performance.
During the quarter, we launched the Assurance TripleMax tire for the mid-tier passenger segment in India. This is a product that has been very successful in other countries in the region over the past 18 months, and we anticipate it will be in high demand here as well.
In China, we continue to have strong year-over-year growth in our consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses but at a pace slower than anticipated. The slower growth is largely due to a combination of weaker new car sales, domestic stock market volatility and lagging consumer confidence. While the macroeconomic environment in China is expected to soften relative to the first half, we are driving initiatives to support our growth goals. For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Walmart in China, and Goodyear also is now the exclusive tire brand available through Sam's Club stores and online. Going forward, we are focused on driving incremental replacement tire sales in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, taking advantage of additional opportunities to grow our customer base.
As we said in the past, China's growth may not be in a straight line, but it's the world's largest auto market. We expect continued growth over the balance of the year but with stronger headwinds than in the first half. We remain confident in our long-term growth in China.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy, the focus on our targeted segments and our team's commitment to maximizing value through the integration of our key how-tos. Our 14% segment operating income growth in the first half gives us confidence that we will reach our 10% to 15% growth target despite challenges in the global economy. Our commitment to those objectives is unwavering, but we will be flexible in how we arrive at our strategic destination of creating sustainable value.
Many of our markets are considerably more volatile than they were when we developed our plan. We will have additional bumps in the road, but we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year. By running our business for the long term, we won't be distracted by the now familiar fluctuations in the marketplace or the expected headwinds in our industry. Our strategy is solid, it's working, and it delivered in the quarter as evidenced by 21% year-over-year segment operating income growth and by a 13% operating margin. We believe it will continue to drive strong results.
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results, and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.Turning to Slide 7, I would",2099,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results, and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to Slide 7, I would like to highlight a few items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance showing both volume growth and strong improvement in our segment operating income. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in EMEA and Latin America.
Looking at our net sales for the quarter. The impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced sales by $401 million year-over-year. In addition, other tire-related sales were lower by $81 million. The decline in other tire-related sales was driven by lower third-party chemical sales in North America, reflecting lower commodity costs. Gross margin improved 3.3 points to 27.4%, improving segment operating income to a record $556 million with an SOI margin of 13.3% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.70. Our results were influenced by certain significant items which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.84.
As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the first quarter, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.13, up $0.33 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years.
The step chart on Slide 8 walks second quarter 2014 segment operating income to second quarter 2015. The positive impact of volume growth and lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs was $8 million. Lower raw material cost of $108 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $7 million for a net benefit of $101 million during the quarter. While this performance is well ahead of our previous guidance for the second quarter of $25 million to $50 million, about half of the net price/mix versus raw materials in the quarter was a benefit from our Venezuelan operation. Excluding Venezuela, our price/mix and raw material performance came in at the high end of our guidance range.
Cost-saving actions of $101 million more than offset the $71 million impact of inflation, which was driven primarily by Latin America. The highly inflationary environment in Venezuela significantly impacted our net savings in the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have almost doubled. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $35 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the euro.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 9. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and essentially unchanged versus the prior quarter and the second quarter of last year. This cash balance includes $304 million of cash in Venezuela. Our total debt and our net debt are effectively flat with our first quarter balances as well. Net debt is lower than the second quarter last year by $660 million, following our strong free cash flow performance in 2014.
Slide 10 shows we generated $377 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Working capital was a source of cash and more than explains the $63 million improvement in free cash flow compared to the prior year. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.1 billion.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America had another great quarter with an all-time record segment operating income of $321 million. This is the 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, and with a segment operating margin of 15.8%, the fifth quarter in a row of earnings exceeding 10% to sales. North America's $113 million year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating our strong value proposition.
North America's unit volume increase was driven by growth in both OE and the replacement channels. Our commercial truck volume was also strong in the second quarter, driven by strong OE demand for our fuel-efficient tires, such as the Fuel Max LHS steer and LHD drive tires. Remember, fuel is among the top 2 largest expenditures for fleets. And as such, identifying the most fuel-efficient tire is a critical factor impacting fleet profitability.
Through the first half of 2015, North America has generated SOI of $519 million, equal to 13% of sales. This earnings power demonstrates the strength of our strategy and overall value proposition.
Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $108 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 8% over last year's $117 million. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $25 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Our unit volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. And the volume decline was due to 2 factors. First, a continuation of increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This area is where we have seen additional pressure driven by an increase in Asian imports. And second, the discontinuation of our farm tire operation last year. Together, these headwinds offset volume increases we saw year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segments in the region.
As Rich mentioned, strong summer tire sales during the quarter in Western Europe helped offset declines we saw in winter tire sell-in year-over-year. However, with our previously announced price increases in Europe taking effect in July, we see some of the volume benefit in the quarter as pull-ahead of third quarter demand. In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment, and we have gained share in replacement based on the strength of our premium-branded products.
Our EMEA business has delivered solid underlying performance in the first half of 2015. While there will continue to be challenges with foreign currency headwinds, as Rich mentioned, we are very confident in our winter product portfolio, and we have taken a cautious approach on volume expectations for the back half of the year given some summer demand pull-ahead and winter inventory remaining in the channels from last year's very warm winter. Even as we plan for a green winter, there is still some risk due to the unpredictable nature of the weather and a potential repeat of last year's warm temperatures through the fourth quarter.
Asia-Pacific generated segment operating income of $84 million in the quarter, an increase of 11% over last year's $76 million. The main contributors to the earnings growth were increased volume and favorable price/mix versus raw material cost, partially offset by higher SAG expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Volume of 6 million units was 5% higher than a year ago and was primarily driven by 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets, with double-digit growth in India and China.
In China, our volume growth in the quarter was driven by our OE business, where we have been successful in winning new business and gaining share, in addition to participating in the overall industry growth. We are also proud to report that in June, we launched the EfficientGrip Performance tire for Chinese luxury consumers, offering best-in-class, quiet and comfort. As Rich touched on, although China's economic growth has recently moderated from the levels seen in the first half of the year, we are still excited about the long-term growth opportunities we see for our business in Asia. In addition, on Slide 16, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided some further details on our operations in China. In India, we enjoyed double-digit volume growth versus the prior year in both the consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses.
In Latin America, our volume decreased about 4%. We again saw double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by weakness in Brazil, especially in the OE and commercial replacement segments, which are feeling the effects of a significant recession. We also saw year-over-year volume declines in Venezuela as we have been operating at lower levels of production than last year. Segment operating income was $43 million for the quarter, $16 million less than the prior year. Latin America benefited from positive price/mix, which is more than offset by the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs as well as lower volume.
For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $36 million, although the impact of Venezuela on our net income for the quarter was $24 million, which included $12 million of foreign currency exchange losses due to a weakening in Venezuela's FICO [ph] grade.
While the macroeconomic conditions and currency controls remain challenging, the team has been able to obtain sufficient US dollars to purchase raw materials to support our operations, albeit at a lower-than-optimal level. I'll discuss our latest thinking as it relates to Venezuela as part of our full year outlook in a moment.
Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities while, at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to better match the lower volumes in this recessionary environment.
Slide 12 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume, overhead absorption, currency and Amiens' closure-related savings are all unchanged from our April call. We continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, with strength in North America, a cautious view on EMEA's second half volumes, an increasingly challenging environment in Brazil and lower growth expectations for China. The updates to our outlook are due to Venezuela. The 2 changes to our 2015 SOI drivers are in the price/mix versus raw materials and net cost savings outlook line. As we were able to continue profitable operations in Venezuela throughout the first half, and at this time, we have enough visibility to expect access to U.S. dollars for raw material purchases that will enable us to remain at current production levels through the third quarter. As a result, we have updated our outlook to reflect the effect of Venezuela results to the various SOI drivers rather than including Venezuela as a separate line item. Overall, Venezuela will meaningfully increase our price/mix versus raw material expectations and decrease our net cost savings guidance. Both of these changes are a reflection of the highly inflationary environment in the country.
Taken together, these changes incorporating Venezuela are a $70 million improvement versus our April outlook. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $330 million for price/mix net of raw material changes. Raw material costs are expected to be 7% lower than last year before cost savings actions due to slight increases in the underlying raw material costs since April, particularly for natural rubber in the second quarter. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.
The other significant change in the outlook relates to the net cost savings, where including Venezuela, significantly increases the overall inflation headwind. As a result, we have reduced the net cost savings to approximately $70 million for the year. I want to be clear: This reflects simply the higher inflation related to including Venezuela results throughout the outlook. Our operational excellence programs are on plan and delivering as expected.
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 13, and each is consistent with what we provided on our April call. In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces but, in total, has increased $70 million, reflecting the operating income improvement from our Venezuela operation. Excluding Venezuela, our full year outlook is unchanged.
Our strong performance over the first 6 months gives us confidence that we will reach our SOI growth target of 10% to 15% in 2015. In addition, we continue to execute our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. And including the $50 million in repurchases during the second quarter, we've now repurchased $283 million under our 2014 through 2016 plan.

And then regarding raws, should these 2 potentially get better at least in 3Q, given your FIFO accounting and the fact that prices seem to have bottomed about 1.5 quarters prior to 3Q, which I think is roughly consistent with your traditional lag between spot prices and impact to the P&L?"

I guess, first thing is, we don't break out the difference between price/mix, and we're not going to start doing that as we go ahead. But I think as you look at where we're at, obviously, we're very pleased with the results of the business. And I think about -- as you think about Q2 and first half and then roll it into second half, I think the first  thing that I would say is, what we're seeing is our goal of creating a business that can deliver sustainable value, sustainable results over the long term. And the decisions that we've taken in the past around our fixed costs, around efficiency, around business choices, around our new product portfolio, around innovation, around putting a focus on the consumer and driving our strategy, those 3 elements of our strategy with the right team, you're seeing that take root and really delivering in this quarter. And I would suggest it's been delivering over the last number of quarters, number of years. So as we think about second half, I think that underlying business model certainly will continue. We also got the benefit now. As you know, we've got lower gas prices. We've got better unemployment. We see miles driven being up, I think, 15 reported periods in a row. That means more tread rubber is being burned on the roads. We see a stronger OE business in the U.S. sort of the $17 million SAR. And the work we did on our -- getting on the right fitments is certainly paying dividends as well. So as we look into second half, I think some of that momentum will certainly still be there. As we look at what we said earlier in the year, we said that we would have a strong second half as well in North America. We're also releasing some new tires again, part of the Kelly Edge power line. We have new tires going into Walmart. We have a new Assurance tire coming out. So certainly, that's going to help our momentum as well as we move ahead. I'll tell you, we still have -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we still have some supply constraints on some of the HVA tires that our customers want, and we're still trying to work on that as we get into the second half and beyond, getting more tires out of the factories that we have and more out of the import plan that we have as well. So all that momentum, I think, does carry into the second half as we go. And in terms of where raw materials will be, I would point you back toward the assumption page that Laura can talk to here. We really haven't changed much where we are. I think we said about, what was it, an 8% reduction for the year."

I mean, I know our U.S. economy is not hitting on all cylinders, but it's certainly improved. And I think there's certainly some pent-up demand out there that's going over the roads. In addition, the OE business is very strong as well. As truck builds, I know you see guys do where your colleagues follow the trucking industry, you know what the boards look like in terms of new truck builds. So there is a market, I think a favorable market out there in terms of freight and in terms of demand for trucks, and consequently, demand for tires. We also have built our business around not just -- and I think this is really the most important thing I can say. It's not just about tires; it's about the whole freight services solutions that we bring. And I think particularly in an environment where there's more trucks on the road, being a full-service fleet provider -- meaning, new tires, retreads and ability to get truckers up and running when they have issues on the road and providing truck tires and have the fuel economy that really, as Laura mentioned in the remarks, can save trucking companies money on fuel, it's that whole value proposition, I would suggest here, that drives our business results. And that's important because that model will also be beneficial to us when the industry is not a strong as it is right now. So that really is, I would tell you, the underlying strength that we have. And I would say very proudly, I think we have the best business model in North America by far."

As I've",427,"So Rod, from a North American perspective, I think the market's up because you had non-Chinese imports come in mostly at the low end of the market again. And that's not, as you know, a place where we play. So that's really what drove that market. As I've said in the past, we're sticking to our strategy. We're not just pursuing volume for volume's sake. We're pursuing those parts of the market where we can create value for ourselves and for our customers. And that's what we're doing. A lot of that bump comes at the low end. And exactly as you said, I think you hit it exactly right. With the Kelly Edge, with the Douglas power line, the Kelly power line, with another Assurance tire we're putting in, we're taking that HVA technology, as we said, in one of our megatrends a number of years ago, bringing that down into the mid-tier where we can get value for the Kelly name and for that Goodyear name as we move ahead. And that was our strategy, it is our strategy, and that bump really comes in places that don't -- that doesn't affect us as significantly as the numbers might suggest. And from a Europe perspective, I think when you look at our volume year-over-year, 2 things to keep in mind: one, we had a significant sell-in in winter tires in Q2 last year, so that made it a tough comp because we didn't see that sell-in again this year; and also, you're seeing the reduction in our farm business, which I think accounted for about 1/3 of our volume loss in our volume change year-over-year because we're completely out of the farm business now, so that was sort of a onetime impact that you see there. So those 2 things really say what volume is. It doesn't have a -- we don't view it as a significant impact -- a significant concern as we look at Q2 volumes. And your comment on -- obviously, Rod, maybe just to add to that one other quick thing. Winter in Q3 and Q4 is obviously something we're paying very close attention to because that is a significant item to the industry and to Goodyear. And finally, in terms of our raw materials, the price increase you mentioned that we had in Europe, remember, our raw materials, particularly natural rubber but other raw materials, are dollar-based. So with the weakening euro, our raw material costs are going up. And I think that's the logic of what you're seeing there."

I'll take a step back by saying we have what we feel is an excellent business in China. We've been there a long time since 1994 actually, and our business model there is largely focused in the premium/HVA part of the market. We have low LVA-type tires that we make and sell over there. So we have a very good business mix. And we supply that, by and large, with one of our most technologically advanced and really best-performing factories in Pulandian and where we have capacity of about 11 million consumer tires and about 0.5 million truck tires there. So we've been there a long time, we've seen the bumps in the road, and we get that. As we look at our business, we still think China will be a growth market over the long term. Today, it's about -- the industry is about a 50-50 split between OE and replacement. And remember, that's really different than the rest of the world or our mature markets. As we -- when we describe our company, we say about 30% OE, 70% replacement, China is a little bit different as that market matures and as cars get put on the road. So as you think about our business there, it's a little bit different mix, and obviously, there's a little bit different margin change, 50-50 versus 30-70, in terms of how we think about the rest of the world as well. So that's sort of a picture of our business. Our focus there, Itay, continues to be on growing our branded business and expanding our distribution. We had a very good second quarter both in OE and a strong quarter in replacement as well. As I mentioned, we are going to continue to focus on growing our business in places like Walmart and Sam's Club, where we're the exclusive tire -- and just recently, in Sam's Club as well. And we see opportunities beyond sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities. We play into Tier 2 and Tier 3 and see a lot of growth opportunities for us there. That's sort of the next phase as we move ahead. So we still feel very optimistic about the long term. But listen, the -- all the things that everyone's been following, we've seen a lot of the OEMs take down their forecast on the industry and on growth, and we see the same thing there. So we have -- we saw growth in the first half, and we see that certainly changing in the second half and be about flat as we look to the year. It's what we see there. So we'll have some headwinds there, but we also have a plant, as I said, that has high technology. We import some from that today, and you would be right to think that we're going to think about how we use that capacity in other ways, both in the Asia region as well as possibly in other parts of the world as well. So a clear bump in the road, a clear headwind that we have to deal with. And I'll just say, we can and we will, and we're going to remain very -- we do remain very optimistic about our prospects in China over the long term."

And you'll see us focusing on our cost structure, representative of that uncertainty in the markets. So I think that's one thing that remains in our thinking. And secondly, the winter markets are determinative. And what's determinative in the winter markets is the weather. So that will have an impact for us as we look to the second half of the year. And maybe to frame it for you again, I think we're coming off of, what, 3 warm winters in a row, green or yellow. So what you see is you've got sort of a wait-and-see attitude from dealers who typically don't go long on inventory. Coming out of a warmer winter, you've got some inventory in the channel as it is, and there's just a little uncertainty under there. So we have taken a very measured approach, a balanced approach. We planned for a ""green winter,"" not a white winter, and we're doing that very consciously to manage our business and manage our factories and manage our inventory. So those things, I think, are going to come into play into the back half of the year. So that's really how we think about it. Laura, I don't know if you'd add anything to that."

And as you know, we think about our pricing, not just the price itself, but the value we try to bring to the market. The brand that we bring, which brings customers to dealer stores, the products, the innovation we have in them, the customer service that we bring, the promotions that we put out in the market, all those things go into how we think about our price versus just a raw material or a cost input. So while I can't speak specifically on price, maybe I can just give you a little bit of flavor of some of the things happening in our regions. And I'll start with EMEA. And really, I'll be a bit repetitive here and say, I think it was Rod who mentioned, that we had a price increase in the second quarter. And that really was reflective of the fact that our raw materials are dollar-based. And as the euro weakens, it makes our costs go up. And I think that's a headwind that we have to deal with as we think about Europe. As we go to Asia, also there, as raw material prices change, they move quicker through our P&L, as I just mentioned a while ago. So as we see those raw material fluctuations, I would just point out that, that region gets hits quicker, and it has to react quicker. And that's what that team does there. And also, remember in places like Australia and India and other places like that, they, too, have the currency pressure while sourcing materials in U.S. dollars as well. And also, we see a bit in Asia and particularly in China. More of the China-based products staying home versus being exported. So we see some of that capacity coming into the market in China as well. But I'd also tell you, most of that is on the low end. And as I previously mentioned, we particularly play in the premium segments or the HVA segments in China. And in Latin America, I'd say the biggest thing to be aware of there is simply the slower OE production. As I mentioned, new car production was down about 20% -- over 20%, so that overcapacity is certainly in the market there, and any situation where supply is ahead of demand has an impact. But also, I would say, with the real devaluing, what's happened is domestic manufacturers certainly, of which we are one, have an advantage now, the opposite of what we had before, as a weaker real means less imports being purchased by our customers there. And that certainly helps us in terms of our market there. And I think our changes in what we've done in places like Brazil in terms of new products and engaging our dealers, all that has resulted in big market share gains for us in Brazil and volume increases in Brazil in 2015. And in North America, I think we probably covered that with some of the other calls. So that's just maybe some color on what's happening in the markets. And I'll just say, our goal is to continue to capture the value of our brands for our customers and ourselves. And that's what we're focused on."

How do we think about your increased emphasis, let's say, on the Kelly brand relative to your longstanding strategy of kind of moving towards higher value-added, higher-margin tires and so forth?

One, if you go back to when we introduced the megatrends, I mean, we don't go back and talk about those as such. But if you remember, we said that the trend would be the HVA or bigger rim diameter, a more complex constructed tires, better rolling resistance, so on and so forth, would migrate to the mid-tier. And that's exactly what's happening, and you see that on new car fitments. So that was, I think, something we knew we call that was going to happen. We saw it happening, and it is, and it says that mid-tier is a place to be with HVA tires. Secondly, as we look at the market, we had to get our business model aligned to get out of some of the private label business, which we did, and we moved up market where we could get value for the brands. And then we want to -- we are, and we said we wanted to play in that mid-tier section, particularly mid-tier commuter touring because that is the single largest part of the auto market and the tire market, if you will. So playing in there with the Goodyear brand, in some cases, and the Kelly brand, in other cases, really sets us up very well to get the value of our brand, to put the technology in there and to do that as an alternative for dealers and consumers who, in most cases, would rather have that Kelly or Goodyear tire than an imported tire. And that was, I think, a strategy we had planned and the strategy we're executing."

I think from a sell-in standpoint, the numbers are muted and have been on a comparative basis as you've had big buy-aheads and then big periods of buy-aheads and then big periods of not buying. And that can kind of make the sell-in numbers, which those share numbers are based on, a little bit more difficult to read. I would tell you, and I've said this consistently, we're on our plan. We're not going to get thrown off our game because there was a big sell-in ahead, let's say, by a buy-ahead for a tariff coming in where we look like we've lost share on a sell-in basis, and then have it reversed the next quarter where we look like we're up because dealers have stopped buying those imported tires because of the tariffs.

This morning, I will review highlights from our outstanding second quarter, provide an update on how the macroeconomics in our regions are affecting our business and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions.
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $556 million, a record for any quarter in the company's history and a 21% improvement versus last year. Also, if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, our operating performance improved by 28% in the quarter. These were simply excellent results for our team.
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter results, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $947 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. By comparison, that's higher than our full year segment operating income in 2010. 
In addition, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 13% in the second quarter despite significant foreign currency headwinds and regional macro-economic challenges. Leading the way, our North American business delivered record segment operating income and nearly a 16% segment operating margin, its highest in my 15 years at Goodyear and likely longer than that. In addition, 3 of our 4 global businesses delivered operating margins of greater than 10% in tougher-than-expected economic environments.
Taken in total, our record second quarter performance reflects the strength and disciplined execution of our strategy. We believe that strength comes largely from the integration of the key how-tos on our strategy road map: innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence supported by an aligned and collaborative team. While each is a significant element in our plan, their value multiplies when they're integrated. Our current results reflect that value, and we've only just begun to tap into its full potential.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for each for the remainder of the year.
North America delivered $321 million of segment operating income, a record for any quarter. This performance was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating the earnings power of our value proposition in a strong market. During the quarter, demand in our replacement business remained solid, and we began to see the benefits of our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. Early demand for these tires has exceeded our expectations as our market-backed innovation has allowed us to bring HVA attributes to the mid-tier segments.
Similarly, we've increased our share in OE, which continues to deliver profitable results by selling HVA products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and the Assurance Fuel Max on some of the most popular vehicles, in line with our strategy. The results are paying dividends not only in our OE performance, but also in the Goodyear brand replacement pull-through as consumers visit our aligned dealers. The enhancements to our product mix have been an important enabler of North America's improved value proposition. 
Now during the first half, we also began to roll out our new e-commerce platform for consumer replacement tires. We developed our online sales strategy to reduce friction or, in other words, to make the tire buying process easier for consumers. The program is still in the early stages, but it has met or exceeded our initial expectations while providing many key learnings needed to implement it successfully over the long term as consumers change their buying habits. We remain confident that this program, with our industry-leading dealer network and more than 4,000 locations enrolled to date, will drive profitability through the value chain.
Our commercial truck tire business also had a strong second quarter based on the robust demand for our industry-leading products. In June, we unveiled a new commercial tire product, the Endurance WHA for waste haul fleets, which will be available later this year. Our total portfolio of commercial truck tire offerings has never been better. And combined with our fleet service model that's the gold standard of the industry, that makes Goodyear the clear leader -- a clear industry leader in the commercial truck business.
Across all of our segments in North America, our value proposition has allowed us to excel in a market where drivers of demand have remained very strong. New passenger vehicle sales are at the highest in a decade. Miles driven for the first 5 months of the year was at an all-time record, and we project miles driven for the full year to be a record as well. And year-to-date truck tonnage has increased 3% over the same period last year. All are leading indicators for good tire markets, and we believe the underlying fundamentals will remain favorable for some time.
We've consistently said that it was a question of when, not if, industry fundamentals would improve, and they have. As I look at the success of our North American business and the industry fundamentals, our challenge continues to be meeting growing demand for our HVA tires. As we've outlined, in the short term, we are investing in our factories locally and leveraging our global footprints to deliver more of the tires that our customers want. In fact, we broke ground yesterday in San Luis Potosí, Mexico for our previously announced new manufacturing plant which will help satisfy demand and allow us to grow over the long term.
Shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered $108 million in segment operating income during the second quarter, down about 8% versus the prior year, which was more than explained by the weak euro. Excluding the impact of currency, EMEA grew 14% year-over-year. EMEA's performance was led by the successful execution of our strategy of growing in targeted market segments, along with the strength in summer tire sales in Western Europe.
Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly the Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and EfficientGrip SUV tires, claimed the top spots in several important magazine tests, which helped facilitate strong demand and growth in those segments during the summer season. Industry sell-in for summer tires was strong during the quarter and helped to offset the difficult year-over-year comparisons for winter tire sell-in. You'll remember that last year, winter tire sell-in started earlier in the second quarter. As we predicted last quarter, we did not see the same early sell-in this year.
Heading into the second half of the year, we're taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer-than-usual weather Europe has had over the past 3 years, the higher levels of inventory currently in the channels and a wait-and-see approach by the dealers. Customers may be reluctant to build large inventories of winter tires, and sell-in to retail channels may be delayed. Clearly, the unpredictable winter weather will affect buying patterns, which remain difficult to gauge. Regardless, we're confident our award-winning winter products will position us to win in the marketplace.
In our commercial segment, our recent share growth has been fueled by our outstanding products and increased demand from fleets. For example, last month, Goodyear was honored with a Luxembourg Green Product Award for its FUELMAX S truck tire. The tire features IntelliMax Groove Technology, which was cited as a major breakthrough in the tire industry for fuel efficiency and operating cost reduction. It is this type of innovation that continues to enhance our value proposition and win with fleets around Europe. Like our success in North America, EMEA's end-to-end fleet service solutions and strong product lineup is driving our year-to-date success and winning new customers.
Emerging markets in Eastern Europe continue to struggle with an influx of low-cost Asian imports. This is a trend we saw in previous quarters and one that we believe will continue in the second half of the year. Given the macro-economic conditions in Europe, we have and will continue to take actions to better align our cost. In June, we announced the planned closure of our mixing and retread operation in Wolverhampton, England and some other changes within our EMEA footprint. These actions will help facilitate a more competitive cost structure.
With the economic uncertainties in Europe surrounding currency, the situation in Greece and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we believe these are the appropriate and the prudent steps to manage our business. We do not foresee the economic situation improving during the second half of the year and expect the euro to continue to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar.
Through the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on strengthening our value proposition, reducing our costs and winning in our targeted market segments where the value of our brands differentiates us from the competition.
Latin America continues to be a very volatile region as well. Our business there delivered segment operating income of $43 million, down year-over-year because of the recessionary conditions in Brazil. I'm pleased, however, with how our team has executed in this environment. There was double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in many of our Latin America growth markets, including Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by the weakness in consumer OE, particularly in Brazil, which remains in a recession. New vehicle sales declined 24% in the second quarter and are down 21% year-to-date versus 2014. Venezuela's fluid economic and political situation continues to create challenges and volatility in our Latin America business. However, we are pleased our team has been very successful in continuing to operate profitably in the country while servicing the strong demand for our replacement products. Laura will elaborate on Venezuela in her comments in a moment.
As I said last quarter, with currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile, but we also remain optimistic about the region's long-term prospects.
Finally, in Asia-Pacific, strong volume growth in China and India contributed to segment operating income at $84 million and operating margin of more than 17% in the second quarter. In India, our strategy has been a success as OE and consumer replacement volumes and share both increased, driven by new vehicle launches and strong branded retail performance.
During the quarter, we launched the Assurance TripleMax tire for the mid-tier passenger segment in India. This is a product that has been very successful in other countries in the region over the past 18 months, and we anticipate it will be in high demand here as well.
In China, we continue to have strong year-over-year growth in our consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses but at a pace slower than anticipated. The slower growth is largely due to a combination of weaker new car sales, domestic stock market volatility and lagging consumer confidence. While the macro-economic environment in China is expected to soften relative to the first half, we are driving initiatives to support our growth goals. For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Walmart in China, and Goodyear also is now the exclusive tire brand available through Sam's Club stores and online. Going forward, we are focused on driving incremental replacement tire sales in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, taking advantage of additional opportunities to grow our customer base.
As we said in the past, China's growth may not be in a straight line, but it's the world's largest auto market. We expect continued growth over the balance of the year but with stronger headwinds than in the first half. We remain confident in our long-term growth in China.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy, the focus on our targeted segments and our team's commitment to maximizing value through the integration of our key how-tos. Our 14% segment operating income growth in the first half gives us confidence that we will reach our 10% to 15% growth target despite challenges in the global economy. Our commitment to those objectives is unwavering, but we will be flexible in how we arrive at our strategic destination of creating sustainable value.
Many of our markets are considerably more volatile than they were when we developed our plan. We will have additional bumps in the road, but we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year. By running our business for the long term, we won't be distracted by the now familiar fluctuations in the marketplace or the expected headwinds in our industry. Our strategy is solid, it's working, and it delivered in the quarter as evidenced by 21% year-over-year segment operating income growth and by a 13% operating margin. We believe it will continue to drive strong results.
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results, and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.Turning to Slide 7, I would",2097,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results, and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to Slide 7, I would like to highlight a few items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance showing both volume growth and strong improvement in our segment operating income. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in EMEA and Latin America.
Looking at our net sales for the quarter. The impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced sales by $401 million year-over-year. In addition, other tire-related sales were lower by $81 million. The decline in other tire-related sales was driven by lower third-party chemical sales in North America, reflecting lower commodity costs. Gross margin improved 3.3 points to 27.4%, improving segment operating income to a record $556 million with an SOI margin of 13.3% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.70. Our results were influenced by certain significant items which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.84.
As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the first quarter, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.13, up $0.33 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years.
The step chart on Slide 8 walks second quarter 2014 segment operating income to second quarter 2015. The positive impact of volume growth and lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs was $8 million. Lower raw material cost of $108 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $7 million for a net benefit of $101 million during the quarter. While this performance is well ahead of our previous guidance for the second quarter of $25 million to $50 million, about half of the net price/mix versus raw materials in the quarter was a benefit from our Venezuelan operations. Excluding Venezuela, our price/mix and raw material performance came in at the high end of our guidance range.
Cost-saving actions of $101 million more than offset the $71 million impact of inflation, which was driven primarily by Latin America. The highly inflationary environment in Venezuela significantly impacted our net savings in the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have almost doubled. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $35 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 9. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and essentially unchanged versus the prior quarter and the second quarter of last year. This cash balance includes $304 million of cash in Venezuela. Our total debt and our net debt are effectively flat with our first quarter balances as well. Net debt is lower than the second quarter last year by $660 million, following our strong free cash flow performance in 2014.
Slide 10 shows we generated $377 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Working capital was a source of cash and more than explains the $63 million improvement in free cash flow compared to the prior year. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.1 billion.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America had another great quarter with an all-time record segment operating income of $321 million. This is the 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, and with a segment operating margin of 15.8%, the fifth quarter in a row of earnings exceeding 10% to sales. North America's $113 million year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating our strong value proposition.
North America's unit volume increase was driven by growth in both OE and the replacement channels. Our commercial truck volume was also strong in the second quarter, driven by strong OE demand for our fuel-efficient tires, such as the Fuel Max LHS steer and LHD drive tires. Remember, fuel is among the top 2 largest expenditures for fleets. And as such, identifying the most fuel-efficient tire is a critical factor impacting fleet profitability.
Through the first half of 2015, North America has generated SOI of $519 million, equal to 13% of sales. This earnings power demonstrates the strength of our strategy and overall value proposition.
Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $108 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 8% over last year's $117 million. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $25 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Our unit volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. And the volume decline was due to 2 factors. First, a continuation of increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This area is where we have seen additional pressure driven by an increase in Asian imports. And second, the discontinuation of our farm tire operation last year. Together, these headwinds offset volume increases we saw year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segments in the region.
As Rich mentioned, strong summer tire sales during the quarter in Western Europe helped offset declines we saw in winter tire sell-in year-over-year. However, with our previously announced price increases in Europe taking effect in July, we see some of the volume benefit in the quarter as pull-ahead of third quarter demand. In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment, and we have gained share in replacement based on the strength of our premium-branded products.
Our EMEA business has delivered solid underlying performance in the first half of 2015. While there will continue to be challenges with foreign currency headwinds, as Rich mentioned, we are very confident in our winter product portfolio, and we have taken a cautious approach on volume expectations for the back half of the year given some summer demand pull-ahead and winter inventory remaining in the channels from last year's very warm winter. Even as we plan for a green winter, there is still some risk due to the unpredictable nature of the weather and a potential repeat of last year's warm temperatures through the fourth quarter.
Asia-Pacific generated segment operating income of $84 million in the quarter, an increase of 11% over last year's $76 million. The main contributors to the earnings growth were increased volume and favorable price/mix versus raw material cost, partially offset by higher SAG expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Volume of 6 million units was 5% higher than a year ago and was primarily driven by 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets, with double-digit growth in India and China.
In China, our volume growth in the quarter was driven by our OE business, where we have been successful in winning new business and gaining share, in addition to participating in the overall industry growth. We are also proud to report that in June, we launched the EfficientGrip Performance tire for Chinese luxury consumers, offering best-in-class quiet and comfort. As Rich touched on, although China's economic growth has recently moderated from the levels seen in the first half of the year, we are still excited about the long-term growth opportunities we see for our business in Asia. In addition, on Slide 16, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided some further details on our operations in China. In India, we enjoyed double-digit volume growth versus the prior year in both the consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses.
In Latin America, our volume decreased about 4%. We again saw double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by weakness in Brazil, especially in the OE and commercial replacement segments, which are feeling the effects of a significant recession. We also saw year-over-year volume declines in Venezuela as we have been operating at lower levels of production than last year. Segment operating income was $43 million for the quarter, $16 million less than the prior year. Latin America benefited from positive price/mix, which is more than offset by the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs as well as lower volume.
For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $36 million, although the impact of Venezuela on our net income for the quarter was $24 million, which included $12 million of foreign currency exchange losses due to a weakening in Venezuela's SICAD rate.
While the macroeconomic conditions and currency controls remain challenging, the team has been able to obtain sufficient US dollars to purchase raw materials to support our operations, albeit at a lower-than-optimal level. I'll discuss our latest thinking as it relates to Venezuela as part of our full year outlook in a moment.
Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities while, at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to better match the lower volumes in this recessionary environment.
Slide 12 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume, overhead absorption, currency and Amiens closure-related savings are all unchanged from our April call. We continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, with strength in North America, a cautious view on EMEA's second half volumes, an increasingly challenging environment in Brazil and lower growth expectations for China. The updates to our outlook are due to Venezuela. The 2 changes to our 2015 SOI drivers are in the price/mix versus raw materials and net cost savings outlook line. As we were able to continue profitable operations in Venezuela throughout the first half, and at this time, we have enough visibility to expect access to U.S. dollars for raw material purchases that will enable us to remain at current production levels through the third quarter. As a result, we have updated our outlook to reflect the effect of Venezuela results through the various SOI drivers rather than including Venezuela as a separate line item. Overall, Venezuela will meaningfully increase our price/mix versus raw material expectations and decrease our net cost savings guidance. Both of these changes are a reflection of the highly inflationary environment in the country.
Taken together, these changes incorporating Venezuela are a $70 million improvement versus our April outlook. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $330 million for price/mix net of raw material changes. Raw material costs are expected to be 7% lower than last year before cost savings actions due to slight increases in underlying raw material costs since April, particularly for natural rubber in the second quarter. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.
The other significant change in the outlook relates to the net cost savings, where including Venezuela significantly increases the overall inflation headwind. As a result, we have reduced the net cost savings to approximately $70 million for the year. I want to be clear: this reflects simply the higher inflation related to including Venezuela results throughout the outlook. Our operational excellence programs are on plan and delivering as expected.
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 13, and each is consistent with what we provided on our April call. In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces but, in total, has increased $70 million, reflecting the operating income improvement from our Venezuela operations. Excluding Venezuela, our full year outlook is unchanged.
Our strong performance over the first 6 months gives us confidence that we will reach our SOI growth target of 10% to 15% in 2015. In addition, we continue to execute our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. And including the $50 million in repurchases during the second quarter, we've now repurchased $283 million under our 2014 through 2016 plan.
Now we'll open the line up for your questions."

And then secondly, can you comment even directionally on how you expect North America price/mix to track in 3Q or 2H compared to 2Q or 1H? I imagine the -- with the sort of on-again, off-again preliminary tariffs in the first half being replaced with now permanent duties in the back half, that pricing independent of raws faster [ph] could be stronger. Do you agree with that directionally? And then regarding raws, should just 2 potentially get better at least in 3Q, given your FIFO accounting and the fact that prices seem to have bottomed about 1.5 quarters prior to 3Q, which I think is roughly consistent with your traditional lag between spot prices and impact to the P&L?"

I guess, first thing is, we don't break out the difference between price/mix, and we're not going to start doing that as we go ahead. But I think as you look at where we're at, obviously, we're very pleased with the results of the business. And I think about -- as you think about Q2 and first half and then roll it into second half, I think the first thing that I would say is, what we're seeing is our goal of creating a business that can deliver sustainable value, sustainable results over the long term. And the decisions that we've taken in the past around our fixed costs, around efficiency, around business choices, around our new product portfolio, around innovation, around putting a focus on the consumer and driving our strategy, those 3 elements of our strategy with the right team, you're seeing that take root and really delivering in this quarter. And I would suggest it's been delivering over the last number of quarters, number of years. So as we think about second half, I think that underlying business model certainly will continue. We also got the benefit now. As you know, we've got lower gas prices. We've got better unemployment. We see miles driven being up, I think, 15 reported periods in a row. That means more tread rubber is being burned on the roads. We see a stronger OE business in the U.S. sort of the $17 million SAR. And the work we did on our -- getting on the right fitments is certainly paying dividends as well. So as we look into second half, I think some of that momentum will certainly still be there. As we look at what we said earlier in the year, we said that we would have a strong second half as well in North America. We're also releasing some new tires again, part of the Kelly Edge power line. We have new tires going into Walmart. We have a new Assurance tire coming out. So certainly, that's going to help our momentum as well as we move ahead. I'll tell you, we still have -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we still have some supply constraints on some of the HVA tires that our customers want, and we're still trying to work on that as we get into the second half and beyond, getting more tires out of the factories that we have and more out of the import plan that we have as well. So all that momentum, I think, does carry into the second half as we go. And in terms of where raw materials will be, I would point you back toward the assumption page that Laura can talk to here. We really haven't changed much where we are. I think we said about -- what was it, an 8% reduction for the year."

I mean, I know our U.S. economy is not hitting on all cylinders, but it's certainly improved. And I think there's certainly some pent-up demand out there that's going over the roads. In addition, the OE business is very strong as well. As truck builds, I know you guys do, or your colleagues follow the trucking industry, you know what the boards look like in terms of new truck builds. So there is a market, I think a favorable market out there in terms of freight and in terms of demand for trucks, and consequently, demand for tires. We also have built our business around not just -- and I think this is really the most important thing I can say. It's not just about tires; it's about the whole freight services solutions that we bring. And I think particularly in an environment where there's more trucks on the road, being a full-service fleet provider -- meaning, new tires, retreads and ability to get truckers up and running when they have issues on the road and providing truck tires and have the fuel economy that really, as Laura mentioned in the remarks, can save trucking companies money on fuel, it's that whole value proposition, I would suggest to you, that drives our business results. And that's important because that model will also be beneficial to us when the industry is not a strong as it is right now. So that really is, I would tell you, the underlying strength that we have. And I would say very proudly, I think we have the best business model in North America by far."

As I've",426,"So Rod, from a North American perspective, I think the market's up because you had non-Chinese imports come in mostly at the low end of the market again. And that's not, as you know, a place where we play. So that's really what drove that market. As I've said in the past, we're sticking to our strategy. We're not just pursuing volume for volume's sake. We're pursuing those parts of the market where we can create value for ourselves and for our customers. And that's what we're doing. A lot of that bump comes at the low end. And exactly as you said, I think you hit it exactly right. With the Kelly Edge, with the Douglas power line, the Kelly power line, with another Assurance tire we're putting in, we're taking that HVA technology, as we said in one of our megatrends a number of years ago, bringing that down into the mid-tier where we can get value for the Kelly name and for the Goodyear name as we move ahead. And that was our strategy, it is our strategy, and that bump really comes in places that don't -- that doesn't affect us as significantly as the numbers might suggest. And from a Europe perspective, I think when you look at our volume year-over-year, 2 things to keep in mind: one, we had a significant sell-in in winter tires in Q2 last year, so that made it a tough comp because we didn't see that sell-in again this year; and also, you're seeing the reduction in our farm business, which I think accounted for about 1/3 of our volume loss in our volume change year-over-year because we're completely out of the farm business now, so that was sort of a onetime impact that you see there. So those 2 things really say what volume is. It doesn't have a -- we don't view it as a significant impact -- a significant concern as we look at Q2 volumes. And your comment on -- obviously, Rod, maybe just to add to that one other quick thing. Winter in Q3 and Q4 is obviously something we're paying very close attention to because that is a significant item to the industry and to Goodyear. And finally, in terms of raw materials, the price increase you mentioned that we had in Europe, remember, our raw materials, particularly natural rubber but other raw materials, are dollar-based. So with a weakening euro, our raw material costs are going up. And I think that's the logic of what you're seeing there."

I'll take a step back by saying we have what we feel is an excellent business in China. We've been there a long time, since 1994 actually, and our business model there is largely focused in the premium/HVA part of the market. We have low LVA-type tires that we make and sell over there. So we have a very good business mix. And we supply that, by and large, with one of our most technologically advanced and really best-performing factories in Pulandian, where we have capacity of about 11 million consumer tires and about 0.5 million truck tires there. So we've been there a long time, we've seen the bumps in the road, and we get that. As we look at our business, we still think China will be a growth market over the long term. Today, it's about -- the industry is about a 50-50 split between OE and replacement. And remember, that's really different than the rest of the world or our mature markets. As we -- when we describe our company, we say about 30% OE, 70% replacement, China is a little bit different as that market matures and as cars get put on the road. So as you think about our business there, it's a little bit different mix, and obviously, there's a little bit different margin change, 50-50 versus 30-70, in terms of how we think about the rest of the world as well. So that's sort of a picture of our business. Our focus there, Itay, continues to be on growing our branded business and expanding our distribution. We had a very good second quarter both in OE and a strong quarter in replacement as well. As I mentioned, we are going to continue to focus on growing our business in places like Walmart and Sam's Club, where we're the exclusive tire -- and just recently, in Sam's Club as well. And we see opportunities beyond sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities. We play into Tier 2 and Tier 3 and see a lot of growth opportunities for us there. That's sort of the next phase as we move ahead. So we still feel very optimistic about the long term. But listen, the -- all the things that everyone's been following, we've seen a lot of the OEMs take down their forecasts on the industry and on growth, and we see the same thing there. So we have -- we saw growth in the first half, and we see that certainly changing in the second half and be about flat as we look to the year is what we see there. So we'll have some headwinds there, but we also have a plant, as I said, that has high technology. We import some from that today, and you would be right to think that we're going to think about how we use that capacity in other ways, both in the Asia region as well as possibly in other parts of the world as well. So a clear bump in the road, a clear headwind that we have to deal with. And I'll just say, we can and we will, and we're going to remain very -- we do remain very optimistic about our prospects in China over the long term."

One, as we look at the economy, there's still a lot of volatility. We said, I don't know how many, it's probably for a number of years now, that we saw sort of Europe continuing to muddle along, and we still see that happening with injections into the economy to get it going again. We see the pressure on the euro. We see the Russia-Ukraine situation potentially popping its head up at some point. We certainly can't prognosticate there. And we saw what happened with Greece. So there's still a lot of volatility going on. And that's always underneath us to think about what has to happen. And frankly, it's why we're focused on our cost structure as well. You may recall, we announced a restructuring plan in the U.K. to take out about 400 headcount and close our mixing and retread operations there. And you'll see us focusing on our cost structure, representative of that uncertainty in the market. So I think that's one thing that remains in our thinking. And secondly, the winter markets are determinative. And what's determinative in the winter markets is the weather. So that will have an impact for us as we look to the second half of the year. And maybe to frame it for you again, I think we're coming off of, what, 3 warm winters in a row, green or yellow. So what you see is you've got sort of a wait-and-see attitude from dealers who typically don't go long on inventory. Coming out of a warmer winter, you've got some inventory in the channel as it is, and there's just a little uncertainty under there. So we have taken a very measured approach, a balanced approach. We plan for a ""green winter,"" not a white winter, and we're doing that very consciously to manage our business and manage our factories and manage our inventory. So those things, I think, are going to come into play into the back half of the year. So that's really how we think about it. Laura, I don't know if you'd add anything to that."

The brand that we bring, which brings customers to dealer stores, the products, the innovation we have in them, the customer service that we bring, the promotions that we put out in the market, all those things go into how we think about our price versus just a raw material or a cost input. So while I can't speak specifically on price, maybe I can just give you a little bit of flavor of some of the things happening in our regions. And I'll start with EMEA. And really, I'll be a bit repetitive here and say, I think it was Rod who mentioned that we had a price increase in the second quarter. And that really was reflective of the fact that our raw materials are dollar-based. And as the euro weakens, it makes our costs go up. And I think that's a headwind that we have to deal with as we think about Europe. As we go to Asia, also there, as raw material prices change, they move quicker through our P&L, as I just mentioned a while ago. So as we see those raw material fluctuations, I would just point out that, that region gets hits quicker, and it has to react quicker. And that's what that team does there. And also, remember in places like Australia and India and other places like that, they, too, have the currency pressure while sourcing materials in U.S. dollars as well. And also we see, a bit in Asia and particularly in China, more of the China-based products staying home versus being exported. So we see some of that capacity coming into the market in China as well. But I'd also tell you, most of that's on the low end. And as I previously mentioned, we particularly play in the premium segments or the HVA segments in China. And in Latin America, I'd say the biggest thing to be aware of there is simply the slower OE production. As I mentioned, new car production was down about 20% -- over 20%, so that overcapacity is certainly in the market there, and any situation where supply is ahead of demand has an impact. But also, I would say, with the real devaluing, what's happened is domestic manufacturers, certainly, of which we are one, have an advantage now, the opposite of what we had before, as a weaker real means less imports being purchased by our customers there. And that certainly helps us in terms of our market there. And I think our changes in what we've done in places like Brazil in terms of new products and engaging our dealers, all that has resulted in big market share gains for us in Brazil and volume increases in Brazil in 2015. And in North America, I think we probably covered that with some of the other calls. So that's just maybe some color on what's happening in the markets. And I'll just say, our goal is to continue to capture the value of our brands for our customers and ourselves. And that's what we're focused on."

How do we think about your increased emphasis, let's say, on the Kelly brand relative to your longstanding strategy of kind of moving towards higher value-added, higher-margin tires and so forth?

One, if you go back to when we introduced the megatrends, I mean, we don't go back and talk about those as such. But if you remember, we said that the trend would be the HVA or bigger rim diameter, a more complex constructed tires, better rolling resistance, so on and so forth, would migrate to the mid-tier. And that's exactly what's happening, and you see that on new car fitments. So that was, I think, something we knew. W called it was going to happen. We saw it happening, and it is, and it says that mid-tier is a place to be with HVA tires. Secondly, as we look at the market, we had to get our business model in line to get out of some of the private label business, which we did, and we moved up-market where we could get value for the brands. And then we want to -- we are, and we said we wanted to play in that mid-tier section, particularly mid-tier commuter touring because that is the single largest part of the auto market and the tire market, if you will. So playing in there with Goodyear brand, in some cases, and the Kelly brand, in other cases, really sets us up very well to get the value of our brand, to put the technology in there and to do that as an alternative for dealers and consumers who, in most cases, would rather have that Kelly or Goodyear tire than an imported tire. And that was, I think, a strategy we had planned and the strategy we're executing."

This morning, I will review highlights from our outstanding second quarter, provide an update on how the macroeconomics in our regions are affecting our business and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions.
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $556 million, a record for any quarter in the company's history and a 21% improvement versus last year. Also, if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, our operating performance improved by 28% in the quarter. These were simply excellent results for our team.
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter results, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $947 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. By comparison, that's higher than our full year segment operating income in 2010. 
In addition, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 13% in the second quarter despite significant foreign currency headwinds and regional macro-economic challenges. Leading the way, our North American business delivered record segment operating income and nearly a 16% segment operating margin, its highest in my 15 years at Goodyear and likely longer than that. In addition, 3 of our 4 global businesses delivered operating margins of greater than 10% in tougher-than-expected economic environments.
Taken in total, our record second quarter performance reflects the strength and disciplined execution of our strategy. We believe that strength comes largely from the integration of the key how-tos on our strategy road map: innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence supported by an aligned and collaborative team. While each is a significant element in our plan, their value multiplies when they're integrated. Our current results reflect that value, and we've only just begun to tap into its full potential.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for each for the remainder of the year.
North America delivered $321 million of segment operating income, a record for any quarter. This performance was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating the earnings power of our value proposition in a strong market. During the quarter, demand in our replacement business remained solid, and we began to see the benefits of our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. Early demand for these tires has exceeded our expectations as our market-backed innovation has allowed us to bring HVA attributes to the mid-tier segments.
Similarly, we've increased our share in OE, which continues to deliver profitable results by selling HVA products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and the Assurance Fuel Max on some of the most popular vehicles, in line with our strategy. The results are paying dividends not only in our OE performance, but also in the Goodyear brand replacement pull-through as consumers visit our aligned dealers. The enhancements to our product mix have been an important enabler of North America's improved value proposition. 
Now during the first half, we also began to roll out our new e-commerce platform for consumer replacement tires. We developed our online sales strategy to reduce friction or, in other words, to make the tire buying process easier for consumers. The program is still in the early stages, but it has met or exceeded our initial expectations while providing many key learnings needed to implement it successfully over the long term as consumers change their buying habits. We remain confident that this program, with our industry-leading dealer network and more than 4,000 locations enrolled to date, will drive profitability through the value chain.
Our commercial truck tire business also had a strong second quarter based on the robust demand for our industry-leading products. In June, we unveiled a new commercial tire product, the Endurance WHA for waste haul fleets, which will be available later this year. Our total portfolio of commercial truck tire offerings has never been better. And combined with our fleet service model that's the gold standard of the industry, that makes Goodyear the clear leader -- a clear industry leader in the commercial truck business.
Across all of our segments in North America, our value proposition has allowed us to excel in a market where drivers of demand have remained very strong. New passenger vehicle sales are at the highest in a decade. Miles driven for the first 5 months of the year was at an all-time record, and we project miles driven for the full year to be a record as well. And year-to-date truck tonnage has increased 3% over the same period last year. All are leading indicators for good tire markets, and we believe the underlying fundamentals will remain favorable for some time.
We've consistently said that it was a question of when, not if, industry fundamentals would improve, and they have. As I look at the success of our North American business and the industry fundamentals, our challenge continues to be meeting growing demand for our HVA tires. As we've outlined, in the short term, we are investing in our factories locally and leveraging our global footprints to deliver more of the tires that our customers want. In fact, we broke ground yesterday in San Luis Potosí, Mexico for our previously announced new manufacturing plant which will help satisfy demand and allow us to grow over the long term.
Shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered $108 million in segment operating income during the second quarter, down about 8% versus the prior year, which was more than explained by the weak euro. Excluding the impact of currency, EMEA grew 14% year-over-year. EMEA's performance was led by the successful execution of our strategy of growing in targeted market segments, along with the strength in summer tire sales in Western Europe.
Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly the Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and EfficientGrip SUV tires, claimed the top spots in several important magazine tests, which helped facilitate strong demand and growth in those segments during the summer season. Industry sell-in for summer tires was strong during the quarter and helped to offset the difficult year-over-year comparisons for winter tire sell-in. You'll remember that last year, winter tire sell-in started earlier in the second quarter. As we predicted last quarter, we did not see the same early sell-in this year.
Heading into the second half of the year, we're taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer-than-usual weather Europe has had over the past 3 years, the higher levels of inventory currently in the channels and a wait-and-see approach by the dealers. Customers may be reluctant to build large inventories of winter tires, and sell-in to retail channels may be delayed. Clearly, the unpredictable winter weather will affect buying patterns, which remain difficult to gauge. Regardless, we're confident our award-winning winter products will position us to win in the marketplace.
In our commercial segment, our recent share growth has been fueled by our outstanding products and increased demand from fleets. For example, last month, Goodyear was honored with a Luxembourg Green Product Award for its FUELMAX S truck tire. The tire features IntelliMax Groove Technology, which was cited as a major breakthrough in the tire industry for fuel efficiency and operating cost reduction. It is this type of innovation that continues to enhance our value proposition and win with fleets around Europe. Like our success in North America, EMEA's end-to-end fleet service solutions and strong product lineup is driving our year-to-date success and winning new customers.
Emerging markets in Eastern Europe continue to struggle with an influx of low-cost Asian imports. This is a trend we saw in previous quarters and one that we believe will continue in the second half of the year. Given the macro-economic conditions in Europe, we have and will continue to take actions to better align our cost. In June, we announced the planned closure of our mixing and retread operation in Wolverhampton, England and some other changes within our EMEA footprint. These actions will help facilitate a more competitive cost structure.
With the economic uncertainties in Europe surrounding currency, the situation in Greece and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we believe these are the appropriate and the prudent steps to manage our business. We do not foresee the economic situation improving during the second half of the year and expect the euro to continue to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar.
Through the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on strengthening our value proposition, reducing our costs and winning in our targeted market segments where the value of our brands differentiates us from the competition.
Latin America continues to be a very volatile region as well. Our business there delivered segment operating income of $43 million, down year-over-year because of the recessionary conditions in Brazil. I'm pleased, however, with how our team has executed in this environment. There was double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in many of our Latin America growth markets, including Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by the weakness in consumer OE, particularly in Brazil, which remains in a recession. New vehicle sales declined 24% in the second quarter and are down 21% year-to-date versus 2014. Venezuela's fluid economic and political situation continues to create challenges and volatility in our Latin America business. However, we are pleased our team has been very successful in continuing to operate profitably in the country while servicing the strong demand for our replacement products. Laura will elaborate on Venezuela in her comments in a moment.
As I said last quarter, with currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile, but we also remain optimistic about the region's long-term prospects.
Finally, in Asia-Pacific, strong volume growth in China and India contributed to segment operating income at $84 million and operating margin of more than 17% in the second quarter. In India, our strategy has been a success as OE and consumer replacement volumes and share both increased, driven by new vehicle launches and strong branded retail performance.
During the quarter, we launched the Assurance TripleMax tire for the mid-tier passenger segment in India. This is a product that has been very successful in other countries in the region over the past 18 months, and we anticipate it will be in high demand here as well.
In China, we continue to have strong year-over-year growth in our consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses but at a pace slower than anticipated. The slower growth is largely due to a combination of weaker new car sales, domestic stock market volatility and lagging consumer confidence. While the macro-economic environment in China is expected to soften relative to the first half, we are driving initiatives to support our growth goals. For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Walmart in China, and Goodyear also is now the exclusive tire brand available through Sam's Club stores and online. Going forward, we are focused on driving incremental replacement tire sales in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, taking advantage of additional opportunities to grow our customer base.
As we said in the past, China's growth may not be in a straight line, but it's the world's largest auto market. We expect continued growth over the balance of the year but with stronger headwinds than in the first half. We remain confident in our long-term growth in China.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy, the focus on our targeted segments and our team's commitment to maximizing value through the integration of our key how-tos. Our 14% segment operating income growth in the first half gives us confidence that we will reach our 10% to 15% growth target despite challenges in the global economy. Our commitment to those objectives is unwavering, but we will be flexible in how we arrive at our strategic destination of creating sustainable value.
Many of our markets are considerably more volatile than they were when we developed our plan. We will have additional bumps in the road, but we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year. By running our business for the long term, we won't be distracted by the now familiar fluctuations in the marketplace or the expected headwinds in our industry. Our strategy is solid, it's working, and it delivered in the quarter as evidenced by 21% year-over-year segment operating income growth and by a 13% operating margin. We believe it will continue to drive strong results.
I'll now turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results, and I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to Slide 7, I would like to highlight a few items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance showing both volume growth and strong improvement in our segment operating income. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in EMEA and Latin America.
Looking at our net sales for the quarter. The impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced sales by $401 million year-over-year. In addition, other tire-related sales were lower by $81 million. The decline in other tire-related sales was driven by lower third-party chemical sales in North America, reflecting lower commodity costs. Gross margin improved 3.3 points to 27.4%, improving segment operating income to a record $556 million with an SOI margin of 13.3% for the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.70. Our results were influenced by certain significant items which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.84.
As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the first quarter, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.13, up $0.33 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years.
The step chart on Slide 8 walks second quarter 2014 segment operating income to second quarter 2015. The positive impact of volume growth and lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs was $8 million. Lower raw material cost of $108 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $7 million for a net benefit of $101 million during the quarter. While this performance is well ahead of our previous guidance for the second quarter of $25 million to $50 million, about half of the net price/mix versus raw materials in the quarter was a benefit from our Venezuelan operations. Excluding Venezuela, our price/mix and raw material performance came in at the high end of our guidance range.
Cost-saving actions of $101 million more than offset the $71 million impact of inflation, which was driven primarily by Latin America. The highly inflationary environment in Venezuela significantly impacted our net savings in the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have almost doubled. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $35 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 9. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and essentially unchanged versus the prior quarter and the second quarter of last year. This cash balance includes $304 million of cash in Venezuela. Our total debt and our net debt are effectively flat with our first quarter balances as well. Net debt is lower than the second quarter last year by $660 million, following our strong free cash flow performance in 2014.
Slide 10 shows we generated $377 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Working capital was a source of cash and more than explains the $63 million improvement in free cash flow compared to the prior year. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.1 billion.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America had another great quarter with an all-time record segment operating income of $321 million. This is the 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, and with a segment operating margin of 15.8%, the fifth quarter in a row of earnings exceeding 10% to sales. North America's $113 million year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by positive price/mix and raw material costs, demonstrating our strong value proposition.
North America's unit volume increase was driven by growth in both OE and the replacement channels. Our commercial truck volume was also strong in the second quarter, driven by strong OE demand for our fuel-efficient tires, such as the Fuel Max LHS steer and LHD drive tires. Remember, fuel is among the top 2 largest expenditures for fleets. And as such, identifying the most fuel-efficient tire is a critical factor impacting fleet profitability.
Through the first half of 2015, North America has generated SOI of $519 million, equal to 13% of sales. This earnings power demonstrates the strength of our strategy and overall value proposition.
Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $108 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 8% over last year's $117 million. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $25 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Our unit volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. And the volume decline was due to 2 factors. First, a continuation of increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This area is where we have seen additional pressure driven by an increase in Asian imports. And second, the discontinuation of our farm tire operation last year. Together, these headwinds offset volume increases we saw year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segments in the region.
As Rich mentioned, strong summer tire sales during the quarter in Western Europe helped offset declines we saw in winter tire sell-in year-over-year. However, with our previously announced price increases in Europe taking effect in July, we see some of the volume benefit in the quarter as pull-ahead of third quarter demand. In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment, and we have gained share in replacement based on the strength of our premium-branded products.
Our EMEA business has delivered solid underlying performance in the first half of 2015. While there will continue to be challenges with foreign currency headwinds, as Rich mentioned, we are very confident in our winter product portfolio, and we have taken a cautious approach on volume expectations for the back half of the year given some summer demand pull-ahead and winter inventory remaining in the channels from last year's very warm winter. Even as we plan for a green winter, there is still some risk due to the unpredictable nature of the weather and a potential repeat of last year's warm temperatures through the fourth quarter.
Asia-Pacific generated segment operating income of $84 million in the quarter, an increase of 11% over last year's $76 million. The main contributors to the earnings growth were increased volume and favorable price/mix versus raw material cost, partially offset by higher SAG expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Volume of 6 million units was 5% higher than a year ago and was primarily driven by 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets, with double-digit growth in India and China.
In China, our volume growth in the quarter was driven by our OE business, where we have been successful in winning new business and gaining share, in addition to participating in the overall industry growth. We are also proud to report that in June, we launched the EfficientGrip Performance tire for Chinese luxury consumers, offering best-in-class quiet and comfort. As Rich touched on, although China's economic growth has recently moderated from the levels seen in the first half of the year, we are still excited about the long-term growth opportunities we see for our business in Asia. In addition, on Slide 16, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided some further details on our operations in China. In India, we enjoyed double-digit volume growth versus the prior year in both the consumer replacement and consumer OE businesses.
In Latin America, our volume decreased about 4%. We again saw double-digit growth in consumer replacement volumes in Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by weakness in Brazil, especially in the OE and commercial replacement segments, which are feeling the effects of a significant recession. We also saw year-over-year volume declines in Venezuela as we have been operating at lower levels of production than last year. Segment operating income was $43 million for the quarter, $16 million less than the prior year. Latin America benefited from positive price/mix, which is more than offset by the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs as well as lower volume.
For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $36 million, although the impact of Venezuela on our net income for the quarter was $24 million, which included $12 million of foreign currency exchange losses due to a weakening in Venezuela's SICAD rate.
While the macroeconomic conditions and currency controls remain challenging, the team has been able to obtain sufficient US dollars to purchase raw materials to support our operations, albeit at a lower-than-optimal level. I'll discuss our latest thinking as it relates to Venezuela as part of our full year outlook in a moment.
Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities while, at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to better match the lower volumes in this recessionary environment.
Slide 12 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume, overhead absorption, currency and Amiens closure-related savings are all unchanged from our April call. We continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, with strength in North America, a cautious view on EMEA's second half volumes, an increasingly challenging environment in Brazil and lower growth expectations for China. The updates to our outlook are due to Venezuela. The 2 changes to our 2015 SOI drivers are in the price/mix versus raw materials and net cost savings outlook line. As we were able to continue profitable operations in Venezuela throughout the first half, and at this time, we have enough visibility to expect access to U.S. dollars for raw material purchases that will enable us to remain at current production levels through the third quarter. As a result, we have updated our outlook to reflect the effect of Venezuela results through the various SOI drivers rather than including Venezuela as a separate line item. Overall, Venezuela will meaningfully increase our price/mix versus raw material expectations and decrease our net cost savings guidance. Both of these changes are a reflection of the highly inflationary environment in the country.
Taken together, these changes incorporating Venezuela are a $70 million improvement versus our April outlook. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $330 million for price/mix net of raw material changes. Raw material costs are expected to be 7% lower than last year before cost savings actions due to slight increases in underlying raw material costs since April, particularly for natural rubber in the second quarter. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.
The other significant change in the outlook relates to the net cost savings, where including Venezuela significantly increases the overall inflation headwind. As a result, we have reduced the net cost savings to approximately $70 million for the year. I want to be clear: this reflects simply the higher inflation related to including Venezuela results throughout the outlook. Our operational excellence programs are on plan and delivering as expected.
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 13, and each is consistent with what we provided on our April call. In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces but, in total, has increased $70 million, reflecting the operating income improvement from our Venezuela operations. Excluding Venezuela, our full year outlook is unchanged.
Our strong performance over the first 6 months gives us confidence that we will reach our SOI growth target of 10% to 15% in 2015. In addition, we continue to execute our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. And including the $50 million in repurchases during the second quarter, we've now repurchased $283 million under our 2014 through 2016 plan.
Now we'll open the line up for your questions."

I think it's important to understand what's happening with price/mix to raws. Some first questions, can you break that out for North America now like I think you will in your Q? And then secondly, can you comment even directionally on how you expect North America price/mix to track in 3Q or 2H compared to 2Q or 1H? I imagine the -- with the sort of on-again, off-again preliminary tariffs in the first half being replaced with now permanent duties in the back half, that pricing independent of raws faster [ph] could be stronger. Do you agree with that directionally? And then regarding raws, should just 2 potentially get better at least in 3Q, given your FIFO accounting and the fact that prices seem to have bottomed about 1.5 quarters prior to 3Q, which I think is roughly consistent with your traditional lag between spot prices and impact to the P&L?"

But I think as you look at where we're at, obviously",493,"So Ryan, we'll try to tag-team. You have a lot of questions in here. I guess, first thing is, we don't break out the difference between price/mix, and we're not going to start doing that as we go ahead. But I think as you look at where we're at, obviously, we're very pleased with the results of the business. And I think about -- as you think about Q2 and first half and then roll it into second half, I think the first thing that I would say is, what we're seeing is our goal of creating a business that can deliver sustainable value, sustainable results over the long term. And the decisions that we've taken in the past around our fixed costs, around efficiency, around business choices, around our new product portfolio, around innovation, around putting a focus on the consumer and driving our strategy, those 3 elements of our strategy with the right team, you're seeing that take root and really delivering in this quarter. And I would suggest it's been delivering over the last number of quarters, number of years. So as we think about second half, I think that underlying business model certainly will continue. We also got the benefit now. As you know, we've got lower gas prices. We've got better unemployment. We see miles driven being up, I think, 15 reported periods in a row. That means more tread rubber is being burned on the roads. We see a stronger OE business in the U.S. sort of the $17 million SAR. And the work we did on our -- getting on the right fitments is certainly paying dividends as well. So as we look into second half, I think some of that momentum will certainly still be there. As we look at what we said earlier in the year, we said that we would have a strong second half as well in North America. We're also releasing some new tires again, part of the Kelly Edge power line. We have new tires going into Walmart. We have a new Assurance tire coming out. So certainly, that's going to help our momentum as well as we move ahead. I'll tell you, we still have -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we still have some supply constraints on some of the HVA tires that our customers want, and we're still trying to work on that as we get into the second half and beyond, getting more tires out of the factories that we have and more out of the import plan that we have as well. So all that momentum, I think, does carry into the second half as we go. And in terms of where raw materials will be, I would point you back toward the assumption page that Laura can talk to here. We really haven't changed much where we are. I think we said about -- what was it, an 8% reduction for the year."

In addition, the OE business is very strong as well. As truck builds, I know you guys do, or your colleagues follow the trucking industry, you know what the boards look like in terms of new truck builds. So there is a market, I think a favorable market out there in terms of freight and in terms of demand for trucks, and consequently, demand for tires. We also have built our business around not just -- and I think this is really the most important thing I can say. It's not just about tires; it's about the whole freight services solutions that we bring. And I think particularly in an environment where there's more trucks on the road, being a full-service fleet provider -- meaning, new tires, retreads and ability to get truckers up and running when they have issues on the road and providing truck tires and have the fuel economy that really, as Laura mentioned in the remarks, can save trucking companies money on fuel, it's that whole value proposition, I would suggest to you, that drives our business results. And that's important because that model will also be beneficial to us when the industry is not a strong as it is right now. So that really is, I would tell you, the underlying strength that we have.

And then in Europe, you explained the market share issue there with Eastern Europe and Western Europe, but it's a bit surprising that you're implementing a price increase even though raw material costs are down.

As I've",426,"So Rod, from a North American perspective, I think the market's up because you had non-Chinese imports come in mostly at the low end of the market again. And that's not, as you know, a place where we play. So that's really what drove that market. As I've said in the past, we're sticking to our strategy. We're not just pursuing volume for volume's sake. We're pursuing those parts of the market where we can create value for ourselves and for our customers. And that's what we're doing. A lot of that bump comes at the low end. And exactly as you said, I think you hit it exactly right. With the Kelly Edge, with the Douglas power line, the Kelly power line, with another Assurance tire we're putting in, we're taking that HVA technology, as we said in one of our megatrends a number of years ago, bringing that down into the mid-tier where we can get value for the Kelly name and for the Goodyear name as we move ahead. And that was our strategy, it is our strategy, and that bump really comes in places that don't -- that doesn't affect us as significantly as the numbers might suggest. And from a Europe perspective, I think when you look at our volume year-over-year, 2 things to keep in mind: one, we had a significant sell-in in winter tires in Q2 last year, so that made it a tough comp because we didn't see that sell-in again this year; and also, you're seeing the reduction in our farm business, which I think accounted for about 1/3 of our volume loss in our volume change year-over-year because we're completely out of the farm business now, so that was sort of a onetime impact that you see there. So those 2 things really say what volume is. It doesn't have a -- we don't view it as a significant impact -- a significant concern as we look at Q2 volumes. And your comment on -- obviously, Rod, maybe just to add to that one other quick thing. Winter in Q3 and Q4 is obviously something we're paying very close attention to because that is a significant item to the industry and to Goodyear. And finally, in terms of raw materials, the price increase you mentioned that we had in Europe, remember, our raw materials, particularly natural rubber but other raw materials, are dollar-based. So with a weakening euro, our raw material costs are going up. And I think that's the logic of what you're seeing there."

I'll take a step back by saying we have what we feel is an excellent business in China. We've been there a long time, since 1994 actually, and our business model there is largely focused in the premium/HVA part of the market. We have low LVA-type tires that we make and sell over there. So we have a very good business mix. And we supply that, by and large, with one of our most technologically advanced and really best-performing factories in Pulandian, where we have capacity of about 11 million consumer tires and about 0.5 million truck tires there. So we've been there a long time, we've seen the bumps in the road, and we get that. As we look at our business, we still think China will be a growth market over the long term. Today, it's about -- the industry is about a 50-50 split between OE and replacement. And remember, that's really different than the rest of the world or our mature markets. As we -- when we describe our company, we say about 30% OE, 70% replacement, China is a little bit different as that market matures and as cars get put on the road. So as you think about our business there, it's a little bit different mix, and obviously, there's a little bit different margin change, 50-50 versus 30-70, in terms of how we think about the rest of the world as well. So that's sort of a picture of our business. Our focus there, Itay, continues to be on growing our branded business and expanding our distribution. We had a very good second quarter both in OE and a strong quarter in replacement as well. As I mentioned, we are going to continue to focus on growing our business in places like Walmart and Sam's Club, where we're the exclusive tire -- and just recently, in Sam's Club as well. And we see opportunities beyond sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities. We play into Tier 2 and Tier 3 and see a lot of growth opportunities for us there. That's sort of the next phase as we move ahead. So we still feel very optimistic about the long term. But listen, the -- all the things that everyone's been following, we've seen a lot of the OEMs take down their forecasts on the industry and on growth, and we see the same thing there. So we have -- we saw growth in the first half, and we see that certainly changing in the second half and be about flat as we look to the year is what we see there. So we'll have some headwinds there, but we also have a plant, as I said, that has high technology. We import some from that today, and you would be right to think that we're going to think about how we use that capacity in other ways, both in the Asia region as well as possibly in other parts of the world as well. So a clear bump in the road, a clear headwind that we have to deal with. And I'll just say, we can and we will, and we're going to remain very -- we do remain very optimistic about our prospects in China over the long term."

One, as we look at the economy, there's still a lot of volatility. We said, I don't know how many, it's probably for a number of years now, that we saw sort of Europe continuing to muddle along, and we still see that happening with injections into the economy to get it going again. We see the pressure on the euro. We see the Russia-Ukraine situation potentially popping its head up at some point. We certainly can't prognosticate there. And we saw what happened with Greece. So there's still a lot of volatility going on. And that's always underneath us to think about what has to happen. And frankly, it's why we're focused on our cost structure as well. You may recall, we announced a restructuring plan in the U.K. to take out about 400 headcount and close our mixing and retread operations there. And you'll see us focusing on our cost structure, representative of that uncertainty in the market. So I think that's one thing that remains in our thinking. And secondly, the winter markets are determinative. And what's determinative in the winter markets is the weather. So that will have an impact for us as we look to the second half of the year. And maybe to frame it for you again, I think we're coming off of, what, 3 warm winters in a row, green or yellow. So what you see is you've got sort of a wait-and-see attitude from dealers who typically don't go long on inventory. Coming out of a warmer winter, you've got some inventory in the channel as it is, and there's just a little uncertainty under there. So we have taken a very measured approach, a balanced approach. We plan for a ""green winter,"" not a white winter, and we're doing that very consciously to manage our business and manage our factories and manage our inventory. So those things, I think, are going to come into play into the back half of the year. So that's really how we think about it. Laura, I don't know if you'd add anything to that."

The brand that we bring, which brings customers to dealer stores, the products, the innovation we have in them, the customer service that we bring, the promotions that we put out in the market, all those things go into how we think about our price versus just a raw material or a cost input. So while I can't speak specifically on price, maybe I can just give you a little bit of flavor of some of the things happening in our regions. And I'll start with EMEA. And really, I'll be a bit repetitive here and say, I think it was Rod who mentioned that we had a price increase in the second quarter. And that really was reflective of the fact that our raw materials are dollar-based. And as the euro weakens, it makes our costs go up. And I think that's a headwind that we have to deal with as we think about Europe. As we go to Asia, also there, as raw material prices change, they move quicker through our P&L, as I just mentioned a while ago. So as we see those raw material fluctuations, I would just point out that, that region gets hits quicker, and it has to react quicker. And that's what that team does there. And also, remember in places like Australia and India and other places like that, they, too, have the currency pressure while sourcing materials in U.S. dollars as well. And also we see, a bit in Asia and particularly in China, more of the China-based products staying home versus being exported. So we see some of that capacity coming into the market in China as well. But I'd also tell you, most of that's on the low end. And as I previously mentioned, we particularly play in the premium segments or the HVA segments in China. And in Latin America, I'd say the biggest thing to be aware of there is simply the slower OE production. As I mentioned, new car production was down about 20% -- over 20%, so that overcapacity is certainly in the market there, and any situation where supply is ahead of demand has an impact. But also, I would say, with the real devaluing, what's happened is domestic manufacturers, certainly, of which we are one, have an advantage now, the opposite of what we had before, as a weaker real means less imports being purchased by our customers there. And that certainly helps us in terms of our market there. And I think our changes in what we've done in places like Brazil in terms of new products and engaging our dealers, all that has resulted in big market share gains for us in Brazil and volume increases in Brazil in 2015. And in North America, I think we probably covered that with some of the other calls. So that's just maybe some color on what's happening in the markets. And I'll just say, our goal is to continue to capture the value of our brands for our customers and ourselves. And that's what we're focused on."

One, if you go back to when we introduced the megatrends, I mean, we don't go back and talk about those as such. But if you remember, we said that the trend would be the HVA or bigger rim diameter, a more complex constructed tires, better rolling resistance, so on and so forth, would migrate to the mid-tier. And that's exactly what's happening, and you see that on new car fitments. So that was, I think, something we knew. We called it was going to happen. We saw it happening, and it is, and it says that mid-tier is a place to be with HVA tires. Secondly, as we look at the market, we had to get our business model in line to get out of some of the private label business, which we did, and we moved up-market where we could get value for the brands. And then we want to -- we are, and we said we wanted to play in that mid-tier section, particularly mid-tier commuter touring because that is the single largest part of the auto market and the tire market, if you will. So playing in there with Goodyear brand, in some cases, and the Kelly brand, in other cases, really sets us up very well to get the value of our brand, to put the technology in there and to do that as an alternative for dealers and consumers who, in most cases, would rather have that Kelly or Goodyear tire than an imported tire. And that was, I think, a strategy we had planned and the strategy we're executing."

I think from a sell-in standpoint, the numbers are muted and have been on a comparative basis as you've had big buy-aheads and then -- big periods of buy-aheads and then big periods of not buying. And that can kind of make the sell-in numbers, which those share numbers are based on, a little bit more difficult to read. I would tell you, and I've said this consistently, we're on our plan. We're not going to get thrown off our game because there was a big sell-in ahead, let's say -- buy-ahead for a tariff coming in where we look like we've lost share on a sell-in basis, and then have it reversed the next quarter where we look like we're up because dealers have stopped buying those imported tires because of the tariffs. We're not going to get thrown by a big up and a big down. We're on our way to play on an industry that is growing sellout 1% to 2% and driving it on our strategy.

This morning, I will review our record third quarter results, including our continued success in North America and provide examples of how executing our strategy in both robust and challenging markets. As",1877,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review our record third quarter results, including our continued success in North America and provide examples of how executing our strategy in both robust and challenging markets. As always, Laura will follow with a financial review of our businesses before we take your questions.
I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter record results including the sequential improvement from our record second quarter results. Our consistently strong financial performance in both the volatile global economy and tire industry is a testament to our strategy and, more importantly, our execution. We delivered outstanding earnings growth in the quarter, a record $599 million in segment operating income. When excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 25%, which is a clear indication that we executed against our strategy. Also, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 14%, the highest in more than 15 years despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in some of our key international markets. Each of our global businesses has segment operating margin of 11% or higher. By executing on a strategy roadmap, we're doing the right things to deliver strong quarterly results now the building capabilities for operable growth.
Our strong performance in North America continued in the third quarter. The business through a segment operating margin to more than 16% and achieved a 54% year-over-year increase in earnings driven by strong demand for a high-value added products. Its $323 million in segment operating income is a record for any quarter. Demand for our tires, particularly our premium HVA products, remains strong in North America as overall volume increased about 3% in the quarter. The consistent strength of our North America business is a result of our unwavering commitment to a strategy built to an alignment and integration of our industry-leading products developed from the market back, our aligned distribution network, our operational excellence initiatives and the power of the Goodyear brand. Together, they create a value proposition that differentiates us from the competition. When we executed at the intersection of these attributes, we win with consumers, we help our customers win in their markets and we create competitive advantage that is reflected in our results. As we progress with the execution of our strategy, we will take advantage of our brand strength with further high-profile initiatives to support our more driven campaign. We will continue to build on our NASCAR and ESPN relationships and leverage our new fleet of Goodyear blimps as I'm sure you've seen with our increased questions on football this season. The results of our ads have been terrific and have exceeded our expectations.
Also, we continue to roll out our e-commerce platform enabling consumers to research and buy tires online and have them installed to our network of aligned retailers. With more than 4,000 installers now signed up, we continue to expand our reach with this program, which is aimed at making the tire-buying process easier and creating value for Goodyear for our participating distributors and, of course, for our consumers. Since we initiated our e-commerce strategy earlier this year, others have taken similar steps, which certainly confirms our strategy. We remain very confident in our approach, which links the Goodyear brand the #1 search brand in the U.S, our participating Goodyear dealers and our aligned distributions all to benefit the consumers. We believe the combination of these attributes will be very hard to match. 
Regarding industry demand. We expected to continue to mix up for premium products. We welcome this trend as meeting the needs of the most discerning customers plays to our strength. In the near term, we are working to overcome our capacity constraints. As back orders remain for our premium products, we continue to strengthen our supply rubber operational excellence initiatives to get more tires out of our factories, through investment in our North American plants and through sourcing products from our global footprint. Additionally, the recent weakness in emerging market tire demand provide us with an opportunity to further leverage our international footprint to meet the strong demand for our products in the U.S.
Overall, this was another terrific quarter for North America's journey towards sustainable performance and value creation. Our goal is to maximize our ability to win at the intersection of innovation, demand creation and supply, all to better serve our customers and consumers. We've made some tremendous progress, but I know we can do even better. 
In our EMEA business, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar and soft winter tire sales explain the vast majority of the year-over-year decline in the region's results. We anticipated a weak industry environment, and it was even weaker than expected as winter tire inventory remained higher. Given 3 consecutive warm winters, there was little motivation for the channel to stock up on winter tires during the traditional selling season. On the positive side, our product portfolio remains robust, putting us in a strong position when consumers begin to switch to winter tires. Our industry-leading innovative new products continue to be recognized and influential magazine tests. The new Goodyear vector 4 season, our All-Season Tire, was the winner in an extensive test by a leading German automotive magazine and was the only tire that was tested to achieve the top exemplary rating. The vector 4 season was the clear winner. 
The Goodyear ultra-grip performance winter tire took first place in 3 magazine tests during the quarter, and the Dumlop winter sport 5 claimed the top spot in 2 tests. The results of these tests influence consumer buying behavior, and we're very pleased with the independent validation of our innovative winter products. Beyond the recognition for our winter tires, another positive was a 6% increase in our original equipment volume as the OE industry gained momentum in the third quarter. And in our commercial truck tire business, we continue to deliver strong results with numerous key competitive fleet wins as our fleet service value proposition, including our top-performing Goodyear Kmac tire lineup is demonstrating competitive advantage. We remain focused on building our value proposition and supporting our business over the long term with investments to deliver more premium products across the region. You may have seen our announcement in the quarter related to our plant modernization in our factory in South America converting to the latest technology to further improve the plant's high-value-added consumer car tire production. Looking ahead, we'll work to strengthen our distribution and customer service to help further differentiate our value proposition while also continuing to reduce our cost through an array of initiatives targeting increased profitability for EMEA business. We expect EMEA to be in a low growth environment and to have a weak euro for the near future, and our focus is on executing in that environment.
Market conditions in our Latin America business continued to be extremely challenging. The high level of volatility in the region is not new, and our leadership team continue to execute on our strategy and take advantage of pockets of activity. For example, even of our consumer in consumer in truck businesses remained weak in the region, particularly in Brazil, our consumer placement volume grew 22%. This was the foundation of our 8% overall volume growth. I'm pleased with our team's ability to execute our strategy under these adverse conditions. We will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the economic slowdown in Brazil to continue through 2016 and possibly beyond. We also are very focused on reacting quickly to the fast-moving swings and inflation and devaluations to ensure we are proactively managing our value proposition, our costs and our balance sheet position. As you heard me say before, this region will continue to be volatile, but we are well versed in executing in this environment. 
In Asia Pacific, our segment operating margin grew to more than 15% despite flat volume growth overall in the quarter. We face the weakening market environment in China in the third quarter as the economic slowdown, stock market decline and tighter liquidity negatively affect the consumers, retailers and the distributors' purchases. We have strong growth in a consumer business in India but also had continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that country. In China, new car sales declined significantly in the past months and credit in the distribution channel tightened as well. Despite these adverse market conditions, we grew our unit sales by 4% in the quarter based on our strong market position and our winning product lineup. More recently, the industry began to stabilize in September, and we are encouraged by the announced reduction in sales tax related to new vehicle purchases starting this month. While we expect continued volatility in China, we remain positive on the long-term market outlook and project the country's growing middle-class will drive improvement in the automotive sector. We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth as the Goodyear brand was recently ranked highest for consumer satisfaction in the luxury and SUV segments. Our EfficientGrip performance tire won several important awards in the quarter, including Motor Trend Magazine's Tire of the Year in the comfort category for the second year in a row. Also, we continue to win key OE fitments with both global and domestic automakers creating aftermarket pull. 
To meet our growth in the region, we're committed to increasing our capacity over the long term in our factory in China. With our announced and planned projects, we expect capacity by up to 5 million additional consumer HVA tires by 2020. We are very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, OE pull-through and increasing point of distributions will be supported by our increased capacity and give us confidence that we will continue to be successful in 1 of our most important markets.
Looking back in the third quarter, I'm very pleased with our record results. More importantly, I'm very happy with the way we continue to execute our strategy whether in strong markets or challenging ones. Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day while taking a long view of creating sustainable value. Given our results to 3 quarters, the strong demand for high-value added products and our balance of investments and cost reduction, I'm confident that our ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth in 2015 and 2016. With our strong year-to-date performance, we now see full year segment operating income tracking to $2 billion, which will be more than double to what we see achieved just 5 years ago. 
Our North America business continues to be the cornerstone of our earnings generation. Our international businesses, however, are operating in very difficult low growth environment driven by low commodity prices, weakening economies and weakening currencies versus the U.S. dollar. We do not anticipate that changing in 2016. Still, we are maintaining flexibility to deliver on our long-term strategy while being prudent and an proactive with our costs in the near term. In all businesses, we are delivering innovative new products and investing where appropriate for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."
275789,314320252,885167,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone.

My remarks today will start with a review of our third quarter results, including points from each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 15%. Our strong performance in a challenging international environment was driven by a combination of volume growth and margin expansion. Segment operating income was $599 million, and our SOI margin expanded to 14.3%. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter driven by solid growth in Latin America and North America, partially offset by decline in EMEA and Asia was essentially flat. The decline our net sales for the quarter is fully explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and reduced sales and other tire-related businesses primarily due to the fact of lower commodity prices impacting our third party chemical sales in North America. Strong performance on price/mix versus raw material improved our gross margin by 3.8 points to 28.3%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.99. The results were influenced by certain significant items, which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was also $0.99 as the adjustments collectively offset each other. As a result of the release of our U.S. tax evaluation allowances at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the previous quarter, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.29, up $0.42 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years.
The step chart on Slide 9 walks third quarter 2014 segment operating income to third quarter 2015. Our segment operating income was up 15% year-over-year and excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation grew 25%. The positive impact of volume growth was partially offset by lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs of $3 million. We were able to realize the benefit of lower raw material costs while holding price/mix essentially flat for a net benefit of $130 million during the quarter. While year-on-year prices declined slightly in part due to our raw material index agreements, that reduction was almost entirely offset by positive mix. Excluding Venezuela, our net price/mix versus raw material benefit in the quarter was $44 million. The $86 million impact of Venezuela was higher than we anticipated as we were able to offset higher-than-expected inflation. Our $76 million of cost savings was completely offset by the impact of inflation, including hyper inflation in Venezuela. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have been $55 million during the quarter. This is more reflective of our progress and operational excellence initiatives throughout the rest of the company. It is important to note that our performance, excluding Venezuela, is in line with our net cost savings in recent years. The impact of Venezuela is embedded in each element of our SOI walk, as always. But in aggregate, Venezuela accounted for $39 million of our SOI in the quarter and $12 million of the year-on-year growth in SOI. 
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $49 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the euro and the Canadian dollar. The translation impact of the Brazilian real was muted due to the weak business results of the continuing recession in Brazil. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion and is consistent with the prior quarter and the third quarter last year. This cash balance includes $292 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the third quarter. Our total debt and our net debt are both down slightly from the second quarter balances. Net debt is lower than the third quarter last year by $801 million following our strong free cash flow performance over the last 12 months. 
Slide 11 shows we generated $198 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Our normal seasonal building working capital was the use of $231 million, down significantly from last year's level driven by lower raw material costs. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.2 billion.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America continues to post impressive results recording the 25th conservative quarter of year-over-year earnings growth with segment operating income of $323 million. North America's $113 million improvement in earnings was driven primarily by strong price/mix net of raw material costs, increased volume from our consumer business and improved costs driven by our operational excellence initiatives. Partially offsetting these benefits, the weaker Canadian dollar negatively impacted North America's SOI by $12 million. The demand for our industry-leading consumer tires is strong as we realized consumer volume gains of 4%. During the quarter, we increase our share in OE, which continues to enhance our profitability, with increased sales of our premium HVA products such as the Wrangler all-terrain adventure and the Fuel Max on some of the OEMs most popular vehicles. Demand in our replacement business remained solid, and we continue to see benefits from our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. However, in many instances strong demand is outpacing our ability to supply our premium Goodyear branded tires. Through September, North America has delivered segment operating income of $842 million or about 14% to sale and we are on track to exceed $1 billion this year. We believe these results are continued evidence that our strategy is found, and our team's execution has been outstanding. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $154 million in the quarter, which was $27 million last than the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by currency weakness as foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $24 million. Overall, our EMEA unit volume decreased about 2% year-over-year. The European winter tire industry selling during the quarter during decreased more than 7% year-over-year. Although we did see year-over-year share increases in the winner HVA performance and SUV segments. Summer industry volumes were up 4% during the quarter, which helped offset some of these declines as well as weakness in parts of Eastern Europe, where we have been experiencing an increase in competition from Chinese imports. Our EMEA business has continued to deliver a solid underlying performance in 2015. We have seen cold weather and even still in some countries in October, we continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year, but the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segment.
Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $72 million in the quarter, a decrease of 10% versus last year's $80 million. The main driver to a foreign currency headwinds due to the stronger U.S. dollar and higher SAT expense, partially offset by favorable price/mix versus raw material cost. The segment operating margin in the region increased to 15.7%. Despite recent economic headwinds in China, our team has been performing well and growing our volume. Our OE business delivered double-digit volume growth in the quarter despite the weakness in the industry. In replacement, we did see an impact from destocking in our distributor channel, and we also made some choices based on customer credit both related to the title liquidity environment. Asia remains a key growth for the company, and we are confident about the region's long-term growth trajectory. We are prepared for short-term volatility and remain committed to mid- and long-term growth. In Latin America, segment operating income was $50 million for the quarter. Latin America benefited from higher volume and positive price/mix, which more than offset the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs. Our volume increased 8%, driven by 18% growth in our replacement business with double-digit growth in most countries in the region including Brazil, Mexico and the on beyond countries as a result of our strong product lineup. The OE business declined 21% due to the continuing recessionary environment in Brazil. As I mentioned earlier, for the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $39 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency change losses related to the Venezuelan Bolivar, which were $8 million in the quarter. While economic conditions and currency controls in Venezuela remain challenging, we received USD 15 million in the quarter to purchase raw materials to support continued operations. Our Latin American team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment, while at the same time taking actions to address the cost structure to be in a position to better weather the storm.
Slide 13 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume and unabsorbed overhead are unchanged from our July call. The first update is an increase in our outlook for price/mix net of raw material. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $370 million, which reflects an increase related to our third quarter performance. We continue to expect raw materials to be down about 7% versus 2014 before cost savings actions. This includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. With rapidly increasing inflation in Venezuela in the second half of the year, we revised our net cost savings in 2015 to be neutral. Outside of Venezuela, our businesses are delivering on our operational excellence initiatives. The savings, excluding Venezuela, are on plan and are delivering as expected. Our segment operating income drivers include about $20 million of earnings in Venezuela in the fourth quarter as we have sufficient U.S. dollars to enable us to produce through the end of the year.
We are taking a cautious view on Q4 as Venezuela has into its December collection, which could amplify the already volatile environment. Based on current spot rates, we now expect translation to be a headwind of $160 million for the full year. 
Finally, with our year-to-date strength in our other tire-related businesses, we've included a $20 million benefit in our outlook. In summary, as we look ahead and based on our current assumptions, we are tracking above our 10% to 15% segment operating income target for 2015 to $2 billion. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14 and reflect updates related to our year-to-date trends. The significant changes are reduction in our CapEx outlook to $1 billion to $1.1 billion and the likely need for $50 million to  75 million of working capital to support the business. Turning to 2016, we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth. We have strong positive momentum in many parts of our business and challenges in others. We will weigh all of these factors, including raw materials and foreign exchange. And provide our specific thoughts during our year-end earnings call. Finally, we continued to execute our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. Including the $30 million for repurchases during the third quarter, which essentially offset dilution, we repurchased $313 million under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We also recently announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share effective with our December dividend payment. Now we'll open the line up for your questions."

It's typically high-end tires and it's very good mix so forth. So it's very important to us. And as you know, we're a leader in winter technology. The situation that we're seeing is coming off of 3 warm winters in a row. As Laura mentioned, and I think we said in the past, we've kind of planned for that sort of pre-winter even though we're seeing some snow at this point. And part of what goes into our thinking is pretty much in line is what you're saying. You could almost call it the sort of the animal spirits of the winter or the channel in Europe right now particularly in Germany. They do have higher inventory in the channel right now. And on top of that, you had these 3 warm winter motivation to go stock up Angola line tires. The industry is typically around 100 million units something like that, if you do the math. We would say that with higher inventory in the channel, that's obviously still a question as to whether we can even reach that level. It's clearly been much higher than that if you go back to the white winters of 2011. It was actually much higher than what I'm saying. So as we look at it, we are going to continue to sort of stay in a cautious view. We think we're very well prepared for it. I went through with my remarks, our winter lineup. our ultra-great performance Tire art Dunlop winter sport 5, our vector for All-Season that wants to move though those who want to move it All-Season that the spot market but we have the top-tier winning podium products in all of those categories by now so we are ready. i think what would give us a boost, but again, they do see a boost, frankly, is cold weather and snow as we head into November here."

We are significantly ahead of others that what you say and we did that very consciously to greater demand in the marketplace back. Then we pulled together signing up our partner dealers and also putting the distribution capabilities in place and then marrying the technology to be able to make that work so customer has a good experience as we're doing this really to make the tire volume process easier for the consumer. What I said I said very simply but it's a very complex problem and it's 1 of those things that sort of bolt-ons don't necessarily make the process that much less friction because he got a hookup all kinds of things in the back. So this is not an easy thing to do to get the SKU explosion, to get the right tire at the right place at the right time with the consumers going online to buy that tires. This is not an easy process. And that's why we're being very methodical and having a good success as we go at this point. Having said that, I do think like most other products, and particularly around millennials being the consumers with $1 trillion buying power of some 80 million millennials out there that this will be an absolute way to buy tires and expected way to buy tires because that's how the group does commerce to a large degree. So having a formula that works out there and being able to marry it with a brand and importantly the distribution of both retailers and align distributors to get the tires there is going to be what wins and that's how we're thinking about it. So building it from the bottom-up to be able to deliver on that value promise and so far we feel very good about it. But there's no question it will be a way that consumers want to shop, and Goodyear and its partners, partner-leaders are getting ready for that."

Think the larger rim diameter, SBU tires, in particular were performance tires. Those are tires that remain high in demand. The capacity on those abroad basis still I would say is behind the the demand for those tires and that something we are working to continue to make more of and doing that by getting more tires our of our existing factories, investing in our North American factories and also using our sort of lower demands around the world to import some of those tires in. In the near term, that's how we're trying to catch up and continue to be a better supplier. Over the long term, that's also why we embarked on the Americas plant that we've talked on the past. So that's something that will take some time to put in place. It also is going to be a function of the demand that's out there as well we think that the demand will be there and we're going to work -- we are working feverishly to do that keeping our factories running full to be able to supply those tires. I would also say that though just to put it in perspective, that part of that market continues to grow. The other parts of the market, as we said, are always subject to these imports coming in. Remember we had visited the generations because buying ahead of tariffs and the like. And you have to remember that drives the market or has an impact in the market it impact us last as we're focused on other segments of the market and not so much with happening in the lower end. The question on the sustainability of North America's market -- excuse me -- margins. I would say as we look at the business today, we remain in the industry today. We remain very optimistic and positive and what's still available for us to go achieved. I just mentioned the demand for HVA tires out there. I made a few remarks earlier about the opportunities related to growing through digital and as we look at our business, the tires business is really 1 of execution. Right tire, right place, right time, creating the right demand and having the band to that brings consumers to the stores and to our participating dealers. By doing those things right, and as I've said, working and executing at the intersection of innovation of demand creation of supply, we see continued opportunity to continue our business.

This morning, I will review our record third quarter results, including our continued success in North America and provide examples of how we are executing our strategy in both robust and challenging markets. As always, Laura will follow with a financial review of our businesses before we take your questions.
I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter's record results, including the sequential improvement from our record second quarter results. Our consistently strong financial performance in both the volatile global economy and tire industry is a testament to our strategy and more importantly, our execution.
We delivered outstanding earnings growth in the quarter, a record $599 million in segment operating income. When excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 25%, which is a clear indication that we executed against our strategy.
Also, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 14%, the highest in more than 15 years despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in some of our key international markets. Each of our global businesses has segment operating margin of 11% or higher. By executing on a strategy road map, we're doing the right things to deliver strong quarterly results now while building capabilities for profitable growth.
Our strong performance in North America continued in the third quarter. The business grew its segment operating margin to more than 16% and achieved a 54% year-over-year increase in earnings, driven by strong demand for our high-value-added products. Its $323 million in segment operating income is a record for any quarter.
Demand for our tires, particularly our premium HVA products, remains strong in North America as overall volume increased about 3% in the quarter. The consistent strength of our North America business is a result of our unwavering commitment to a strategy built on the alignment and integration of our industry-leading products developed from the market back, our aligned distribution network, our operational excellence initiatives and the power of the Goodyear brand.
Together, they create a value proposition that differentiates us from the competition. When we execute at the intersection of these attributes, we win with consumers, we help our customers win in their markets and we create competitive advantage that is reflected in our results.
As we progress with the execution of our strategy, we will take advantage of our brand strength with further high-profile initiatives to support our more driven campaign. We will continue to build on our NASCAR and ESPN relationships and leverage our new fleet of Goodyear blimps as I'm sure you've seen with our increased presence on college football this season. The results of our ads have been terrific and have exceeded our expectations.
Also, we continue to roll out our e-commerce platform, enabling consumers to research and buy tires online and have them installed through our network of aligned retailers. With more than 4,000 installers now signed up, we continue to expand our reach with this program, which is aimed at making the tire-buying process easier and creating value for Goodyear, for our participating distributors and of course, for our consumers.
Since we initiated our e-commerce strategy earlier this year, others have taken similar steps, which certainly confirms our strategy. We remain very confident in our approach, which links the Goodyear brand the #1 search brand in the U.S., our participating Goodyear dealers and our aligned distribution, all to benefit the consumer. We believe the combination of these attributes will be very hard to match.
Regarding industry demand. We expect it to continue to mix up toward premium products. We welcome this trend as meeting the needs of the most discerning customers plays to our strength. In the near term, we are working to overcome our capacity constraints. As back orders remain for our premium products, we continue to strengthen our supply through our operational excellence initiatives to get more tires out of our factories, through investments in our North American plants and through sourcing products from our global footprint. Additionally, the recent weakness in emerging market tire demand provides us with an opportunity to further leverage our international footprint to meet the strong demand for our products in the U.S.
Overall, this was another terrific quarter for North America's journey towards sustainable performance and value creation. Our goal is to maximize our ability to win at the intersection of innovation, demand creation and supply, all to better serve our customers and consumers. We've made tremendous progress, but I know we can do even better.
In our EMEA business, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar and soft winter tire sales explain the vast majority of the year-over-year decline in the region's results. We anticipated a weak industry environment, and it was even weaker than expected as winter tire inventory remained high. Given 3 consecutive warm winters, there was little motivation for the channel to stock up on winter tires during the traditional sell-in season.
On the positive side, our product portfolio remains robust, putting us in a strong position when consumers begin to switch to winter tires. Our industry-leading innovative new products continue to be recognized in influential magazine tests. The new Goodyear Vector 4Seasons, our all season tire, was the winner in an extensive test by a leading German automotive magazine and was the only tire of the 10 that were tested to achieve the top exemplary rating. the vector 4Seasons was the clear winner.
The Goodyear Ultra Grip Performance winter tire took first place in 3 magazine tests during the quarter, and the Dunlop Winter Sport 5 claimed the top spot in 2 tests. The results of these tests influence consumer buying behavior, and we're very pleased with the independent validation of our innovative winter products.
Beyond the recognition for our winter tires, another positive was a 6% increase in our original equipment volume as the OE industry gained momentum in the third quarter. And in our commercial truck tire business, we continue to deliver strong results with numerous key competitive fleet wins as our fleet service value proposition, including our top-performing Goodyear KMAX tire lineup is demonstrating competitive advantage.
We will remain focused on building our value proposition and supporting our business over the long term with investments to deliver more premium products across the region. You may have seen our announcement in the quarter related to our planned modernization of our factory in South Africa, converting to the latest technology to further improve the plant's high-value-added consumer car tire production.
Looking ahead, we'll work to strengthen our distribution and customer service to help further differentiate our value proposition while also continuing to reduce our costs through an array of initiatives, targeting increased profitability for our EMEA business. We expect EMEA to be in a low growth environment and to have a weak euro for the near future, and our focus is on executing in that environment.
Market conditions in our Latin America business continued to be extremely challenging. The high level of volatility in the region is not new, and our leadership team continued to execute on our strategy and take advantage of pockets of opportunity. For example, even as our consumer OE in commercial truck businesses remained weak in the region, particularly in Brazil, our consumer placement volume grew 22%. This was the foundation of our 8% overall volume growth. I'm pleased with our team's ability to execute our strategy under these adverse conditions.
We will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the economic slowdown in Brazil to continue through 2016 and possibly beyond. We also are very focused on reacting quickly to the fast-moving swings in inflation and devaluations to ensure we are proactively managing our value proposition, our costs and our balance sheet position. As you've heard me say before, this region will continue to be volatile, but we are well versed in executing in this environment.
In Asia Pacific, our segment operating margin grew to more than 15% despite flat volume growth overall in the quarter. We face the weakening market environment in China in the third quarter as the economic slowdown, stock market decline and tighter liquidity negatively affected consumers, retailers and the distributors' purchases.
We had strong growth in our consumer business in India, but also had continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that country. In China, new car sales declined significantly in the past months and credit in the distribution channel tightened as well. Despite these adverse market conditions, we grew our unit sales by 4% in the quarter based on our strong market position and our winning product lineup.
More recently, the industry began to stabilize in September, and we are encouraged by the announced reduction in sales tax related to new vehicle purchases starting this month. While we expect continued volatility in China, we remain positive on the long-term market outlook and project the country's growing middle class will drive improvement in the automotive sector.
We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth as the Goodyear brand was recently ranked highest for consumer satisfaction in the luxury and SUV segments. Our EfficientGrip Performance tire won several important awards in the quarter, including Motor Trend Magazine's Tire of the Year in the comfort category for the second year in a row. Also, we continue to win key OE fitments with both global and domestic automakers, creating aftermarket pull.
To meet our growth in the region, we're committed to increasing our capacity over the long term in our factory in Pulandian, China. With our announced and planned projects, we expect to increase our capacity by up to 5 million additional consumer HVA tires by 2020. We are very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, OE pull-through and increasing points of distributions will be supported by our increased capacity and give us confidence that we will continue to be successful in one of our most important markets.
Looking back at the third quarter, I'm very pleased with our record results. More importantly, I'm very happy with the way we continue to execute our strategy, whether in strong markets or challenging ones. Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day while taking a long view of creating sustainable value.
Given our results to the 3 quarters, the strong demand for our high-value-added products and our balance of investments and cost reduction, I'm confident of our ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth in 2015 and 2016. With our strong year-to-date performance, we now see full year segment operating income tracking to $2 billion, which will be more than double what we achieved just 5 years ago.
Our North America business continues to be the cornerstone of our earnings generation. Our international businesses, however, are operating in very difficult low growth environments, driven by low commodity prices, weakening economies and weakening currencies versus the U.S. dollar. We do not anticipate that changing in 2016.
Still, we are maintaining flexibility to deliver on our long-term strategy while being prudent and proactive with our costs in the near term. In all businesses, we are delivering innovative new products and investing where appropriate for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our third quarter results, including points from each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 15%. Our strong performance in a challenging international environment was driven by a combination of volume growth and margin expansion. Segment operating income was $599 million, and our SOI margin expanded to 14.3%.
Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in Latin America and North America, partially offset by decline in EMEA and Asia was essentially flat. The decline our net sales for the quarter is fully explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and reduced sales and other tire-related businesses, primarily due to the effect of lower commodity prices impacting our third party chemical sales in North America.
Strong performance on price/mix versus raw materials improved our gross margin by 3.8 points to 28.3%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.99. The results were influenced by certain significant items, which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was also $0.99 as the adjustments collectively offset each other.
As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowances at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the previous quarters, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS, excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.29, up $0.42 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years.
The step chart on Slide 9 walks third quarter 2014 segment operating income to third quarter 2015. Our segment operating income was up 15% year-over-year and excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, grew 25%. The positive impact of volume growth was partially offset by lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs of $3 million.
We were able to realize the benefit of lower raw material costs while holding price/mix essentially flat for a net benefit of $130 million during the quarter. While year-on-year prices declined slightly in part due to our raw material indexed agreements, that reduction was almost entirely offset by positive mix. Excluding Venezuela, our net price/mix versus raw material benefit in the quarter was $44 million. The $86 million impact of Venezuela was higher than we anticipated as we were able to offset higher-than-expected inflation.
Our $76 million of cost savings was completely offset by the impact of inflation, including hyperinflation in Venezuela. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have been $55 million during the quarter. This is more reflective of our progress on operational excellence initiatives throughout the rest of the company.
It is important to note that our performance, excluding Venezuela, is in line with our net cost savings in recent years. The impact of Venezuela is embedded in each element of our SOI walk, as always. But in aggregate, Venezuela accounted for $39 million of our SOI in the quarter and $12 million of the year-on-year growth in SOI.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $49 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro and the Canadian dollar. The translation impact of the Brazilian real was muted due to weak business results from the continuing recession in Brazil.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion and is consistent with the prior quarter and the third quarter last year. This cash balance includes $292 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the third quarter. Our total debt and our net debt are both down slightly from the second quarter balances. Net debt is lower than the third quarter last year by $801 million, following our strong free cash flow performance over the last 12 months.
Slide 11 shows we generated $198 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Our normal seasonal build and working capital was a use of $231 million, down significantly from last year's level, driven by lower raw material costs. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.2 billion.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America continues to post impressive results, recording the 25th conservative quarter of year-over-year earnings growth with segment operating income of $323 million. North America's $113 million improvement in earnings was driven primarily by strong price/mix net of raw material costs, increased volume from our consumer business and improved costs, driven by our operational excellence initiatives.
Partially offsetting these benefits, the weaker Canadian dollar negatively impacted North America's SOI by $12 million. The demand for our industry-leading consumer tires is strong as we realized consumer volume gains of 4%. During the quarter, we increase our share in OE, which continues to enhance our profitability with increased sales of our premium HVA products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and Assurance Fuel Max on some of the OEMs' most popular vehicles.
Demand in our replacement business remained solid, and we continue to see benefits from our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. However, in many instances, strong demand is outpacing our ability to supply our premium Goodyear-branded tires. Through September, North America has delivered segment operating income of $842 million or about 14% to sale, and we are on track to exceed $1 billion this year. We believe these results are continued evidence that our strategy is found and our team's execution has been outstanding.
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $154 million in the quarter, which was $27 million less than the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by currency weakness as foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $24 million. Overall, our EMEA unit volume decreased about 2% year-over-year. The European winter tire industry sell-in during the quarter decreased more than 7% year-over-year, although we did see year-over-year share increases in the winner HVA performance and SUV segments.
Summer industry volumes were up 4% during the quarter, which helped offset some of this decline as well as weakness in parts of Eastern Europe, where we have been experiencing an increase in competition from Chinese imports. Our EMEA business has continued to deliver solid underlying performance in 2015. While we have seen cold weather and even snow in some countries in October, we continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year, but the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segment.
Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $72 million in the quarter, a decrease of 10% versus last year's $80 million. The main drivers were foreign currency headwinds due to the stronger U.S. dollar and higher SAT expense, partially offset by favorable price/mix versus raw material cost. The segment operating margin in the region increased to 15.7%.
Despite recent economic headwinds in China, our team has been performing well and growing our volume. Our OE business delivered double-digit volume growth in the quarter despite the weakness in the industry. In replacement, we did see an impact from destocking in our distributor channel, and we also made some choices based on customer credit, both related to the tighter liquidity environment.
Asia remains a key growth opportunity for the company, and we are confident about the region's long-term growth trajectory. We are prepared for short-term volatility and remain committed to mid- and long-term growth.
In Latin America, segment operating income was $50 million for the quarter. Latin America benefited from higher volume and positive price/mix, which more than offset the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs. Our volume increased 8%, driven by 18% growth in our replacement business, with double-digit growth in most countries in the region, including Brazil, Mexico and the on beyond [ph] countries, as a result of our strong product lineup. The OE business declined 21% due to the continuing recessionary environment in Brazil.
As I mentioned earlier, for the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $39 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency change losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar, which were $8 million in the quarter. While economic conditions and currency controls in Venezuela remain challenging, we received USD 15 million in the quarter to purchase raw materials to support continued operations.
Our Latin American team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment, while at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to be in a position to better weather the storm.
Slide 13 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume and unabsorbed overhead are unchanged from our July call. The first update is an increase in our outlook for price/mix net of raw materials. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $370 million, which reflects an increase related to our third quarter performance. We continue to expect raw materials to be down about 7% versus 2014 before cost savings actions. This includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.
With rapidly increasing inflation in Venezuela in the second half of the year, we revised our net cost savings in 2015 to be neutral. Outside of Venezuela, our businesses are delivering on our operational excellence initiatives. The savings, excluding Venezuela, are on plan and are delivering as expected. Our segment operating income drivers include about $20 million of earnings in Venezuela in the fourth quarter as we have sufficient U.S. dollars to enable us to produce through the end of the year.
We are taking a cautious view on Q4 as Venezuela heads into its December election, which could amplify the already volatile environment. Based on current spot rates, we now expect translation to be a headwind of $160 million for the full year.
Finally, with our year-to-date strength in our other tire-related businesses, we've included a $20 million benefit in our outlook. In summary, as we look ahead and based on our current assumptions, we are tracking above our 10% to 15% segment operating income target for 2015 to $2 billion.
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14 and reflect updates related to our year-to-date trends. The significant changes are a reduction in our CapEx outlook to $1 billion to $1.1 billion and the likely need for $50 million to $75 million of working capital to support the business.
Turning to 2016, we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth. We have strong positive momentum in many parts of our business and challenges in others. We will weigh all these factors, including raw materials and foreign exchange, and provide our specific thoughts during our year-end earnings call.
Finally, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. Including the $30 million for repurchases during the third quarter, which essentially offset dilution, we've repurchased $313 million under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We also recently announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share, effective with our December dividend payment.

It's typically high-end tires and it's very good mix, so forth. So it's very important to us. And as you know, we're a leader in winter technology. The situation that we're seeing, as you know, coming off of 3 warm winters in a row, and as Laura mentioned and I think as we said in the past, we've kind of planned for that sort of green winter even though we've seen some snow at this point. And part of what goes into our thinking is pretty much in line is what you're saying. You can almost call it the sort of the animal spirits of the winter or the channel in Europe right now, particularly in Germany. They do have higher inventory in the channel right now. And on top of that, you've had these 3 warm winters, so there's little motivation to go stock up and go long on tires. The industry is typically around 100 million units, something like that, if you do the math. We would say that with higher inventory in the channel, that's obviously still a question as to whether it can even reach that level. It's clearly been much higher than that if you go back to the white winters of 2011. It was actually much higher than what I'm saying. So as we look at it, we are going to continue to sort of stay in a cautious view. We think we're very well prepared for it. I went through on my remarks, our winter lineup, our Ultra Grip Performance tire, our Dunlop Winter Sport 5, our Vector for all season for those that want to move to all season that's a small market. But we have top-tier winning podium products in all of those categories right now, so we're ready. I think what would give us a boost, what would give the industry a boost, frankly, is cold weather and snow as we head into November here."

And I think that's important. That's what we saw coming. It's why we did what we did. And I would tell you, we took a long time in getting there, building up what you've heard me say, our brand and building up search on our brand. We're the #1 searched tire brand, tire manufacturer in the U.S., rivaling some other big online tire sellers right now and doing that as a manufacturer. We are significantly ahead of our -- of others, let's just say. And we did that very consciously to create the demand in the marketplace. Then we pulled together signing up our partner dealers and also putting the distribution capabilities in place and then marrying the technology to be able to make that work so a customer has a good experience as we're doing this really to make the tire buying process easier for the consumer. What I said, I said very simply, but it's a very complex problem. And it's one of those things that sort of bolt-ons don't necessarily make the process that less -- have that much less friction and it's because you got to hook up all kinds of things in the back. So this is not an easy thing to do to get the SKU explosion, to get the right tire to the right place at the right time when a consumer is going online to buy that tire. So this is not an easy process, and it's why we're being very methodical in having a good success as we go at this point. Having said that, I do think, like most other products and particularly around millennials being the consumers with $1 trillion of buying power with some 80 million millennials out there, that this will be an absolute way to buy tires, an expected way to buy tires because that's how that group does commerce to a large degree. So having a formula that works out there and being able to marry it with the brand and importantly, the distribution, both retailers and aligned distributors to get the tires there, is going to be what wins and that's how we're thinking about it, sort of building it from the bottom up to be able to deliver on that value promise. And so far, we feel very good about it. But there's no question, it will be a way that consumers want to shop, and Goodyear and its partners, partner dealers are getting ready for that."

So the first question on the way to catch up on supply, I would tell you, this is a point that we've been making relative to supplying those high-end HVA complex tires. Think the larger rim diameter, SVU tires, in particular, were performance tires. And those are tires that remain high in demand. The capacity for those tires, on a broad basis, still, I would say, is behind the demand for those tires. And that's something we are working to continue to make more of and doing that by getting more tires out of our existing factories, investing in our North American factories and also using our sort of lower demands around the world to import some of those tires in. So in the near term, that's how we're trying to catch up and continue to be a better supplier. Over the long term, that's also why we embarked on the Americas plant that we've talked on in the past. So that's something that will take some time to put in place. It also is going to be a function of the demand that's out there as well. We think that the demand will be there, and we're going to work -- we are working feverishly to do that, keeping our factories running full to be able to supply those tires. I would also say though, just to put it in perspective, that part of that market continues to grow. The other parts of the market, as we said, are always subject to these imports coming in. Remember, we had these big gyrations because buying ahead of tariffs and the like. And you have to remember, as that drives the market or has an impact on the market, it has -- it impacts us less as we're focused on other segments of the market and not so much what's happening in the lower end. The question on the sustainability of North America's market -- excuse me, margins, I would say, as we look at the business today, we remain -- the industry today, we remain very optimistic and positive on what's still available for us to go achieve. I just mentioned the demand for HVA tires out there. I made a few remarks earlier about the opportunities related to growing through digital. And as we look at our business, the tire business is really one of execution. Right tire, right place, right time, creating the right demand and having a brand that brings consumers to the stores and to our participating dealers. By doing those things right, and as I said, working and executing at the intersection of innovation of demand creation and of supply, we see continued opportunity to continue to grow our business. So we as we look at the earnings power of North America and we look at the industry conditions out there, I still remain very confident in the ability -- in the earnings ability of our North America business."

This morning, I will review our record third quarter results, including our continued success in North America and provide examples of how we are executing our strategy in both robust and challenging markets. As always, Laura will follow with a financial review of our businesses before we take your questions.
I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter's record results, including the sequential improvement from our record second quarter results. Our consistently strong financial performance in both the volatile global economy and tire industry is a testament to our strategy and more importantly, our execution.
We delivered outstanding earnings growth in the quarter, a record $599 million in segment operating income. When excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 25%, which is a clear indication that we executed against our strategy.
Also, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 14%, the highest in more than 15 years, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in some of our key international markets. Each of our global businesses has segment operating margin of 11% or higher. By executing on a strategy road map, we're doing the right things to deliver strong quarterly results now while building capabilities for profitable growth.
Our strong performance in North America continued in the third quarter. The business grew its segment operating margin to more than 16% and achieved a 54% year-over-year increase in earnings, driven by strong demand for our high-value-added products. Its $323 million in segment operating income is a record for any quarter.
Demand for our tires, particularly our premium HVA products, remains strong in North America as overall volume increased about 3% in the quarter. The consistent strength of our North America business is a result of our unwavering commitment to a strategy built on the alignment and integration of our industry-leading products developed from the market back, our aligned distribution network, our operational excellence initiatives and the power of the Goodyear brand.
Together, they create a value proposition that differentiates us from the competition. When we execute at the intersection of these attributes, we win with consumers, we help our customers win in their markets and we create competitive advantage that is reflected in our results.
As we progress with the execution of our strategy, we will take advantage of our brand strength with further high-profile initiatives to support our more driven campaign. We will continue to build on our NASCAR and ESPN relationships and leverage our new fleet of Goodyear blimps as I'm sure you've seen with our increased presence on college football this season. The results of our ads have been terrific and have exceeded our expectations.
Also, we continue to roll out our e-commerce platform, enabling consumers to research and buy tires online and have them installed through our network of aligned retailers. With more than 4,000 installers now signed up, we continue to expand our reach with this program, which is aimed at making the tire-buying process easier and creating value for Goodyear, for our participating distributors and of course, for our consumers.
Since we initiated our e-commerce strategy earlier this year, others have taken similar steps, which certainly confirms our strategy. We remain very confident in our approach, which links the Goodyear brand the #1 search brand in the U.S., our participating Goodyear dealers and our aligned distribution, all to benefit the consumer. We believe the combination of these attributes will be very hard to match.
Regarding industry demand. We expect it to continue to mix up toward premium products. We welcome this trend as meeting the needs of the most discerning customers plays to our strength. In the near term, we are working to overcome our capacity constraints. As back orders remain for our premium products, we continue to strengthen our supply through our operational excellence initiatives to get more tires out of our factories, through investments in our North American plants and through sourcing products from our global footprint. Additionally, the recent weakness in emerging market tire demand provides us with an opportunity to further leverage our international footprint to meet the strong demand for our products in the U.S.
Overall, this was another terrific quarter for North America's journey towards sustainable performance and value creation. Our goal is to maximize our ability to win at the intersection of innovation, demand creation and supply, all to better serve our customers and consumers. We've made tremendous progress, but I know we can do even better.
In our EMEA business, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar and soft winter tire sales explain the vast majority of the year-over-year decline in the region's results. We anticipated a weak industry environment, and it was even weaker than expected as winter tire inventory remained high. Given 3 consecutive warm winters, there was little motivation for the channel to stock up on winter tires during the traditional sell-in season.
On the positive side, our product portfolio remains robust, putting us in a strong position when consumers begin to switch to winter tires. Our industry-leading innovative new products continue to be recognized in influential magazine tests. The new Goodyear Vector 4Seasons, our all season tire, was the winner in an extensive test by a leading German automotive magazine and was the only tire of the 10 that were tested to achieve the top exemplary rating. The vector 4Seasons was the clear winner.
The Goodyear Ultra Grip Performance winter tire took first place in 3 magazine tests during the quarter, and the Dunlop Winter Sport 5 claimed the top spot in 2 tests. The results of these tests influence consumer buying behavior, and we're very pleased with the independent validation of our innovative winter products.
Beyond the recognition for our winter tires, another positive was a 6% increase in our original equipment volume as the OE industry gained momentum in the third quarter. And in our commercial truck tire business, we continue to deliver strong results with numerous key competitive fleet wins as our fleet service value proposition, including our top-performing Goodyear KMAX tire lineup is demonstrating competitive advantage.
We will remain focused on building our value proposition and supporting our business over the long term with investments to deliver more premium products across the region. You may have seen our announcement in the quarter related to our planned modernization of our factory in South Africa, converting to the latest technology to further improve the plant's high-value-added consumer car tire production.
Looking ahead, we'll work to strengthen our distribution and customer service to help further differentiate our value proposition while also continuing to reduce our costs through an array of initiatives, targeting increased profitability for our EMEA business. We expect EMEA to be in a low growth environment and to have a weak euro for the near future, and our focus is on executing in that environment.
Market conditions in our Latin America business continued to be extremely challenging. The high level of volatility in the region is not new, and our leadership team continued to execute on our strategy and take advantage of pockets of opportunity. For example, even as our consumer OE in commercial truck businesses remained weak in the region, particularly in Brazil, our consumer placement volume grew 22%. This was the foundation of our 8% overall volume growth. I'm pleased with our team's ability to execute our strategy under these adverse conditions.
We will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the economic slowdown in Brazil to continue through 2016 and possibly beyond. We also are very focused on reacting quickly to the fast-moving swings in inflation and devaluations to ensure we are proactively managing our value proposition, our costs and our balance sheet position. As you've heard me say before, this region will continue to be volatile, but we are very well versed in executing in this environment.
In Asia Pacific, our segment operating margin grew to more than 15% despite flat volume growth overall in the quarter. We face the weakening market environment in China in the third quarter as the economic slowdown, stock market decline and tighter liquidity negatively affected consumers, retailers and the distributors' purchases.
We had strong growth in our consumer business in India, but also had continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that country. In China, new car sales declined significantly in the past months and credit in the distribution channel tightened as well. Despite these adverse market conditions, we grew our unit sales by 4% in the quarter based on our strong market position and our winning product lineup.
More recently, the industry began to stabilize in September, and we are encouraged by the announced reduction in sales tax related to new vehicle purchases starting this month. While we expect continued volatility in China, we remain positive on the long-term market outlook and project the country's growing middle class will drive improvement in the automotive sector.
We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth as the Goodyear brand was recently ranked highest for consumer satisfaction in the luxury and SUV segments. Our EfficientGrip Performance tire won several important awards in the quarter, including Motor Trend Magazine's Tire of the Year in the comfort category for the second year in a row. Also, we continue to win key OE fitments with both global and domestic automakers, creating aftermarket pull.
To meet our growth in the region, we're committed to increasing our capacity over the long term in our factory in Pulandian, China. With our announced and planned projects, we expect to increase our capacity by up to 5 million additional consumer HVA tires by 2020. We are very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, OE pull-through and increasing points of distributions will be supported by our increased capacity and give us confidence that we will continue to be successful in one of our most important markets.
Looking back at the third quarter, I'm very pleased with our record results. More importantly, I'm very happy with the way we continue to execute our strategy, whether in strong markets or challenging ones. Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day while taking a long view of creating sustainable value.
Given our results to the 3 quarters, the strong demand for our high-value-added products and our balance of investments and cost reduction, I'm confident of our ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth in 2015 and 2016. With our strong year-to-date performance, we now see full year segment operating income tracking to $2 billion, which will be more than double what we achieved just 5 years ago.
Our North America business continues to be the cornerstone of our earnings generation. Our international businesses, however, are operating in very difficult low growth environments, driven by low commodity prices, weakening economies and weakening currencies versus the U.S. dollar. We do not anticipate that changing in 2016.
Still, we are maintaining flexibility to deliver on our long-term strategy while being prudent and proactive with our costs in the near term. In all businesses, we are delivering innovative new products and investing where appropriate for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our third quarter results, including points from each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 15%. Our strong performance in a challenging international environment was driven by a combination of volume growth and margin expansion. Segment operating income was $599 million, and our SOI margin expanded to 14.3%.
Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in Latin America and North America, partially offset by decline in EMEA and Asia was essentially flat. The decline our net sales for the quarter is fully explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and reduced sales in other tire-related businesses, primarily due to the effect of lower commodity prices impacting our third party chemical sales in North America.
Strong performance on price/mix versus raw materials improved our gross margin by 3.8 points to 28.3%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.99. The results were influenced by certain significant items, which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was also $0.99 as the adjustments collectively offset each other.
As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowances at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the previous quarters, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS, excluding this incremental noncash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.29, up $0.42 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately 5 years.
The step chart on Slide 9 walks third quarter 2014 segment operating income to third quarter 2015. Our segment operating income was up 15% year-over-year and excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, grew 25%. The positive impact of volume growth was partially offset by lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs of $3 million.
We were able to realize the benefit of lower raw material costs while holding price/mix essentially flat for a net benefit of $130 million during the quarter. While year-on-year prices declined slightly in part due to our raw material indexed agreements, that reduction was almost entirely offset by positive mix. Excluding Venezuela, our net price/mix versus raw material benefit in the quarter was $44 million. The $86 million impact of Venezuela was higher than we anticipated as we were able to offset higher-than-expected inflation.
Our $76 million of cost savings was completely offset by the impact of inflation, including hyperinflation in Venezuela. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have been $55 million during the quarter. This is more reflective of our progress on operational excellence initiatives throughout the rest of the company.
It is important to note that our performance, excluding Venezuela, is in line with our net cost savings in recent years. The impact of Venezuela is embedded in each element of our SOI walk, as always. But in aggregate, Venezuela accounted for $39 million of our SOI in the quarter and $12 million of the year-on-year growth in SOI.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $49 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro and the Canadian dollar. The translation impact of the Brazilian real was muted due to weak business results from the continuing recession in Brazil.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion and is consistent with the prior quarter and the third quarter last year. This cash balance includes $292 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the third quarter. Our total debt and our net debt are both down slightly from the second quarter balances. Net debt is lower than the third quarter last year by $801 million, following our strong free cash flow performance over the last 12 months.
Slide 11 shows we generated $198 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Our normal seasonal build in working capital was a use of $231 million, down significantly from last year's level, driven by lower raw material costs. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong, exceeding $1.2 billion.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 12. North America continues to post impressive results, recording the 25th conservative quarter of year-over-year earnings growth with segment operating income of $323 million. North America's $113 million improvement in earnings was driven primarily by strong price/mix net of raw material costs, increased volume from our consumer business and improved costs, driven by our operational excellence initiatives.
Partially offsetting these benefits, the weaker Canadian dollar negatively impacted North America's SOI by $12 million. The demand for our industry-leading consumer tires is strong as we realized consumer volume gains of 4%. During the quarter, we increase our share in OE, which continues to enhance our profitability with increased sales of our premium HVA products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and Assurance Fuel Max on some of the OEMs' most popular vehicles.
Demand in our replacement business remained solid, and we continue to see benefits from our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. However, in many instances, strong demand is outpacing our ability to supply our premium Goodyear-branded tires. Through September, North America has delivered segment operating income of $842 million or about 14% to sale, and we are on track to exceed $1 billion this year. We believe these results are continued evidence that our strategy is sound and our team's execution has been outstanding.
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $154 million in the quarter, which was $27 million less than the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by currency weakness as foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $24 million. Overall, our EMEA unit volume decreased about 2% year-over-year. The European winter tire industry sell-in during the quarter decreased more than 7% year-over-year, although we did see year-over-year share increases in the winter HVA performance and SUV segments.
Summer industry volumes were up 4% during the quarter, which helped offset some of this decline as well as weakness in parts of Eastern Europe, where we have been experiencing an increase in competition from Chinese imports. Our EMEA business has continued to deliver solid underlying performance in 2015. While we have seen cold weather and even snow in some countries in October, we continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year, but the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segment.
Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $72 million in the quarter, a decrease of 10% versus last year's $80 million. The main drivers were foreign currency headwinds due to the stronger U.S. dollar and higher SAT expense, partially offset by favorable price/mix versus raw material cost. The segment operating margin in the region increased to 15.7%.
Despite recent economic headwinds in China, our team has been performing well and growing our volume. Our OE business delivered double-digit volume growth in the quarter despite the weakness in the industry. In replacement, we did see an impact from destocking in our distributor channel, and we also made some choices based on customer credit, both related to the tighter liquidity environment.
Asia remains a key growth opportunity for the company, and we are confident about the region's long-term growth trajectory. We are prepared for short-term volatility and remain committed to mid- and long-term growth.
In Latin America, segment operating income was $50 million for the quarter. Latin America benefited from higher volume and positive price/mix, which more than offset the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs. Our volume increased 8%, driven by 18% growth in our replacement business, with double-digit growth in most countries in the region, including Brazil, Mexico and the Andean countries, as a result of our strong product lineup. The OE business declined 21% due to the continuing recessionary environment in Brazil.
As I mentioned earlier, for the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $39 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar, which were $8 million in the quarter. While economic conditions and currency controls in Venezuela remain challenging, we received USD 15 million in the quarter to purchase raw materials to support continued operations.
Our Latin American team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment, while at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to be in a position to better weather the storm.
Slide 13 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume and unabsorbed overhead are unchanged from our July call. The first update is an increase in our outlook for price/mix net of raw materials. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $370 million, which reflects an increase related to our third quarter performance. We continue to expect raw materials to be down about 7% versus 2014 before cost savings actions. This includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.
With rapidly increasing inflation in Venezuela in the second half of the year, we revised our net cost savings in 2015 to be neutral. Outside of Venezuela, our businesses are delivering on our operational excellence initiatives. The savings, excluding Venezuela, are on plan and are delivering as expected. Our segment operating income drivers include about $20 million of earnings in Venezuela in the fourth quarter as we have sufficient U.S. dollars to enable us to produce through the end of the year.
We are taking a cautious view on Q4 as Venezuela heads into its December election, which could amplify the already volatile environment. Based on current spot rates, we now expect translation to be a headwind of $160 million for the full year.
Finally, with our year-to-date strength in our other tire-related businesses, we've included a $20 million benefit in our outlook. In summary, as we look ahead and based on our current assumptions, we are tracking above our 10% to 15% segment operating income target for 2015 to $2 billion.
Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on Slide 14 and reflect updates related to our year-to-date trends. The significant changes are a reduction in our CapEx outlook to $1 billion to $1.1 billion and the likely need for $50 million to $75 million of working capital to support the business.
Turning to 2016, we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth. We have strong positive momentum in many parts of our business and challenges in others. We will weigh all these factors, including raw materials and foreign exchange, and provide our specific thoughts during our year-end earnings call.
Finally, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. Including the $30 million for repurchases during the third quarter, which essentially offset dilution, we've repurchased $313 million under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We also recently announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share, effective with our December dividend payment.

We've always said that any increases to that shareholder return program, you remember our capital allocation plan has a range on it right now. It's $0.6 billion to $1.25 billion. And again, we feel good about our results and where we're at. But as we generate that cash in the fourth quarter, we'll look to take another look at where we're at in our authorization.

It's typically high-end tires and it's very good mix, so forth. So it's very important to us. And as you know, we're a leader in winter technology. The situation that we're seeing, as you know, coming off of 3 warm winters in a row, and as Laura mentioned and I think as we said in the past, we've kind of planned for that sort of green winter even though we've seen some snow at this point. And part of what goes into our thinking is pretty much in line is what you're saying. You can almost call it the sort of the animal spirits of the winter or the channel in Europe right now, particularly in Germany. They do have higher inventory in the channel right now. And on top of that, you've had these 3 warm winters, so there's little motivation to go stock up and go long on tires. The industry is typically around 100 million units, something like that, if you do the math. We would say that with higher inventory in the channel, that's obviously still a question as to whether it can even reach that level. It's clearly been much higher than that if you go back to the white winters of 2011. It was actually much higher than what I'm saying. So as we look at it, we are going to continue to sort of stay in a cautious view. We think we're very well prepared for it. I went through on my remarks, our winter lineup, our Ultra Grip Performance tire, our Dunlop Winter Sport 5, our Vector 4Season for those that want to move to all season, that's a small market. But we have top-tier winning podium products in all of those categories right now, so we're ready. I think what would give us a boost, what would give the industry a boost, frankly, is cold weather and snow as we head into November here."

And I think that's important. That's what we saw coming. It's why we did what we did. And I would tell you, we took a long time in getting there, building up what you've heard me say, our brand and building up search on our brand. We're the #1 searched tire brand, tire manufacturer in the U.S., rivaling some other big online tire sellers right now and doing that as a manufacturer. We are significantly ahead of our -- of others, let's just say. And we did that very consciously to create the demand in the marketplace. Then we pulled together signing up our partner dealers and also putting the distribution capabilities in place and then marrying the technology to be able to make that work so a customer has a good experience as we're doing this really to make the tire buying process easier for the consumer. What I said, I said very simply, but it's a very complex problem. And it's one of those things that sort of bolt-ons don't necessarily make the process that less -- have that much less friction and it's because you got to hook up all kinds of things in the back. So this is not an easy thing to do to get the SKU explosion, to get the right tire to the right place at the right time when a consumer is going online to buy that tire. So this is not an easy process, and it's why we're being very methodical and having a good success as we go at this point. Having said that, I do think, like most other products and particularly around millennials being the consumers with $1 trillion of buying power with some 80 million millennials out there, that this will be an absolute way to buy tires, an expected way to buy tires because that's how that group does commerce to a large degree. So having a formula that works out there and being able to marry it with the brand and importantly, the distribution, both retailers and aligned distributors to get the tires there, is going to be what wins and that's how we're thinking about it, sort of building it from the bottom up to be able to deliver on that value promise. And so far, we feel very good about it. But there's no question, it will be a way that consumers want to shop, and Goodyear and its partners, partner dealers are getting ready for that."

So the first question on the way to catch up on supply, I would tell you, this is a point that we've been making relative to supplying those high-end HVA complex tires. Think the larger rim diameter, SUV tires, in particular, were performance tires. And those are tires that remain high in demand. The capacity for those tires, on a broad basis, still, I would say, is behind the demand for those tires. And that's something we are working to continue to make more of and doing that by getting more tires out of our existing factories, investing in our North American factories and also using our sort of lower demands around the world to import some of those tires in. So in the near term, that's how we're trying to catch up and continue to be a better supplier. Over the long term, that's also why we embarked on the Americas plant that we've talked on in the past. So that's something that will take some time to put in place. It also is going to be a function of the demand that's out there as well. We think that the demand will be there, and we're going to work -- we are working feverishly to do that, keeping our factories running full to be able to supply those tires. I would also say though, just to put it in perspective, that part of that market continues to grow. The other parts of the market, as we said, are always subject to these imports coming in. Remember, we had these big gyrations because buying ahead of tariffs and the like. And you have to remember, as that drives the market or has an impact on the market, it has -- it impacts us less as we're focused on other segments of the market and not so much what's happening in the lower end. The question on the sustainability of North America's market -- excuse me, margins, I would say, as we look at the business today, we remain -- the industry today, we remain very optimistic and positive on what's still available for us to go achieve. I just mentioned the demand for HVA tires out there. I made a few remarks earlier about the opportunities related to growing through digital. And as we look at our business, the tire business is really one of execution. Right tire, right place, right time, creating the right demand and having a brand that brings consumers to the stores and to our participating dealers. By doing those things right, and as I said, working and executing at the intersection of innovation of demand creation and of supply, we see continued opportunity to continue to grow our business. So we as we look at the earnings power of North America and we look at the industry conditions out there, I still remain very confident in the ability -- in the earnings ability of our North America business."

I would say that we are seeing probably demand higher than our expectations for the really highly complex tires, the performance and the SUV tires as well, and that continues to really put pressure on supply as we go."
