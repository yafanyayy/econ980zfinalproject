Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we had a strong finish to 2014, which puts us in a solid footing as we enter 2015. Our robust finish for the year underscores a couple of key points. First, it affirms our ability to manage, do various business and market cycles including the current lower commodity cycle that began in the fourth quarter. Thanks to a diversified portfolio, healthy balance sheet and sound business model. Importantly, the success we had last year in executing our expansion plan, securing contracts and safeguarding our credit metrics and financial flexibility provides us with a strong platform to build on, and you'll hear more about that when we review our new 3-year plan with you tomorrow. So I'll speak more to the full year shortly, but let's start with our fourth quarter results, which are shown on Slide 3. 
Spectra Energy generated ongoing EBITDA of $180 million compared with $798 million in the prior year's quarter. On a stand-alone basis, SEP delivered ongoing EBITDA of $424 million, $72 million higher than in the same period last year. The key drivers for the positive change in Spectra Energy's EBITDA quarter-over-quarter are: increased earnings of $75 million at Spectra Energy Partners compared with last year, mainly driven by expansion projects that generated about $30 million, primarily on our Texas Eastern system. Projects like TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which were put into service during the fourth quarter, are helping transform Texas Eastern into a bidirectional system and underpinned by firm long-term fee-based contracts. Increased earnings at SEP also reflect higher equity earnings due to the continued ramp-up of volumes on the Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines and higher crude transportation revenues resulting mainly from higher average tariff rates on the Express pipeline. Our Distribution segment reported EBITDA that was $24 million lower than the same period last year due mainly to the effective weaker Canadian dollar and lower customer usage as a result of weather that was 6% warmer compared to the prior-year quarter. 
Moving to our Western Canada business. We reported a $35 million increase in EBITDA over the prior-year quarter. Segment results were higher due to improved earnings from the Empress processing facility due largely to noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the risk management program we implemented early in 2014 partially offset by lower NGL sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. Gathering and processing revenues were higher as well but were partially offset by the effect of the weaker Canadian dollar. 
Let me take a moment to talk about Empress, which recorded $143 million of EBITDA for the full year, significantly exceeding both our 2013 results and our 2014 expectation of $80 million. This outperformance was a result of noncash gains related to our risk management program. On a cash basis, we recognized $83 million as there was a decoupling of cash in EBITDA attributable to the drop in NGL prices in the fourth quarter. 
So let me leave you with 3 key takeaways on Empress. First, the strong noncash mark-to-market gain for the quarter is a good indication of how hedged we are going into 2015. Second, there were likely be some accounting noise in 2015 as the hedges roll off and commodity prices move that cash will be realized as the contract settle. Third, and the bottom line is, we continue to expect Empress to contribute between $30 million and $50 million of cash on a go-forward basis and cash, of course, is what we're focused on. 
Moving on, let's turn now to Field Services. Our 50% share of equity earnings was a loss of $18 million for the quarter, $90 million less than last year's quarter. As noted in footnote #2 on Slide 3, while Field Services results show up in our EBITDA, the number actually represents our share of DCP Midstream's earnings before taxes or EBT. Just as a note, DCP's EBITDA on a stand-alone basis was $246 million for the quarter. The decrease at Field Services was primarily attributable to lower NGL and crude oil prices and the increase in noncontrolling interest as a result of continued asset dropdowns from ECM. The decrease was partially offset by incremental earnings associated with expansions. During the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively, DCP's realized NGL prices average $0.68 per gallon versus $0.99; NYMEX natural gas average $4 per MMBtu versus $3.60; and crude oil averaged approximately $73 per barrel versus $97. While DCP saw a decline in commodity prices in the quarter, it's worth noting that the full year average price for NGLs was $0.89, only $0.05 less than our original pricing assumption for 2014, and crude oil averaged $93 a barrel compared with the $95 we originally assumed. At the these price levels, DCP stand-alone EBITDA was almost $1.2 billion for the year. I'll also note that during the fourth quarter, we completed the second STEP in our 3-part drop-down of the Southeast supply header system moving from Spectra Energy other to the U.S. Transmission line. 
Let's now turn to distributable cash flow and cash contributions for the quarter as shown on Slide 4. Spectra Energy's DCF for the quarter was $316 million compared with $315 million in last year's quarter. DCF for the year was $1.46 billion, up $168 million from 2013 with strong dividend coverage of 1.6x well above our 2014 target of 1.4x. You'll note we've included Empress noncash items on this slide, and you'll see that going forward. 
Turning to Slide 5. Distributable cash flow at SEP was $245 million for the quarter. As a reminder, when we drop the remaining U.S. assets into SEP in November of 2013, we recast earnings but not distributable cash flow. You'll note that interest expense at SEP was down $29 million in the quarter, which was due mainly to the restructuring of an intercompany loan contributed to Spectra Energy Partners as part of the drop-down along with lower average debt balances. SEP ended the year with DCF of almost $1.1 billion and strong distribution coverage of 1.2x, which was also above our original expectation of 1.1x. 
Moving to Slide 6. Spectra Energy received general partner and limited partner distributions from SEP for the quarter of $47 million and $137 million, respectively. For the full year, we received GP distributions and LP distributions of more than $700 million from SEP. For the quarter, DPM paid general partner and limited partner distributions, the DCP Midstream, of $15 million and $9 million, respectively. For the full year, DCP received GP distributions of $52 million and LP distributions of $35 million from DPM. You'll recall that in the third quarter, we began providing DCP's distributable cash flow in our quarterly earnings materials as we have changed the distribution policy from 90% of DCP's net income to maintaining distribution coverage of 1.1x cash flow. At a 50% level, DCP standalone distributable cash flow was slightly negative for the quarter mainly as a result of lower NGL in crude prices. For the year, Spectra Energy received $237 million of cash distribution from DCP. But here's an important point. There's a stop-loss effect on Spectra Energy's DCF related to DCP because distributions from the partnership can't drop below 0. And while it may seem counterintuitive, lower DCP earnings result in lower cash taxes at Spectra Energy so there's actually a positive offset in our DCF. 
All in all, we had a strong fourth quarter and an exceptional year. Our success story continues to revolve around solid performances by our fee-based businesses and our expansion efforts especially at SEP and the resulting growth in earnings and cash flows. We are positioned extremely well to continue to deliver value to our shareholders going forward. Greg's going to highlight our key successes for the year; but from financial perspective, I'll note that we have excellent cash coverage for our dividend. Spectra Energy, we ended 2014 with coverage of 1.6x exceeding our original estimate of 1.4x. This additional margin coverage supports the $0.14 per share increase in our annual dividend that we announced late last year even in the lower commodity environment we're currently experiencing. Positive credit metrics and investment-grade balance sheet at both Spectra Energy and SEP. Spectra Energy ended the year with the debt-to-cap ratio of 58%, identical to a year ago, and we exceeded expectations with respect to our 2014 debt-to-EBITDA ratios with Spectra Energy ending the year at 4.7x and SEP at 3.7x. 
Lastly, we have multiple ways to finance our drive to $35 billion with SEP as the primary vehicle to fund the majority of growth CapEx that is currently in execution. One of those options the ATM program that we've had underway at SEP since last year and which we used to raise about $330 million of equity. We clearly are very pleased with what we accomplished in 2014. I look forward to talking with you tomorrow about our outlook for the next 3 years. So with that, let me turn things over to Greg."

As you heard from Pat, Spectra Energy delivered impressive results in 2014 which really provides us a great platform to get into 2015. We're very pleased with our performance for the year and our record of executing on growth opportunities that drive our earnings and cash flows now and well into the future. Our track record shows that we deliver on our promises throughout all market cycles. And in 2014, we even surpassed our own expectations. We beat our 2014 DCF expectations by nearly 19% at Spectra Energy and 14% at SEP. We beat our dividend and distribution coverage targets for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners and ended the year with coverage ratios of 1.6x and 1.2x, respectively. We improved our annual dividend growth to $0.14 per share, up from our original plan and commitment to investors of $0.12 per share. And we continued to increase the quarterly distribution at SEP announcing our 29th consecutive quarter increase just this morning. And unitholders will be pleased with the fact that we increased quarterly distribution by $0.01 in a quarter per unit, up from the $0.01 increase they received in recent quarters. 
Our financial results really reflect our ability to reliably execute, operate and expand our projects and assets. We've placed almost $800 million of projects into service during 2014, projects like TEAM South and TEAM 2014 in U.S. Transmission, and our Liquids business expanded its Buffalo storage terminal to facilitate deliveries to a new refinery customer. Western Canada also placed the North Montney project into service, which expanded processing capacity in the region under long-term contracts to meet incremental customer needs. All of these projects exemplify our ability to optimize our existing footprint to provide an earnings growth and meet customer needs. We secured an additional $3.5 billion in new growth projects supported by firm, fee-based contracts, projects like -- to Parkway expansion, Stratton Ridge, Access South, -- South West, Atlantic Bridge and, of course, NEXUS. We receive record throughout our system -- Texas Eastern, Algonquin, East Tennessee, that, Union Gas, Western Canada and maritime systems, indicating our customers use and, most importantly, value capacity on the day they need it most. And perhaps most importantly, as a company, we realized our all-time best record for safety. Responsible development of new projects, safe reliable operations, strong consistent earnings growth and cash flows, premier asset positioning and connectivity that take us where the lights are an attractive reliable dividend and distribution increases for investors throughout all market cycles are the hallmark of Spectra Energy. 
Overall, we had a strong finish to 2014. And importantly, it provides us with a solid financial and operational platform as we move into 2015. I want to keep things very brief this morning as our strong results really speak for themselves. Of course, you'll hear plenty from myself and the team tomorrow as we'll speak at length about our 2015 to 2017 plan and our ability to manage through this lower commodity cycle while continuing to meet or exceed the commitments we already made to investors. But for now, let's take your questions on the strong Q4 and 2014 year-end results. Julie?"

But the very big projects, Darren, look, I would expect it commodity prices stay where they are kind of a final decision on those projects moves out by a month, if you will. But we've expected those projects to kind of get secured towards the latter half of the decade. I'd still expect that to be the case. Again, if you're going to assume commodity prices stay very low for long period of time, I guess you could question that. But remember that's not really what those pipes are doing. What those pipes are doing is taking advantage of the differential that exist in Western Canada, for example, and get it to higher priced markets. So Western Canada just for simplicity, at $50 and $55 you can get it in Wood River, Patoka or the Gulf. You're still going to find a way to capture that delta. So I don't think it ultimately change the size of those projects. I think what we're really discussing is when those projects moving to a final investment decision."

Christine, it takes 4 to 6 months for some of those activity impacts to start kicking in. So we'll talk about this a bit tomorrow. But again, you'll still have largely a fee-based nature of our GNP activities out there. So there's 2 elements. One, people want to use interruptible as opposed to committing to new projects that maybe others were proposing. And 2, we still have fee-based contracts out there for the vast majority of what we do on the GNP side of things being, more like pipe and contracts United States people still have to pay us.

Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we had a strong finish to 2014, which puts us on a solid footing as we enter 2015. Our robust finish for the year underscores a couple of key points. First, it affirms our ability to manage, do various business and market cycles including the current lower commodity cycle that began in the fourth quarter. Thanks to a diversified portfolio, healthy balance sheet and sound business model. Importantly, the success we had last year in executing on our expansion plans, securing contracts and safeguarding our credit metrics and financial flexibility, provides us with a strong platform to build on, and you'll hear more about that when we review our new 3-year plan with you tomorrow. So I'll speak more to the full year shortly, but let's start with our fourth quarter results, which are shown on Slide 3.
Spectra Energy generated ongoing EBITDA of $180 million compared with $798 million in the prior year's quarter. On a standalone basis, SEP delivered ongoing EBITDA of $424 million, $72 million higher than in the same period last year. The key drivers for the positive change in Spectra Energy's EBITDA quarter-over-quarter are: increased earnings of $75 million at Spectra Energy Partners compared with last year, mainly driven by expansion projects that generated about $30 million, primarily on our Texas Eastern system. Projects like TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which were put into service during the fourth quarter, are helping transform Texas Eastern into a bidirectional system and are underpinned by firm long-term fee-based contracts. Increased earnings at SEP also reflect higher equity earnings due to the continued ramp-up of volumes on the Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines and higher crude transportation revenues resulting mainly from higher average tariff rates on the Express pipeline. Our Distribution segment reported EBITDA, that was $24 million lower than the same period last year due mainly to the effect of weaker Canadian dollar and lower customer usage as a result of weather that was 6% warmer compared to the prior year quarter.
Moving to our Western Canada business. We reported a $35 million increase in EBITDA over the prior year quarter. Segment results were higher due to improved earnings from the Empress processing facility due largely to noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the risk management program, we implemented early in 2014, partially offset by lower NGL sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. Gathering and processing revenues were higher as well, but were partially offset by the effect of the weaker Canadian dollar.
Let me take a moment to talk about Empress, which recorded $143 million of EBITDA for the full year, significantly exceeding both our 2013 results and our 2014 expectation of $80 million. This outperformance was a result of noncash gains related to our risk management program. On a cash basis, we recognized $83 million as there was a decoupling of cash and EBITDA attributable to the drop in NGL prices in the fourth quarter.
So let me leave you with 3 key takeaways on Empress. First, the strong noncash mark-to-market gain for the quarter is a good indication of how hedged we are going into 2015. Second, there were likely be some accounting noise in 2015 as the hedges roll off and commodity prices move that cash will be realized as the contract settle. Third, and the bottom line is, we continue to expect Empress to contribute between $30 million and $50 million of cash on a go-forward basis and cash, of course, is what we're focused on.
Moving on, let's turn now to Field Services. Our 50% share of equity earnings was a loss of $18 million for the quarter, $90 million less than last year's quarter. As noted in footnote #2 on Slide 3, while Field Services results show up in our EBITDA, the number actually represents our share of DCP Midstream's earnings before taxes or EBT. Just as a note, DCP's EBITDA on a standalone basis was $246 million for the quarter. The decrease at Field Services was primarily attributable to lower NGL and crude oil prices and the increase in noncontrolling interest as a result of continued asset drop-downs at DPM. The decreases were partially offset by incremental earnings associated with expansions. During the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively, DCP's realized NGL prices averaged $0.68 per gallon versus $0.99; NYMEX natural gas averaged $4 per MMBtu versus $3.60; and crude oil averaged approximately $73 per barrel versus $97. While DCP saw a decline in commodity prices in the quarter, it's worth noting that the full year average price for NGLs was $0.89, only $0.05 less than our original pricing assumption for 2014, and crude oil averaged $93 a barrel compared with the $95 we originally assumed. At these price levels, DCP's standalone EBITDA was almost $1.2 billion for the year. I'll also note that during the fourth quarter, we completed the second STEP in our 3-part drop-down of the Southeast supply header system moving it from Spectra Energy other to the U.S. Transmission line.
Let's now turn to distributable cash flow and cash contributions for the quarter as shown on Slide 4. Spectra Energy's DCF for the quarter was $316 million compared with $315 million in last year's quarter. DCF for the year was $1.46 billion, up $168 million from 2013 with strong dividend coverage of 1.6x well above our 2014 target of 1.4x. You'll note we've included Empress noncash items on this slide, and you'll see that going forward.
Turning to Slide 5. Distributable cash flow at SEP was $245 million for the quarter. As a reminder, when we drop the remaining U.S. assets into SEP in November of 2013, we recast earnings but not distributable cash flow. You'll note that interest expense at SEP was down $29 million in the quarter, which was due mainly to the restructuring of an intercompany loan contributed to Spectra Energy Partners as part of the drop-down along with lower average debt balances. SEP ended the year with DCF of almost $1.1 billion and strong distribution coverage of 1.2x, which was also above our original expectation of 1.1x.
Moving to Slide 6. Spectra Energy received general partner and limited partner distributions from SEP for the quarter of $47 million and $137 million, respectively. For the full year, we received GP distributions and LP distributions of more than $700 million from SEP. For the quarter, DPM paid general partner and limited partner distributions, the DCP Midstream, of $15 million and $9 million, respectively. For the full year, DCP received GP distributions of $52 million and LP distributions of $35 million from DPM. You'll recall that in the third quarter, we began providing DCP's distributable cash flow in our quarterly earnings materials as we have changed the distribution policy from 90% of DCP's net income to maintaining distribution coverage of 1.1x cash flow. At a 50% level, DCP standalone distributable cash flow was slightly negative for the quarter, mainly as a result of lower NGL in crude prices. For the year, Spectra Energy received $237 million of cash distributions from DCP. But here's an important point. There's a stop-loss effect on Spectra Energy's DCF related to DCP because distributions from the partnership can't drop below 0. And while it may seem counterintuitive, lower DCP earnings result in lower cash taxes at Spectra Energy so there's actually a positive offset in our DCF.
All in all, we had a strong fourth quarter and an exceptional year. Our success story continues to revolve around solid performances by our fee-based businesses and our expansion efforts especially at SEP and the resulting growth in earnings and cash flows. We are positioned extremely well to continue to deliver value to our shareholders going forward.
Greg is going to highlight our key successes for the year, but from financial perspective, I'll note that we have excellent cash coverage for our dividend. For Spectra Energy, we ended 2014 with coverage of 1.6x exceeding our original estimate of 1.4x. This additional margin of coverage supports the $0.14 per share increase in our annual dividend that we announced late last year even in the lower commodity environment we're currently experiencing. Positive credit metrics and investment-grade balance sheet at both Spectra Energy and SEP. Spectra Energy ended the year with the debt-to-cap ratio of 58%, identical to a year ago, and we exceeded expectations with respect to our 2014 debt-to-EBITDA ratios with Spectra Energy ending the year at 4.7x and SEP at 3.7x.
Lastly, we have multiple ways to finance our drive to $35 billion with SEP as the primary vehicle to fund the majority of growth CapEx that is currently in execution. One of those options is the ATM program that we've had underway at SEP since last year, and which we used to raise about $330 million of equity. We clearly are very pleased with what we accomplished in 2014. I look forward to talking with you tomorrow about our outlook for the next 3 years.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg."

As you heard from Pat, Spectra Energy delivered impressive results in 2014 which really provides us a great platform to get into 2015. We're very pleased with our performance for the year and our record of executing on growth opportunities that drive our earnings and cash flows now and well into the future. Our track record shows that we deliver on our promises throughout all market cycles. And in 2014, we even surpassed our own expectations. We beat our 2014 DCF expectation by nearly 19% at Spectra Energy and 14% at SEP. We beat our dividend and distribution coverage targets for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners, and ended the year with coverage ratios of 1.6x and 1.2x, respectively. We improved our annual dividend growth to $0.14 per share, up from our original plan and commitment to investors of $0.12 per share. And we continued to increase the quarterly distribution at SEP announcing our 29th consecutive quarterly increase just this morning. And unitholders will be pleased with the fact that we increased quarterly distributions by $0.01 in a quarter per unit, up from the $0.01 increase they received in recent quarters.
Our financial results really reflect our ability to reliably execute, operate and expand our projects and assets. We've placed almost $800 million of projects into service during 2014, projects like TEAM South and TEAM 2014 in U.S. Transmission, and our Liquids business expanded its Buffalo storage terminal to facilitate deliveries to a new refinery customer. Western Canada also placed the North Montney project into service, which expanded processing capacity in the region under long-term contracts to meet incremental customer needs. All of these projects exemplify our ability to optimize our existing footprint to provide an earnings growth and meet customer needs. We secured an additional $3.5 billion in new growth projects supported by firm, fee-based contracts, projects like Dawn to Parkway expansions, Stratton Ridge, Access South, Adair South West, Atlantic Bridge and, of course, NEXUS. We received record send-outs throughout our system on Texas Eastern, Algonquin, East Tennessee, Platte, Union Gas, Western Canada and maritime systems, indicating our customers use and, most importantly, value capacity on the day they need it most. And perhaps, most importantly, as a company, we realized our all-time best record for safety. Responsible development of new projects, safe reliable operations, strong consistent earnings growth and cash flows, premier asset positioning and connectivity that takes us where the lights are and attractive reliable dividend and distribution increases for investors throughout all market cycles, both are the hallmarks of Spectra Energy.
Overall, we had a strong finish to 2014. And importantly, it provides us with a solid financial and operational platform as we move into 2015. I want to keep things very brief this morning as our strong results really speak for themselves. Of course, you'll hear plenty from myself and the team tomorrow as we'll speak at length about our 2015 to 2017 plan and our ability to manage through this lower commodity cycle while continuing to meet or exceed the commitments we've already made to investors. But for now, let's take your questions on the strong Q4 and 2014 year end results. Julie?"

But we had expected those projects to, kind of, get secured towards the latter half of the decade. I'd still expect that to be the case. Again, if you're going to assume commodity prices stay very low for a long period of time, I guess you could question that. But remember that's not really what those pipes are doing. What those pipes are doing is taking advantage of the differential that exist in Western Canada, for example, and getting those to higher priced markets. So, if Western Canada is at, just for simplicity, at $50 and $55 you can get it in Wood River, Patoka or the Gulf. You're still going to try to find a way to capture that delta. So I don't think it ultimately changes the size of those projects. And I think what we're really discussing is when those projects move into a final investment decision."

We hadn't through the fourth quarter seen any real run off from an activity perspective. I think, as you won't be surprised, Christine, it takes 4 to 6 months for some of those activity impacts to start kicking in. So we'll talk about this a bit tomorrow. But again, you still have largely a fee-based nature of our GNP activities out there. So there's 2 elements: One, people wanted to use interruptible as opposed to committing to new projects that maybe others were proposing; and two, we still have fee-based contracts out there for the vast majority of what we do on the GNP side of things being there, more like pipeline contracts here in the United States, the people still have to pay us.

Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we had a strong finish to 2014, which puts us on a solid footing as we enter 2015. Our robust finish for the year underscores a couple of key points. First, it affirms our ability to manage through various business and market cycles including the current lower commodity cycle that began in the fourth quarter. Thanks to a diversified portfolio, healthy balance sheet and sound business model. Importantly, the success we had last year in executing on our expansion plans, securing contracts and safeguarding our credit metrics and financial flexibility, provides us with a strong platform to build on, and you'll hear more about that when we review our new 3-year plan with you tomorrow. So I'll speak more to the full year shortly, but let's start with our fourth quarter results, which are shown on Slide 3.
Spectra Energy generated ongoing EBITDA of $180 million (sic) [$810 million] compared with $798 million in the prior year's quarter. On a standalone basis, SEP delivered ongoing EBITDA of $424 million, $72 million higher than in the same period last year. The key drivers for the positive change in Spectra Energy's EBITDA quarter-over-quarter are: increased earnings of $75 million at Spectra Energy Partners compared with last year, mainly driven by expansion projects that generated about $30 million, primarily on our Texas Eastern system. Projects like TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which were put into service during the fourth quarter, are helping transform Texas Eastern into a bidirectional system and are underpinned by firm long-term fee-based contracts. Increased earnings at SEP also reflect higher equity earnings due to the continued ramp-up of volumes on the Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines and higher crude transportation revenues resulting mainly from higher average tariff rates on the Express pipeline. Our Distribution segment reported EBITDA, that was $24 million lower than the same period last year due mainly to the effect of weaker Canadian dollar and lower customer usage as a result of weather that was 6% warmer compared to the prior year quarter.
Moving to our Western Canada business. We reported a $35 million increase in EBITDA over the prior year quarter. Segment results were higher due to improved earnings from the Empress processing facility due largely to noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the risk management program, we implemented early in 2014, partially offset by lower NGL sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. Gathering and processing revenues were higher as well, but were partially offset by the effect of the weaker Canadian dollar.
Let me take a moment to talk about Empress, which recorded $143 million in EBITDA for the full year, significantly exceeding both our 2013 results and our 2014 expectation of $80 million. This outperformance was the result of noncash gains related to our risk management program. On a cash basis, we recognized $83 million as there was a decoupling of cash and EBITDA attributable to the drop in NGL prices in the fourth quarter.
So let me leave you with 3 key takeaways on Empress. First, the strong noncash mark-to-market gain for the quarter is a good indication of how hedged we are going into 2015. Second, there will likely be some accounting noise in 2015 as the hedges roll off and commodity prices move, that cash will be realized as the contracts settle. Third, and the bottom line is, we continue to expect Empress to contribute between $30 million and $50 million of cash on a go-forward basis and cash, of course, is what we're focused on.
Moving on, let's turn now to Field Services. Our 50% share of equity earnings was a loss of $18 million for the quarter, $90 million less than last year's quarter. As noted in footnote #2 on Slide 3, while Field Services results show up in our EBITDA, the number actually represents our share of DCP Midstream's earnings before taxes or EBT. Just as a note, DCP's EBITDA on a standalone basis was $246 million for the quarter. The decrease at Field Services was primarily attributable to lower NGL and crude oil prices and the increase in noncontrolling interest as a result of continued asset drop-downs at DPM. The decreases were partially offset by incremental earnings associated with expansions. During the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively, DCP's realized NGL prices averaged $0.68 per gallon versus $0.99; NYMEX natural gas averaged $4 per MMBtu versus $3.60; and crude oil averaged approximately $73 per barrel versus $97. While DCP saw a decline in commodity prices in the quarter, it's worth noting that the full year average price for NGLs was $0.89, only $0.05 less than our original pricing assumption for 2014, and crude oil averaged $93 a barrel compared with the $95 we originally assumed. At these price levels, DCP's standalone EBITDA was almost $1.2 billion for the year. I'll also note that during the fourth quarter, we completed the second step in our 3-part drop-down of the Southeast supply header system moving it from Spectra Energy Other to the U.S. Transmission line.
Let's now turn to distributable cash flow and cash contributions for the quarter as shown on Slide 4. Spectra Energy's DCF for the quarter was $316 million compared with $315 million in last year's quarter. DCF for the year was $1.46 billion, up $168 million from 2013 with strong dividend coverage of 1.6x well above our 2014 target of 1.4x. You'll note we've included Empress noncash items on this slide, and you'll see that going forward.
Turning to Slide 5. Distributable cash flow at SEP was $245 million for the quarter. As a reminder, when we dropped the remaining U.S. assets into SEP in November of 2013, we recast earnings but not distributable cash flow. You'll note that interest expense at SEP was down $29 million in the quarter, which was due mainly to the restructuring of an intercompany loan contributed to Spectra Energy Partners as part of the drop-down along with lower average debt balances. SEP ended the year with DCF of almost $1.1 billion and strong distribution coverage of 1.2x, which was also above our original expectation of 1.1x.
Moving to Slide 6. Spectra Energy received general partner and limited partner distributions from SEP for the quarter of $47 million and $137 million, respectively. For the full year, we received GP distributions and LP distributions of more than $700 million from SEP. For the quarter, DPM paid general partner and limited partner distributions, the DCP Midstream, of $15 million and $9 million, respectively. For the full year, DCP received GP distributions of $52 million and LP distributions of $35 million from DPM. You'll recall that in the third quarter, we began providing DCP's distributable cash flow in our quarterly earnings materials as we had changed the distribution policy from 90% of DCP's net income to maintaining distribution coverage of 1.1x cash flow. At a 50% level, DCP standalone distributable cash flow was slightly negative for the quarter, mainly as a result of lower NGL and crude prices. For the year, Spectra Energy received $237 million of cash distributions from DCP. But here's an important point. There's a stop-loss effect on Spectra Energy's DCF related to DCP because distributions from the partnership can't drop below 0. And while it may seem counterintuitive, lower DCP earnings result in lower cash taxes at Spectra Energy so there's actually a positive offset in our DCF.
All in all, we had a strong fourth quarter and an exceptional year. Our success story continues to revolve around solid performances by our fee-based businesses and our expansion efforts especially at SEP and the resulting growth in earnings and cash flows. We are positioned extremely well to continue to deliver value to our shareholders going forward.
Greg is going to highlight our key successes for the year, but from financial perspective, I'll note that we have excellent cash coverage for our dividend. For Spectra Energy, we ended 2014 with coverage of 1.6x exceeding our original estimate of 1.4x. This additional margin of coverage supports the $0.14 per share increase in our annual dividend that we announced late last year even in the lower commodity environment we're currently experiencing. 
Positive credit metrics and investment-grade balance sheets at both Spectra Energy and SEP. Spectra Energy ended the year with a debt-to-cap ratio of 58%, identical to a year ago, and we exceeded expectations with respect to our 2014 debt-to-EBITDA ratios with Spectra Energy ending the year at 4.7x and SEP at 3.7x.
Lastly, we have multiple ways to finance our drive to $35 billion with SEP as the primary vehicle to fund the majority of growth CapEx that is currently in execution. One of those options is the ATM program that we've had underway at SEP since last year, and which we used to raise about $330 million of equity. We clearly are very pleased with what we accomplished in 2014. I look forward to talking with you tomorrow about our outlook for the next 3 years.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg."

We're very pleased with our performance for the",541,"Well, thanks very much, Pat, and good morning to everybody on the line. As you heard from Pat, Spectra Energy delivered impressive results in 2014 which really provides us a great platform to get into 2015. We're very pleased with our performance for the year and our record of executing on growth opportunities that drive our earnings and cash flows now and well into the future. Our track record shows that we deliver on our promises throughout all market cycles. And in 2014, we even surpassed our own expectations. We beat our 2014 DCF expectation by nearly 19% at Spectra Energy and 14% at SEP. We beat our dividend and distribution coverage targets for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners, and ended the year with coverage ratios of 1.6x and 1.2x, respectively. We improved our annual dividend growth to $0.14 per share, up from our original plan and commitment to investors of $0.12 per share. And we continued to increase the quarterly distribution at SEP announcing our 29th consecutive quarterly increase just this morning. And unitholders will be pleased with the fact that we increased quarterly distributions by $0.0125 per unit, up from the $0.01 increase they've received in recent quarters.
Our financial results really reflect our ability to reliably execute, operate and expand our projects and assets. We've placed almost $800 million of projects into service during 2014, projects like TEAM South and TEAM 2014 in U.S. Transmission, and our Liquids business expanded its Buffalo storage terminal to facilitate deliveries to a new refinery customer. Western Canada also placed the North Montney project into service, which expanded processing capacity in the region under long-term contracts to meet incremental customer needs. All of these projects exemplify our ability to optimize our existing footprint to provide an earnings growth and meet customer needs. We secured an additional $3.5 billion in new growth projects supported by firm, fee-based contracts, projects like our Dawn to Parkway expansions, Stratton Ridge, Access South, Adair Southwest, Atlantic Bridge and, of course, NEXUS. We received record sendouts throughout our system on Texas Eastern, Algonquin, East Tennessee, Platte, Union Gas, Western Canada and Maritimes systems, indicating that our customers use and, most importantly, value capacity on the day they need it most. And perhaps, most importantly, as a company, we realized our all-time best record for safety. Responsible development of new projects, safe reliable operations, strong consistent earnings growth and cash flows, premier asset positioning and connectivity that takes us where the lights are and attractive reliable dividend and distribution increases for investors throughout all market cycles, those are the hallmarks of Spectra Energy.
Overall, we had a strong finish to 2014. And importantly, it provides us with a solid financial and operational platform as we move into 2015. I'm going to keep things very brief this morning as our strong results really speak for themselves. Of course, you'll hear plenty from myself and the team tomorrow as we'll speak at length about our 2015 to 2017 plan and our ability to manage through this lower commodity cycle while continuing to meet or exceed the commitments we've already made to investors. But for now, let's take your questions on the strong Q4 and 2014 year end results. Julie?"

But we had expected those projects to, kind of, get secured towards the latter half of the decade. I'd still expect that to be the case. Again, if you're going to assume commodity prices stay very low for a long period of time, I guess you could question that. But remember that's not really what those pipes are doing. What those pipes are doing is taking advantage of the differential that exists in Western Canada, for example, and getting those to higher priced markets. So, if Western Canada is at, just for simplicity, at $50 and $55 you can get it in Wood River or Patoka or the Gulf. You're still going to try to find a way to capture that delta. So I don't think it ultimately changes the size of those projects. And I think what we're really discussing is when those projects move into a final investment decision."

We hadn't through the fourth quarter seen any real run-off from an activity perspective. I think, as you won't be surprised, Christine, it takes 4 to 6 months for some of those activity impacts to start kicking in. So we'll talk about this a bit tomorrow. But again, you still have largely a fee-based nature of our G&P activities up there. So there's 2 elements: One, people wanted to use interruptible as opposed to committing to new projects that maybe others were proposing; and two, we'd still have fee-based contracts up there for the vast majority of what we do on the G&P side of things being they're more like pipeline contracts here in the United States, so people still have to pay us. So the activity impacts our much more spread out from Spectra Energy perspective than what you might see on the E&P side or versus what you might see down here in the United States.

So as opposed to working with maybe some smaller players or committing to new plants, you'll use interruptible services at places like Spectra Energy to the extent we have capacity available in those areas."

Before Pat speaks for the numbers for the quarter, I thought I'd take a little bit of an opportunity to give you my perspectives on the results and give you a quick update on our structuring efforts at DCP Midstream. So let's start there. As you recall in February, we discussed that we were working with Phillips 66 to overcome the short-term challenges at DCP caused by the rapid drop in commodity prices. And we're also working to ensure that over the long-term, DCP and DPM were setup in a manner that provides the best opportunity for us to realize their full value. While there is still work to be completed, I'm pleased to report that we made good progress on both fronts during this quarter. To address short-term needs, DCP midstream worked with it's bank group to amend its bank revolver and DCP has also taken action to reduce corporate cost and its capital budget. And of course, we continue to work on a longer-term structural solution. 
As we drive to the right solution, let me reiterate our structuring objectives. First, we are working to ensure that the entire DCP complex is structured to achieve balance of fee-based and commodity contracts. Second, we expect to establish a foundation of sustainable cash flows in distributions for our public unitholders, while retaining the upside that will occur when commodity prices ultimately recover for the sponsors, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And third, we will ensure that any ultimate structuring still allows the DCP complex to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing, and it positions DCP to efficiently finance that growth. So work continues on this front and we expect to have a solution to share with you in the coming months. 
Moving to our first quarter at Spectra Energy, we delivered a strong start for the year. We exceeded our plan expectations for the quarter, even overcoming a lower-than-anticipated commodity environment and a weaker Canadian dollar. I think was a good example of the and sustainability of our overall earnings and cash generation. Our base businesses continue to perform very well, and we achieved a record delivery this past winter on our major pipeline systems, Texas Eastern, Algonquin, Union Dawn-Parkway system and T-South in Western Canada. That kind of utilization bodes well for future contract renewals and demonstrates the ongoing need for additional pipeline infrastructure that we will build for our customers' growing demands. And with the strength of our U.S. transmission and liquids business, SEP continues to roll along delivering solid results on its own right, as it brings new expansion projects into service. As you know, SEP's fee-based earnings have virtually no volume or commodity exposure, a unique and attractive benefits for SEP unitholders and Spectra Energy shareholders in these times. Thanks to a colder than normal winter, Union Gas beat its own expectation for this quarter. The occurred despite the lower Canadian dollar. Western Canada continues to form well in both a tough gas drilling and currency environment. And DCP's earnings were in line with it's first quarter plans as it did a good job overcoming lower-than-anticipated commodity prices. The DCP management team has done an excellent job of proactively managing through the current environment by reducing costs and enhancing operating efficiencies to ensure they meet their expectations. Very importantly, we are also ahead of expectations from a cash generation perspective. This again underlines the strength of Spectra Energy's portfolio businesses and our ability to consistently generate strong cash flows in various market cycles. It also reinforces confidence and our ability to deliver annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share, while maintaining coverage at or above 1x. So I'll be back shortly to talk about the excellent progress we are making on our drive to 35. But for now, I'll turn things over to Pat to talk about the detailed financial results for the first quarter compared to last year. Pat?"
610501,290663859,804946,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's EBIT",1192,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the significant drop in commodity prices combined with a weaker Canadian dollar. And, while we experienced another cold winter, weather was generally comparable across both periods. SEP's ongoing EBITDA was up almost 8% over last year's first quarter, reflecting increased earnings from expansion projects and helped by virtually no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations. So I'll draw your attention to the bottom of the Slide 4, as we take a look at the drivers for our EBITDA results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, which is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and liquids businesses. U.S. Transmission's ongoing EBITDA of $398 million was $24 million higher than in the first quarter of 2014. This quarter's results primarily reflect increased earnings from 2 expansion projects we placed in the service last year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South as well as the Kingsport project that commenced service earlier this year.  2015 results excluded a $9 million special item related to an impairment of our gas gathering assets. Our liquids business reported first quarter EBITDA of $64 million compared with $58 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings from the natural gas liquids pipeline reflecting increased volumes year-over-year. The express and flat group pipelines also continue to deliver strong results in the quarter, which were in line with our expectations. 
Distribution reported first quarter EBITDA of $192 million compared with $226 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due mainly to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was 13% this quarter. Also first quarter 2014 results included regulatory decisions from the Ontario Energy Board that in aggregate provided a $10 million benefit to the segments' 2014 results. Without those items, distribution's of EBITDA was in line with last year, so that this business continues to be strong. 
Western Canada transmission and processing reported EBITDA for the quarter of $161 million compared with $237 million in 2014. As expected, earnings were lower at Empress reflecting weaker commodity prices, primarily for propane, which was about 70% below 2014's price levels. Furthermore, we recorded a noncash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustment of negative $22 million. But as we discussed last quarter, with the implementation of risk management program at Empress, we are focused on stabilizing cash flows. We said, we expect Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash for the year and we are on track to achieve that result. Western Canada's earnings were also lower due to the weaker Canadian dollar. But as a reminder, while this change in the currency brought with it a headwind that reduced EBITDA by a combined $43 million in our 2 Canadian business segments, we are partially hedged on a net income basis. The FX effect on net income was $20 million in the first quarter of this year for our Canadian businesses. 
Moving to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing earnings was a negative $14 million in the quarter, which was $144 million less than 2014. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices and a decrease in equity gains associated with the issuance of partnership units by the in midstream partners. This decreases were partially offset by earnings from expansions, improved operating efficiencies and cost savings from various initiatives. While we would certainly prefer a stronger commodity environment, DCP has done a great job of controlling what they can and meeting the business budget goals in an environment where commodity prices are down 50% from last year's levels. DCP's 2015 ongoing results exclude a special item of $3 million for our share cost related organizational changes that were recognized during the quarter, it will be incurred through the remainder of this year. So on total, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter as expected. Importantly, however, despite both commodity prices and currency being weaker than we had forecast, these results exceeded our expectations for the 2015 quarter. The same holds true for our distributable cash flow, so let's take a look at our DCS scheduled beginning with SEP. SEP's standalone disputable cash flow for the quarter was $354 million, $30 million more than the same quarter last year, with the distribution coverage of 1.5x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to EBITDA generated by U.S. Transmission from expansion projects and higher volumes at sandhills pipeline in the liquids business. For the full year, we expect SEP's cover is to be 1.1x in line with our 2015 forecast. We remain confident in our ability to increase our quarterly distribution by a 0.10 quarter per unit, while maintaining our distinction coverage at or above 1x. SEP paid general partner and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter at $52 million and $142 million, respectively. 
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow. At SEC, distributable cash flow was $578 million for the quarter compared with $631 million in last year's quarter. Coverage was a very strong 2.3x and DCF per share was $0.86. Now just as a reminder, with some seasonality in our cash flows, our coverage will be lower in the second and third quarters. As we laid out in February, we continue to expect coverage to be 1.2x on a full year basis. 
While our EBITDA was down period-to-period, so our cash taxes. We received a higher tax refund in the first quarter of 2015 due to the approval of bonus depreciation laid in 2014. And our interest expense was lower compared to last year, mainly due to the weaker Canadian dollar as well as lower average long-term debt balances. As you would expect, given the level of growth we're pursuing and achieving, we've been busy on the financing front. We closed out our $400 million ATM continuous equity at SEP, and initiated new $500 million offering, which we expect to utilize throughout the year. Also in the first quarter, SEP successfully completed a $1 billion debt issuance at attractive rates, in our efforts to efficiently fund our growth investments. Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of March 31. So while we know it's early in the year, we are feeling very good about the how the business is continuing to perform. Despite commodity prices in the Canadian dollar being weaker than we had anticipated, when we put our budgets together, we are ahead of where we thought we would be at this times in terms of both EBITDA and distribute about cash flow, and these are both positive indicators of a strong year ahead. We are pleased with how we started the year and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year. So with that, let me turn things back to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our drive to 35."

As a just heard, Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy's partners first quarter results really will benefit from the new assets we put in the ground last year. And this ability to consistently deliver our projects into service as planned, allows us to take advantages to opportunities to grow, reaching new markets and enhance our pipeline systems. So let's take a look at how we're doing on that front. We have several projects scheduled to go into service this year. So let me begin with those. A U.S. Transmission, 2 projects OPEN and Uniontown to Gas City are under construction and scheduled to commence service in the fourth quarter. The OPEN project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to southern market and the Uniontown to Gas City project will deliver gas to the Midwest. Together, these 2 projects along with TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which you'll recall we brought into service last year, represent about 2/3 of the 2.4 Bcf a day in projects that will fully transform Texas Eastern to a bidirectional system by 2017. At our Liquids segment, we are constructing the Red Lake project to expand the reach of to access growing Permian Basin production. The project is scheduled to go into service during the second quarter. We're also on track with the construction of our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project, which is the first of several expansions. We're advancing along the Dawn-Parkway path at Union Gas. This project is scheduled to go into service during the fourth quarter of this year. 
In February, and DCP put it's keenly connector gathering line in the Gulf of Mexico into service. This project is part of the discovery joint venture, which is a jointly-owned operation between DCP Midstream Partners and Williams Partners. And DCP has a couple of other projects, including 2 and 2 plants, which are scheduled to be put into service later this year as well. 
All total by the year end -- by this year end, we have brought in -- or well have bought in an excess of $2 billion of projects into service, adding additional earnings and cash flow growth in 2016 and beyond. Other projects we have in execution are also proceeding very well. At SEP, we continue making progress on our NEXUS project and anticipate filing a formal FERC application later this year. We completed a subsequent open season for the project, adding upstream capacity on Texas Eastern for up to 950 million cubic feet per day and creating a direct path from Marcellus and Utica supply to reach NEXUS markets. 
During the quarter, the AIM Project in England received certificate and we'll begin construction shortly. The project is 100% subscribed by New England's major local distribution companies and is on track for in-service date in the second half of 2016. The Atlantic Bridge project continues to move forward and we will file its former FERC application later this year. The FERC approval process is the last step before building the project, which is a final scope of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day and a capital cost of about $650 million. This project scope will ensure we meet the needs of the LDC and industrial customers, who our service in 2017. Our Gulf Markets, East Tennessee and projects are all in track for their respected in-service dates. And you may have seen the Duke Energy announced is taking a 7.5% investment interest in stable trail, joining Spectra Energy and next areas project owners is expected. We continue to be on track to secure regulatory approvals on this project by early 2016 and meet our 2017 in the service date. On another front, just last week, we received regulatory approval from the Ontario Energy board for the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project. So that project remains nicely on track as well. And work continues on the 2 new projects in Western Canada to expand our BC pipeline. Jackfish Lake is a supply push project and the reliability and maintainability project or the RAM project is a demand pull project. Both of these pipeline expansions on track to be in service in 2017. Importantly during the quarter, we moved a new project Express enhancement into execution. This $135 million project is underpinned by long-term fee-based contract and will maximize the system throughput on our Express pipeline through the addition of on system terminal -- terminalling storage assets. The Express enhancement project is expected to go into service in 2016. So we have an impressive projects in execution. Projects that will deliver the earnings and cash flow, we have got in our 3-year plan. But we're looking well beyond the 3-year horizon of course, and we have a healthy backlog of projects and opportunities that lead to continued growth and value creation. And we're working diligently to move those projects forward. With more than $7.5 billion in services since 2013, more than $9 billion of expansion projects in execution. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our pledge of secure $35 billion of projects through the end of the decade. 
And let's take a look at some of our projects that are in development. I begin with our Access Northeast project at SEP. While AIM and Atlantic Bridge have been primarily contracted by LDCs, Access Northeast will mainly serve the electric power market. As many of you know, Access Northeast will improve electric reliability in New England by helping supply the vast majority of the regions most efficient gas powered generation. The project will expand our Algonquin, Maritimes and Northeast Systems and utilize their existing footprints. We're developing the project with Eversource and National Grid, who give us a strong competitive advantage and valued insight as together they serve $4.8 million of the $6.5 million electric customers in the region. The open season for Access Northeast ended on May 1 and we're moving to finalize and sign binding contracts with customers. Not surprisingly, we expected Eversource and National Grid will be key customers, and we'll contract for a significant portion of the projects' capacity. We anticipate moving Access Northeast into execution later this year. As mentioned earlier, our Northeast pipeline set new delivery records this past winter, a sure sign that additional infrastructure is needed. We believe that the regions policymakers understand that New England needs more low-cost gas to ensure reliability, winter time price stability and the regions competitiveness as evidenced by the recent New England governor's summit meeting on energy. 
In addition to the Access Northeast project, we've already conducted several open seasons this year to projects that would further connect Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Texas Eastern's proposed Lebanon extension project will provide shippers with the opportunity to obtain firm transportation service to deliver new natural gas suppliers to markets in Midwest U.S. We concluded our open season for the project in late March and we're targeting a project of about 100 million cubic feet per day and we expect this project to go into service during the second half of 2017. Our open season for the Marcellus to market expansion of Texas Eastern closed April 10 and results indicates strong interest from shippers for firm transportation that will deliver new incremental production to markets in the Northeast. The target in-service date for the Marcellus to market project is the second half of 2017. 
Our proposed Greater Philadelphia Expansion project extends our Texas Eastern system to provide shippers firm transportation to deliver points along or near the existing Philadelphia latter. The project's open season close this week, so we will be analyzing the market interest and could be targeting an expansion in the region as early as the second half of 2018. These 3 Appalachian expansion projects represent an incremental growth CapEx opportunity of $750 million to $1.5 billion, over and above what we already have in execution. At Union Gas, our 2017 Dawn-Parkway project recently completed its open season and received strong customer support. Commercial contracts are being finalized and we expect to file this project with OEB midyear, at which point we will also move in execution, and we can to do see demand growth in Ontario. we're exploring the possibility of further expansion of Dawn-Parkway system in 2018. Today, you'll see in Western Canada that we're announcing a binding open season on our T-North pipeline system in Northeast D.C. This is a supply push project and is driven by Spectra Energy's ability to add timely capacity at competitive rates to serve this important region in Western Canada. And finally, work continues on the West Coast connector project in Western Canada, which is well-positioned with it's approved corridor for 2 pipelines.
It's important to note that the West Coast connector is the only project with an improved multi-pipe corridor in British Columbia. Given the current global LNG pricing environment, we believe that this unique position provides attractive cost synergies for any future BC LNG investments. So we're off to a good start for the year and we know investors expect nothing less from us given our significant fee-based business model. Spectra Energy demonstrated its ability to succeed in the midst of various business cycles. We got a superior asset footprint that connects us not only to premium supply base, but also growing demand markets, a great portfolio of high-performing fee-based businesses and a powerful platform for ongoing expansion. As indicated, when we rolled out our plan of February, we have virtually no volume or commodity exposure at SEP and at Spectra Energy, our incremental commodity exposure as it affects our DCF is extremely limited as well. Both of these advantages are reflected in our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite lower-than-anticipated pricing. 
Our outlook for capital expansion continues to be very positive and we have already contracted to secured a significant portion of our drive to 35. Lastly and most importantly, our solid base businesses plus the growth we have already secured, support our commitment to grow our dividend by $0.14 per share annually with coverage at or above 1x. So thanks very much for joining us. And I'll turn things over to Julie, so we can take your questions."

And I think producers have just been very hesitant to do that. That being said, I think we continue -- you'll see us continue to push enhancement-type projects as well as the major products. I think the issue is not if, it's just when. So from a timing perspective, obviously if you do that has much different regulatory implications and if you just doing enhancements to basically get up to the existing capacity. But we're looking to work with other partners. We're looking to do enhancements and even Greenfield if necessary to meet the customer needs. But I think the type of projects you see like the enhancement where you had 25,000 or 30,000 barrels a day, is much more in line with what producers are willing to sign up today. So every month we see increase in the price of oil. I think the likelihood of those projects coming back fully on the radar screen and we believe that will definitely allow us to secure those big projects before the end of the decade."

We take great pride on the fact that we've been on those areas for half a century or so. But the Eversource and Grid folks have been there even longer and this is a ground game. And being able to understand the needs how to use existing assets to maximize capabilities and yet minimize new infrastructure is a real advantage to have those folks along. And then of course, we would expect them to help support the pipelines through contracts as well. And ultimately, there needs to be -- beyond on the FERC approves, there needs to be state approvals on some of this and they obviously have probably the best insight from that perspective.

Thanks for joining us. Before Pat speaks to the numbers for the quarter, I thought I'd take a little bit of an opportunity to give you my perspectives on the results and give you a quick update",680,"Well, thanks every much, Julie, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Before Pat speaks to the numbers for the quarter, I thought I'd take a little bit of an opportunity to give you my perspectives on the results and give you a quick update on our structuring efforts at DCP Midstream. So let's start there. As you recall in February, we discussed that we were working with Phillips 66 to overcome the short-term challenges at DCP caused by the rapid drop in commodity prices and that we're also working to ensure that over the long term, DCP and DPM were set up in a manner that provides the best opportunity for us to realize their full value. While there is still work to be completed, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress on both fronts during this quarter. To address its short-term needs, DCP Midstream worked with its bank group to amend its bank revolver, and DCP has also taken action to reduce corporate costs and its capital budget. And of course, we continue to work on a longer-term structural solution. 
As we drive to the right solution, let me reiterate our structuring objectives. First, we are working to ensure that the entire DCP complex is structured to achieve an optimal balance of fee-based and commodity-exposed contracts. Second, we expect to establish a foundation of sustainable cash flows and distributions for our public unitholders, while retaining the upside that will occur when commodity prices ultimately recover for the sponsors, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And third, we will ensure that any ultimate structuring still allows the DCP complex to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing and that it positions DCP to efficiently finance that growth. So work continues on this front, and we expect to have a solution to share with you in the coming months. 
Moving to our first quarter at Spectra Energy. We delivered a strong start to the year. We exceeded our plan expectations for the quarter, even overcoming a lower-than-anticipated commodity environment and a weaker Canadian dollar. The quarter, I think, was a good example of the stability and sustainability of our overall earnings and cash generation. Our base businesses continue to perform very well, and we achieved record deliveries this past winter on our major pipeline systems, Texas Eastern, Algonquin, Union's Dawn-Parkway system and T-South in Western Canada. That kind of utilization bodes well for future contract renewals and demonstrates the ongoing need for additional pipeline infrastructure that we will build for our customers' growing demands. And with the strength of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids business, SEP continues to roll along delivering solid results in its own right as it brings new expansion projects into service. As you know, SEP's fee-based earnings have virtually no volume or commodity exposure, a unique and attractive benefit for SEP unitholders and Spectra Energy shareholders in these times. 
Thanks to a colder-than-normal winter, Union Gas beat its own expectations for the quarter. The occurred despite the lower Canadian dollar. Western Canada continues to perform well in both a tough gas drilling and currency environment. And DCP's earnings were in line with its first quarter plans as it did a good job overcoming lower-than-anticipated commodity prices. The DCP management team has done an excellent job of proactively managing through the current environment by reducing costs and enhancing operating efficiencies to ensure they meet their expectations.
Very importantly, we are also ahead of expectations from a cash generation perspective. This again underlines the strength of Spectra Energy's portfolio of businesses and our ability to consistently generate strong cash flows in various market cycles. It also reinforces my own confidence in our ability to deliver annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share, while maintaining coverage at or above 1x.
So I'll be back shortly to talk about the excellent progress we're making on our Drive to 35. But for now, I'll turn things over to Pat to talk about the detailed financial results for the first quarter compared to last year. Pat?"
610501,290663859,805286,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's EBIT",1203,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the significant drop in commodity prices combined with a weaker Canadian dollar. And while we experienced another cold winter, weather was generally comparable across both periods. SEP's ongoing EBITDA was up almost 8% over last year's first quarter, reflecting increased earnings from expansion projects and helped by virtually no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations.
So I would draw your attention to the bottom of Slide 4 as we take a look at the drivers for our EBITDA results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, which is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses. U.S. Transmission's ongoing EBITDA of $398 million was $24 million higher than in the first quarter of 2014. This quarter's results primarily reflect increased earnings from 2 expansion projects we placed into service last year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South as well as the Kingsport project that commenced service earlier this year. 2015 results excluded a $9 million special item related to an impairment of Ozark Gas Gathering assets. Our Liquids business reported first quarter EBITDA of $64 million compared with $58 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings from the Sand Hills natural gas liquids pipeline, reflecting increased volumes year-over-year. The Express and Platte crude pipelines also continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, which were in line with our expectations. 
Distribution reported first quarter EBITDA of $192 million compared with $226 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due mainly to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was 13% weaker this quarter. Also, first quarter 2014 results included regulatory decisions from the Ontario Energy Board that in the aggregate provided a $10 million benefit to the segments' 2014 results. Without those items, distribution's EBITDA was in line with last year, so the base business continues to be strong. 
Western Canada transmission and processing reported EBITDA for the quarter of $161 million compared with $237 million in 2014. As expected, earnings were lower at Empress, reflecting weaker commodity prices, primarily for propane, which was about 70% below 2014's price levels. Furthermore, we recorded a noncash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustment of negative $22 million. But as we discussed last quarter, with the implementation of a risk management program at Empress, we are focused on stabilizing cash flows. We said we expect Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash for the year and we are on track to achieve that result. Western Canada's earnings were also lower due to the weaker Canadian dollar. But as a reminder, while this change in the currency brought with it a headwind that reduced EBITDA by a combined $43 million in our 2 Canadian business segments, we are partially hedged on a net income basis. The FX effect on net income was $20 million in the first quarter of this year for our Canadian businesses. 
Moving to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing earnings was a negative $14 million in the quarter, which was $144 million less than 2014. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices and a decrease in equity gains associated with the issuance of partnership units by DCP Midstream Partners. These decreases were partially offset by earnings from expansions, improved operating efficiencies and cost savings from various initiatives. While we would certainly prefer a stronger commodity environment, DCP has done a great job of controlling what they can and meeting the business budget goals in an environment where commodity prices are down 50% from last year's levels. DCP's 2015 ongoing results exclude a special item of $3 million for our share of cost related to organizational changes that were recognized during the quarter. Additional costs related to these changes will be incurred through the remainder of this year. So in total, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter as expected. Importantly, however, despite both commodity prices and currency being weaker than we had forecast, these results exceeded our expectations for the 2015 quarter.
The same holds true for our distributable cash flow, so let's take a look at our DCF schedules, beginning with SEP. SEP's standalone disputable cash flow for the quarter was $354 million, $30 million more than the same quarter last year with distribution coverage of 1.5x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to EBITDA generated by U.S. Transmission from expansion projects and higher volumes at Sand Hills pipeline in the Liquids business. For the full year, we expect SEP's coverage to be 1.1x in line with our 2015 forecast. We remain confident in our ability to increase our quarterly distributions by a 0.10 quarter per unit, while maintaining our distribution coverage at or above 1x. SEP paid general partner and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $52 million and $142 million, respectively. 
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow. At SE, distributable cash flow was $578 million for the quarter compared with $631 million in last year's quarter. Coverage was a very strong 2.3x, and DCF per share was $0.86. Now just as a reminder, with some seasonality in our cash flows, our coverage will be lower in the second and third quarters. But as we laid out in February, we continue to expect coverage to be 1.2x on a full year basis. 
While our EBITDA was down period-to-period, so were our cash taxes. We received a higher tax refund in the first quarter of 2015 due to the approval of bonus depreciation late in 2014. And our interest expense was lower compared to last year, mainly due to the weaker Canadian dollar as well as lower average long-term debt balances. As you would expect, given the level of growth we're pursuing and achieving. We've been busy on the financing front. We closed out our $400 million ATM continuous equity at SEP and initiated a new $500 million offering, which we expect to utilize throughout the year. Also in the first quarter, SEP successfully completed a $1 billion debt issuance at attractive rates in furtherance of our efforts to efficiently fund our growth investments. Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of March 31. So while we know it's early in the year, we're feeling very good about the how the businesses continue to perform. Despite commodity prices and the Canadian dollar being weaker than we had anticipated, when we put our budgets together, we are ahead of where we thought we would be at this time in terms of both EBITDA and distribute about cash flow. And these are both positive indicators of a strong year ahead. We are pleased with how we started the year and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year.
So with that, let me turn things back to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you've just heard, Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners' first quarter results really benefited from new assets we put in the ground last year. And this ability to consistently deliver our projects into service as planned allows us to take advantages to opportunities to grow, reach new markets and enhance our pipeline systems. So let's take a look at how we're doing on that front. We have several projects scheduled to go into service this year. So let me begin with those.
At U.S. Transmission, 2 projects, OPEN and Uniontown to Gas City, are under construction and scheduled to commence service in the fourth quarter. The OPEN project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to southern markets and the Uniontown to Gas City project will deliver gas to the Midwest. Together, these 2 projects, along with TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which you'll recall we brought into service last year, represent about 2/3 of the 2.4 Bcf a day in projects that will fully transform Texas Eastern to a bidirectional system by 2017. At our Liquids segment, we are constructing the Red Lake project to expand the reach of Sand Hills to access growing Permian Basin production. The project is scheduled to go into service during the second quarter. We're also on track with the construction of our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project, which is the first of several expansions we're advancing along the Dawn-Parkway path at Union Gas. This project is scheduled to go into service during the fourth quarter of this year. 
In February, DCP put its Keathley Canyon connector gathering line in the Gulf of Mexico into service. This project is part of the Discovery joint venture, which is a jointly owned operation between DCP Midstream Partners and Williams Partners. And DCP has a couple of other projects, including the Lucerne 2 and Zia II Plants, which are scheduled to be put into service later this year as well. 
All total by the year-end, we -- by this year-end, we have brought in -- or will have brought in an excess of $2 billion of projects into service, adding additional earnings and cash flow growth in 2016 and beyond. Other projects we have in execution are also proceeding very well. At SEP, we continue making progress on our NEXUS project and anticipate filing a formal FERC application later this year. We completed a subsequent open season for the project, adding upstream capacity on Texas Eastern for up to 950 million cubic feet per day and creating a direct path for Marcellus and Utica supply to reach NEXUS markets. 
During the quarter, the AIM Project in New England received its FERC certificate and will begin construction shortly. The project is 100% subscribed by New England's major local distribution companies and is on track for an in-service date in the second half of 2016. The Atlantic Bridge project continues to move forward, and we will file its formal FERC application later this year. The FERC approval process is the last step before building the project, which is a final scope of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day and a capital cost of about $650 million. This project's scope will ensure we meet the needs of the LDC and industrial customers who will require our service in 2017. Our Gulf Markets, East Tennessee, Loudon and Sabal Trail projects are all on track for their respective in-service dates. And you may have seen that Duke Energy announced it is taking a 7.5% investment interest in Sabal Trail, joining Spectra Energy and NextEra as project owners as expected. We continue to be on track to secure regulatory approvals on this project by early 2016 and meet our 2017 in the service date. On another front, just last week, we received regulatory approval from the Ontario Energy Board for the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project. So that project remains nicely on track as well. And work continues on the 2 new projects in Western Canada to expand our BC pipeline. Jackfish Lake is a supply push project, and the Reliability and Maintainability Project, or the RAM Project, is a demand pull project. Both of these pipeline expansions are on track to be in service in 2017. Importantly during the quarter, we moved a new project, Express Enhancement, into execution. This $135 million project is underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts and will maximize the system throughput on our Express pipeline through the addition of on-system terminal and -- terminalling and storage assets. The Express Enhancement project is expected to go into service in 2016. So we have an impressive slate of projects in execution, projects that will deliver the earnings and cash flow we had in our 3-year plan. But we're looking well beyond the 3-year horizon, of course, and we have a healthy backlog of projects and opportunities that lead to continued growth and value creation. And we're working diligently to move those projects forward. With more than $7.5 billion in service since 2013, more than $9 billion of expansion projects in execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our pledge to secure $35 billion of expansion projects through the end of the decade. 
Let's take a look at some of our projects that are in development. I'll begin with our Access Northeast project at SEP. While AIM and Atlantic Bridge have primarily been contracted by LDCs, Access Northeast will mainly serve the electric power market. As many of you know, Access Northeast will improve electric reliability in New England by helping supply the vast majority of the region's most efficient gas-powered generation. The project will expand our Algonquin and Maritimes & Northeast systems and utilize their existing footprints. We're developing the project with Eversource and National Grid, who give us a strong competitive advantage and valued insight as, together, they serve 4.8 million of the 6.5 million electric customers in the region. The open season for Access Northeast ended on May 1 and we're moving to finalize and sign binding contracts with customers. Not surprisingly, we expect that Eversource and National Grid will be key customers and will contract for a significant portion of the project's capacity. We anticipate moving Access Northeast into execution later this year.
As mentioned earlier, our Northeast pipeline set new delivery records this past winter, a sure sign that additional infrastructure is needed. We believe that the region's policymakers understand that New England needs more low-cost gas to ensure reliability, winter time price stability and the region's competitiveness as evidenced by the recent New England governor's summit meeting on energy. 
In addition to the Access Northeast project, we've already conducted several open seasons this year to projects that would further connect Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Texas Eastern's proposed Lebanon Extension project will provide shippers with the opportunity to obtain firm transportation service to deliver new natural gas supplies to markets in the Midwest U.S. We concluded our open season for the project in late March, and we're targeting a project of about 100 million cubic feet per day. And we expect this project to go into service during the second half of 2017. Our open season for the Marcellus to market expansion of Texas Eastern closed April 10 and results indicate strong interest from shippers for firm transportation that will deliver new incremental production to markets in the Northeast. The target in-service date for the Marcellus to market project is the second half of 2017. 
Our proposed Greater Philadelphia Expansion project extends our Texas Eastern system to provide shippers with firm transportation to delivery points along or near the existing Philadelphia Lateral. The project's open season closed this week, so we will be analyzing the market interest and could be targeting an expansion in the region as early as the second half of 2018. These 3 Appalachian expansion projects represent an incremental growth CapEx opportunity of $750 million to $1.5 billion, over and above what we already have in execution. At Union Gas, our 2017 Dawn-Parkway project recently completed its open season and received strong customer support. Commercial contracts are being finalized, and we expect to file this project with the OEB midyear, at which point we will also move it into execution. And we continue to see demand growth in Ontario, that we're exploring the possibility of further expansion of the Dawn-Parkway system in 2018.
Today, you'll see in Western Canada that we're announcing a binding open season on our T-North pipeline system in Northeast BC. This is a supply push project and is driven by Spectra Energy's ability to add timely capacity at competitive rates to serve this important region in Western Canada.
And finally, work continues on the Westcoast Connector project in Western Canada, which is well positioned with its approved corridor for 2 pipelines. It's important to note that the Westcoast Connector is the only project with an approved multi-pipe corridor in British Columbia. Given the current global LNG pricing environment, we believe that this unique position provides attractive cost synergies for any future BC LNG investments.
So we're off to a good start for the year and we know our investors expect nothing less from us, given our significant fee-based business model. Spectra Energy has demonstrated its ability to succeed in the midst of various business cycles. We've got a superior asset footprint that connects us not only to premium supply basins, but also to growing demand markets, a great portfolio of high-performing fee-based businesses and a powerful platform for ongoing expansion. As indicated, when we rolled out our plan in February, we have virtually no volume or commodity exposure at SEP. And at Spectra Energy, our incremental commodity exposure, as it affects our DCF, is extremely limited as well. Both of these advantages are reflected in our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite lower-than-anticipated pricing. 
Our outlook for capital expansion continues to be very positive, and we've already contractually secured a significant portion of our Drive to 35. Lastly and most importantly, our solid base businesses, plus the growth we've already secured, support our commitment to grow our dividend by $0.14 per share annually with coverage at or above 1x.

If you look at what you're doing with the Lebanon Expansion and the Marcellus to market expansion on Texas Eastern and then, of course, in Philadelphia, obviously, there's some variability in terms of CapEx spend. I'm just wondering, outside of the 100 million cubic foot a day that you detailed that the Lebanon Project could represent, what do you think the scale and scope of those expansions ultimately would be? And from a time-to-market perspective, just based on the competitive landscape and certainly the oversupply in the area, do you think that there's any opportunity for maybe those to get the greenlight added to backlog quicker and, from a net present value basis, be more of a benefit for future organic growth to come?"

So in terms of the scale and the scope of the projects that we have an origination now, there is a fair amount of variability. Philly is probably the biggest variable. We've identified a really good lift and relay project down the Philly Lateral. That's probably an area that's next in line on our system as the most constrained beyond New York, which, of course, we sold a couple of years ago. And New England, which we're well on the way to solving with these 3 projects, AIM, Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast, Philly is probably the next biggest constrained area. But we probably have a project that's in the $1 billion range, maybe 0.5 Bcf a day to the Philly load. And we'll see what this brings on May 8. To your question on getting things in service quicker, we -- I think we all know the regulatory process and the permitting process isn't getting any easier as time goes on nor is it any easier as you head north and east in the U.S. So difficult to see where we can get things in quicker, but I do think we have realistic time lines on these projects."

As you know, the challenge, I'll call it, we've had recent oil at $60, but typically in the first quarter closer to $50. Even with the differential, I think that you still have a number of producers, Darren, reeling from uncertainty. And some of those projects, they start to get pretty sizable from a CapEx perspective, particularly on the twinning side and would take decade-plus commitments. And I think producers have just been very hesitant to do that. That being said, I think we continue -- you'll see us continue to push enhancement-type projects as well as the major projects. I think the issue is not if, it's just when. So from a timing perspective, obviously, if you do a twinning, that has much different regulatory implications and if you just doing enhancements to basically get up to the existing capacity. But we're looking to work with other partners. We're looking to do enhancements and even greenfield, if necessary, to meet the customer needs. But I think the type of projects you see like the enhancement or you had 25,000 or 30,000 barrels a day is much more in line with what producers are willing to sign up today. So every month, we see increase in the price of oil. I think the likelihood of those projects coming back fully on the radar screen and we believe that will definitely allow us to secure those big projects before the end of the decade."

But you point out a good fact and the prices aren't going down in terms of the volumes of gas. In fact, it's probably surprising to a lot of people. April saw Western Canada produce 15 Bs [ph] a day, which is the probably -- which is the highest production rate in a decade -- or 8 to 10 years. So we'll look at those. I think again the issue is at those prices, as you can imagine folks like ourselves, the margins are extremely small, hence, our likelihood of earning more like $30 million in cash as opposed to what we've seen in some of the other years. So opportunity there, I think the price signals suggest that people probably don't want to commit for those long term.

I think the #1 competitive advantage is the one you just point to with Eversource and Grid. As we've been talking about a little bit on this call, John, is that you know how difficult it is to place assets into service. We take great pride on the fact that we've been in those areas for half a century or so. But the Eversource and Grid folks have been there even longer and this is a ground game, and being able to understand the needs, how to use existing assets to maximize capabilities and yet minimize new infrastructure is a real advantage to have those folks along. And then, of course, we would expect them to help support the pipeline through contracts as well. And ultimately, there needs to be, beyond on the FERC approvals, there needs to be state approvals on some of this and they obviously have probably the best insight from that perspective. So volume, in terms of 4.8 million versus 6.5 million on the ground, existing assets, working as partnership, regulatory and our ability to put pipes in the ground, all add up to, we think, check, check, check from a competitive perspective, our pipeline proposals versus some others."

Thanks for joining us. Before Pat speaks to the numbers for the quarter, I thought I'd take a little bit of an opportunity to give you my perspectives on the results and give you a quick update",680,"Well, thanks every much, Julie, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Before Pat speaks to the numbers for the quarter, I thought I'd take a little bit of an opportunity to give you my perspectives on the results and give you a quick update on our structuring efforts at DCP Midstream. So let's start there. As you recall in February, we discussed that we were working with Phillips 66 to overcome the short-term challenges at DCP caused by the rapid drop in commodity prices and that we're also working to ensure that over the long term, DCP and DPM were set up in a manner that provides the best opportunity for us to realize their full value. While there is still work to be completed, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress on both fronts during this quarter. To address its short-term needs, DCP Midstream worked with its bank group to amend its bank revolver, and DCP has also taken action to reduce corporate costs and its capital budget. And of course, we continue to work on a longer-term structural solution. 
As we drive to the right solution, let me reiterate our structuring objectives. First, we are working to ensure that the entire DCP complex is structured to achieve an optimal balance of fee-based and commodity-exposed contracts. Second, we expect to establish a foundation of sustainable cash flows and distributions for our public unitholders, while retaining the upside that will occur when commodity prices ultimately recover for the sponsors, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And third, we will ensure that any ultimate structuring still allows the DCP complex to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing and that it positions DCP to efficiently finance that growth. So work continues on this front, and we expect to have a solution to share with you in the coming months. 
Moving to our first quarter at Spectra Energy. We delivered a strong start to the year. We exceeded our plan expectations for the quarter, even overcoming a lower-than-anticipated commodity environment and a weaker Canadian dollar. The quarter, I think, was a good example of the stability and sustainability of our overall earnings and cash generation. Our base businesses continued to perform very well, and we achieved record deliveries this past winter on our major pipeline systems, Texas Eastern, Algonquin, Union's Dawn-Parkway system and T-South in Western Canada. That kind of utilization bodes well for future contract renewals and demonstrates the ongoing need for additional pipeline infrastructure that we will build for our customers' growing demands. And with the strength of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids business, SEP continues to roll along delivering solid results in its own right as it brings new expansion projects into service. As you know, SEP's fee-based earnings have virtually no volume or commodity exposure, a unique and attractive benefit for SEP unitholders and Spectra Energy shareholders in these times. 
Thanks to a colder-than-normal winter, Union Gas beat its own expectations for the quarter. The occurred despite the lower Canadian dollar. Western Canada continues to perform well in both a tough gas drilling and currency environment. And DCP's earnings were in line with its first quarter plans as it did a good job overcoming lower-than-anticipated commodity prices. The DCP management team has done an excellent job of proactively managing through the current environment by reducing costs and enhancing operating efficiencies to ensure they meet their expectations.
Very importantly, we are also ahead of expectations from a cash generation perspective. This again underlines the strength of Spectra Energy's portfolio of businesses and our ability to consistently generate strong cash flows in various market cycles. It also reinforces my own confidence in our ability to deliver annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share, while maintaining coverage at or above 1x.
So I'll be back shortly to talk about the excellent progress we're making on our Drive to 35. But for now, I'll turn things over to Pat to talk about the detailed financial results for the first quarter compared to last year. Pat?"

As you've seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's E",1204,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the significant drop in commodity prices combined with a weaker Canadian dollar. And while we experienced another cold winter, weather was generally comparable across both periods. SEP's ongoing EBITDA was up almost 8% over last year's first quarter, reflecting increased earnings from expansion projects and helped by virtually no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations.
So I would draw your attention to the bottom of Slide 4 as we take a look at the drivers for our EBITDA results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, which is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses. U.S. Transmission's ongoing EBITDA of $398 million was $24 million higher than in the first quarter of 2014. This quarter's results primarily reflect increased earnings from 2 expansion projects we placed into service last year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South as well as the Kingsport project that commenced service earlier this year. 2015 results exclude a $9 million special item related to an impairment of Ozark Gas Gathering assets. Our Liquids business reported first quarter EBITDA of $64 million compared with $58 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings from the Sand Hills natural gas liquids pipeline, reflecting increased volumes year-over-year. The Express and Platte crude pipelines also continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, which were in line with our expectations. 
Distribution reported first quarter EBITDA of $192 million compared with $226 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due mainly to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was 13% weaker this quarter. Also, first quarter 2014 results included regulatory decisions from the Ontario Energy Board that in the aggregate provided a $10 million benefit to the segments' 2014 results. Without those items, distribution's EBITDA was in line with last year, so the base business continues to be strong. 
Western Canada transmission and processing reported EBITDA for the quarter of $161 million compared with $237 million in 2014. As expected, earnings were lower at Empress, reflecting weaker commodity prices, primarily for propane, which was about 70% below 2014's price levels. Furthermore, we recorded a noncash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustment of negative $22 million. But as we discussed last quarter, with the implementation of a risk management program at Empress, we are focused on stabilizing cash flows. We said we expect Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash for the year and we are on track to achieve that result. Western Canada's earnings were also lower due to the weaker Canadian dollar. But as a reminder, while this change in the currency brought with it a headwind that reduced EBITDA by a combined $43 million in our 2 Canadian business segments, we are partially hedged on a net income basis. The FX effect on net income was $20 million in the first quarter of this year for our Canadian businesses. 
Moving to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing earnings was a negative $14 million in the quarter, which was $144 million less than in 2014. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices and a decrease in equity gains associated with the issuance of partnership units by DCP Midstream Partners. These decreases were partially offset by earnings from expansions, the improved operating efficiencies and cost savings from various initiatives. While we would certainly prefer a stronger commodity environment, DCP has done a great job of controlling what they can and meeting the business budget goals in an environment where commodity prices are down 50% from last year's levels. DCP's 2015 ongoing results exclude a special item of $3 million for our share of costs related to organizational changes that were recognized during the quarter. Additional costs related to these changes will be incurred through the remainder of this year. So in total, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter as expected. Importantly, however, despite both commodity prices and currency being weaker than we had forecast, these results exceeded our expectations for the 2015 quarter.
The same holds true for our distributable cash flow, so let's take a look at our DCF schedules, beginning with SEP. SEP's standalone disputable cash flow for the quarter was $354 million, $30 million more than the same quarter last year with distribution coverage of 1.5x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to EBITDA generated by U.S. Transmission from expansion projects and higher volumes at Sand Hills pipeline in the Liquids business. For the full year, we expect SEP's coverage to be 1.1x in line with our 2015 forecast. We remain confident in our ability to increase our quarterly distributions by $0.0125 per unit, while maintaining our distribution coverage at or above 1x. SEP paid general partner and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $52 million and $142 million, respectively. 
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow. At SE, distributable cash flow was $578 million for the quarter compared with $631 million in last year's quarter. Coverage was a very strong 2.3x, and DCF per share was $0.86. Now just as a reminder, with some seasonality in our cash flows, our coverage will be lower in the second and third quarters. But as we laid out in February, we continue to expect coverage to be 1.2x on a full year basis. 
While our EBITDA was down period-to-period, so were our cash taxes. We received a higher tax refund in the first quarter of 2015 due to the approval of bonus depreciation late in 2014. And our interest expense was lower compared to last year, mainly due to the weaker Canadian dollar as well as lower average long-term debt balances. As you would expect, given the level of growth we're pursuing and achieving. We've been busy on the financing front. We closed out our $400 million ATM continuous equity offering at SEP and initiated a new $500 million offering, which we expect to utilize throughout the year. Also in the first quarter, SEP successfully completed a $1 billion debt issuance at attractive rates in furtherance of our efforts to efficiently fund our growth investments. Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of March 31. So while we know it's early in the year, we're feeling very good about the how the businesses continue to perform. Despite commodity prices and the Canadian dollar being weaker than we had anticipated, when we put our budgets together, we are ahead of where we thought we would be at this time in terms of both EBITDA and distributable about cash flow. And these are both positive indicators of a strong year ahead. We are pleased with how we started the year and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year.
So with that, let me turn things back to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you've just heard, Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners' first quarter results really benefited from new assets we put in the ground last year. And this ability to consistently deliver our projects into service as planned allows us to take advantage of opportunities to grow, reach new markets and enhance our pipeline systems. So let's take a look at how we're doing on that front. We have several projects scheduled to go into service this year. So let me begin with those.
At U.S. Transmission, 2 projects, OPEN and Uniontown to Gas City, are under construction and scheduled to commence service in the fourth quarter. The OPEN project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to southern markets and the Uniontown to Gas City project will deliver gas to the Midwest. Together, these 2 projects, along with TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which you'll recall we brought into service last year, represent about 2/3 of the 2.4 Bcf a day in projects that will fully transform Texas Eastern to a bidirectional system by 2017. At our Liquids segment, we are constructing the Red Lake project to expand the reach of Sand Hills to access growing Permian Basin production. The project is scheduled to go into service during the second quarter. We're also on track with the construction of our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project, which is the first of several expansions we're advancing along the Dawn-Parkway path at Union Gas. This project is scheduled to go into service during the fourth quarter of this year. 
In February, DCP put its Keathley Canyon connector gathering line in the Gulf of Mexico into service. This project is part of the Discovery joint venture, which is a jointly owned operation between DCP Midstream Partners and Williams Partners. And DCP has a couple of other projects, including the Lucerne 2 and Zia II Plants, which are scheduled to be put into service later this year as well. 
All totaled by the year-end, we -- by this year-end, we have brought in -- or will have brought in an excess of $2 billion of projects into service, adding additional earnings and cash flow growth in 2016 and beyond. Other projects we have in execution are also proceeding very well. At SEP, we continue making progress on our NEXUS project and anticipate filing a formal FERC application later this year. We completed a subsequent open season for the project, adding upstream capacity on Texas Eastern for up to 950 million cubic feet per day and creating a direct path for Marcellus and Utica supply to reach NEXUS markets. 
During the quarter, the AIM Project in New England received its FERC certificate and will begin construction shortly. The project is 100% subscribed by New England's major local distribution companies and is on track for an in-service date in the second half of 2016. The Atlantic Bridge project continues to move forward, and we will file its formal FERC application later this year. The FERC approval process is the last step before building the project, which has a final scope of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day and a capital cost of about $650 million. This project's scope will ensure we meet the needs of the LDC and industrial customers who require service in 2017. Our Gulf Markets, East Tennessee, Loudon and Sabal Trail projects are all on track for their respective in-service dates. And you may have seen that Duke Energy announced it is taking a 7.5% investment interest in Sabal Trail, joining Spectra Energy and NextEra as project owners as expected. We continue to be on track to secure regulatory approvals on this project by early 2016 and meet our 2017 in-service date. On another front, just last week, we received regulatory approval from the Ontario Energy Board for the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project. So that project remains nicely on track as well. And work continues on the 2 new projects in Western Canada to expand our BC pipeline. Jackfish Lake is a supply push project, and the Reliability and Maintainability Project, or the RAM Project, is a demand pull project. Both of these pipeline expansions are on track to be in service in 2017. Importantly during the quarter, we moved a new project, Express Enhancement, into execution. This $135 million project is underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts and will maximize the system throughput on our Express pipeline through the addition of on-system terminal and -- terminalling and storage assets. The Express Enhancement project is expected to go into service in 2016. So we have an impressive slate of projects in execution, projects that will deliver the earnings and cash flow we've had in our 3-year plan. But we're looking well beyond the 3-year horizon, of course, and we have a healthy backlog of projects and opportunities that lead to continued growth and value creation. And we're working diligently to move those projects forward. With more than $7.5 billion in service since 2013, more than $9 billion of expansion projects in execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our pledge to secure $35 billion of expansion projects through the end of the decade. 
Let's take a look at some of our projects that are in development. I'll begin with our Access Northeast project at SEP. While AIM and Atlantic Bridge have primarily been contracted by LDCs, Access Northeast will mainly serve the electric power market. As many of you know, Access Northeast will improve electric reliability in New England by helping supply the vast majority of the region's most efficient gas-powered generation. The project will expand our Algonquin and Maritimes & Northeast systems and utilize their existing footprints. We're developing the project with Eversource and National Grid, who give us a strong competitive advantage and valued insight as, together, they serve 4.8 million of the 6.5 million electric customers in the region. The open season for Access Northeast ended on May 1 and we're moving to finalize and sign binding contracts with customers. Not surprisingly, we expect that Eversource and National Grid will be key customers and will contract for a significant portion of the project's capacity. We anticipate moving Access Northeast into execution later this year.
As mentioned earlier, our Northeast pipeline set new delivery records this past winter, a sure sign that additional infrastructure is needed. We believe that the region's policymakers understand that New England needs more low-cost gas to ensure reliability, winter time price stability and the region's competitiveness as evidenced by the recent New England governor's summit meeting on energy. 
In addition to the Access Northeast project, we've already conducted several open seasons this year to projects that would further connect Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Texas Eastern's proposed Lebanon Extension project will provide shippers with the opportunity to obtain firm transportation service to deliver new natural gas supplies to markets in the Midwest U.S. We concluded our open season for the project in late March, and we're targeting a project of about 100 million cubic feet per day. And we expect this project to go into service during the second half of 2017. Our open season for the Marcellus to market expansion of Texas Eastern closed April 10 and results indicate strong interest from shippers for firm transportation that will deliver new incremental production to markets in the Northeast. The target in-service date for the Marcellus to market project is the second half of 2017. 
Our proposed Greater Philadelphia Expansion project extends our Texas Eastern system to provide shippers with firm transportation to delivery points along or near the existing Philadelphia Lateral. The project's open season closed this week, so we will be analyzing the market interest and could be targeting an expansion in the region as early as the second half of 2018. These 3 Appalachian expansion projects represent an incremental growth CapEx opportunity of $750 million to $1.5 billion, over and above what we already have in execution. At Union Gas, our 2017 Dawn-Parkway project recently completed its open season and received strong customer support. Commercial contracts are being finalized, and we expect to file this project with the OEB midyear, at which point we will also move it into execution. And we continue to see demand growth in Ontario. So we're exploring the possibility of further expansion of the Dawn-Parkway system in 2018.
Today, you'll see in Western Canada that we're announcing a binding open season on our T-North pipeline system in Northeast BC. This is a supply push project and is driven by Spectra Energy's ability to add timely capacity at competitive rates to serve this important region of Western Canada.
And finally, work continues on the Westcoast Connector project in Western Canada, which is well positioned with its approved corridor for 2 pipelines. It's important to note that the Westcoast Connector is the only project with an approved multi-pipe corridor in British Columbia. Given the current low global LNG pricing environment, we believe that this unique position provides attractive cost synergies for any future BC LNG investments.
So we're off to a good start for the year and we know our investors expect nothing less from us, given our significant fee-based business model. Spectra Energy has demonstrated its ability to succeed in the midst of various business cycles. We've got a superior asset footprint that connects us not only to premium supply basins, but also to growing demand markets, a great portfolio of high-performing fee-based businesses and a powerful platform for ongoing expansion. As indicated, when we rolled out our plan in February, we have virtually no volume or commodity exposure at SEP. And at Spectra Energy, our incremental commodity exposure, as it affects our DCF, is extremely limited as well. Both of these advantages are reflected in our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite lower-than-anticipated pricing. 
Our outlook for capital expansion continues to be very positive, and we've already contractually secured a significant portion of our Drive to 35. Lastly and most importantly, our solid base businesses, plus the growth we've already secured, support our commitment to grow our dividend by $0.14 per share annually with coverage at or above 1x.

And New England, which we're well on the way to solving with these 3 projects, AIM, Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast, Philly is probably the next biggest constrained area. But we probably have a project that's in the $1 billion range, maybe 0.5 Bcf a day to the Philly load. And we'll see the season brings on May 8. To your question on getting things in service quicker, we -- I think we all know the regulatory process and the permitting process isn't getting any easier as time goes on nor is it any easier as you head north and east in the U.S. So difficult to see where we can get things in quicker, but I do think we have realistic time lines on these projects."

As you know, the challenge, I'll call it, we've had recent oil at $60, but typically in the first quarter closer to $50. Even with the differential, I think that you still have a number of producers, Darren, reeling from uncertainty. And some of those projects, they start to get pretty sizable from a CapEx perspective, particularly on the twinning side and would take decade-plus commitments. And I think producers have just been very hesitant to do that. That being said, I think we continue -- you'll see us continue to push enhancement-type projects as well as the major projects. I think the issue is not if, it's just when. So from a timing perspective, obviously, if you do a twinning, that has much different regulatory implications than if you are just doing enhancements to basically get up to the existing capacity. But we're looking to work with other partners. We're looking to do enhancements and even greenfield, if necessary, to meet the customer needs. But I think the type of projects you see, like the enhancement where you add 25,000 or 30,000 barrels a day, is much more in line with what producers are willing to sign up today. So every month we see an increase in the price of oil, I think the likelihood of those projects coming back fully on the radar screen and, we believe, that will definitely allow us to secure those big projects before the end of the decade."

But you point out a good fact and the supplies aren't going down in terms of the volumes of gas. In fact, it's probably surprising to a lot of people. April saw Western Canada produce 15 Bs [ph] a day, which is the probably -- which is the highest production rate in a decade -- or 8 to 10 years. So we'll look at those. I think again the issue is at those prices, as you can imagine folks like ourselves, the margins are extremely small, hence, our likelihood of earning more like $30 million in cash as opposed to what we've seen in some of the other years. So opportunity there, I think the price signals suggest that people probably don't want to commit for those long term.

I think the #1 competitive advantage is the one you just point to with Eversource and Grid. As we've been talking about a little bit on this call, John, is that you know how difficult it is to place assets into service. We take great pride on the fact that we've been in those areas for half a century or so. But the Eversource and Grid folks have been there even longer and this is a ground game, and being able to understand the needs, how to use existing assets to maximize capabilities and yet minimize new infrastructure is a real advantage to have those folks along. And then, of course, we would expect them to help support the pipeline through contracts as well. And ultimately, there needs to be, beyond the FERC approvals, there needs to be state approvals on some of this and they obviously have probably the best insight from that perspective. So volume, in terms of 4.8 million versus 6.5 million on the ground, existing assets, working as partnership, regulatory and our ability to put pipes in the ground, all add up to, we think, check, check, check from a competitive perspective, our pipeline proposals versus some others."

Before Pat speaks to the numbers for the quarter, I thought I'd take a little bit of an opportunity to give you my perspectives on the results and give you a quick update on our structuring efforts at DCP Midstream. So let's start there. As you recall in February, we discussed that we were working with Phillips 66 to overcome the short-term challenges at DCP caused by the rapid drop in commodity prices and that we're also working to ensure that over the long term, DCP and DPM were set up in a manner that provides the best opportunity for us to realize their full value. While there is still work to be completed, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress on both fronts during this quarter. To address its short-term needs, DCP Midstream worked with its bank group to amend its bank revolver, and DCP has also taken action to reduce corporate costs and its capital budget. And of course, we continue to work on a longer-term structural solution. 
As we drive to the right solution, let me reiterate our structuring objectives. First, we are working to ensure that the entire DCP complex is structured to achieve an optimal balance of fee-based and commodity-exposed contracts. Second, we expect to establish a foundation of sustainable cash flows and distributions for our public unitholders, while retaining the upside that will occur when commodity prices ultimately recover for the sponsors, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And third, we will ensure that any ultimate structuring still allows the DCP complex to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing and that it positions DCP to efficiently finance that growth. So work continues on this front, and we expect to have a solution to share with you in the coming months. 
Moving to our first quarter at Spectra Energy. We delivered a strong start to the year. We exceeded our plan expectations for the quarter, even overcoming a lower-than-anticipated commodity environment and a weaker Canadian dollar. The quarter, I think, was a good example of the stability and sustainability of our overall earnings and cash generation. Our base businesses continued to perform very well, and we achieved record deliveries this past winter on our major pipeline systems, Texas Eastern, Algonquin, Union's Dawn-Parkway system and T-South in Western Canada. That kind of utilization bodes well for future contract renewals and demonstrates the ongoing need for additional pipeline infrastructure that we will build for our customers' growing demands. And with the strength of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids business, SEP continues to roll along delivering solid results in its own right as it brings new expansion projects into service. As you know, SEP's fee-based earnings have virtually no volume or commodity exposure, a unique and attractive benefit for SEP unitholders and Spectra Energy shareholders in these times. 
Thanks to a colder-than-normal winter, Union Gas beat its own expectations for the quarter. The occurred despite the lower Canadian dollar. Western Canada continues to perform well in both a tough gas drilling and currency environment. And DCP's earnings were in line with its first quarter plans as it did a good job overcoming lower-than-anticipated commodity prices. The DCP management team has done an excellent job of proactively managing through the current environment by reducing costs and enhancing operating efficiencies to ensure they meet their expectations.
Very importantly, we are also ahead of expectations from a cash generation perspective. This again underlines the strength of Spectra Energy's portfolio of businesses and our ability to consistently generate strong cash flows in various market cycles. It also reinforces my own confidence in our ability to deliver annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share, while maintaining coverage at or above 1x.
So I'll be back shortly to talk about the excellent progress we're making on our Drive to 35. But for now, I'll turn things over to Pat to talk about the detailed financial results for the first quarter compared to last year. Pat?"
610501,290663859,807806,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's E",1204,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our earnings release, we delivered solid first quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $788 million at Spectra Energy and $445 million at Spectra Energy Partners. As expected, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the significant drop in commodity prices combined with a weaker Canadian dollar. And while we experienced another cold winter, weather was generally comparable across both periods. SEP's ongoing EBITDA was up almost 8% over last year's first quarter, reflecting increased earnings from expansion projects and helped by virtually no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations.
So I would draw your attention to the bottom of Slide 4 as we take a look at the drivers for our EBITDA results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, which is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses. U.S. Transmission's ongoing EBITDA of $398 million was $24 million higher than in the first quarter of 2014. This quarter's results primarily reflect increased earnings from 2 expansion projects we placed into service last year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South as well as the Kingsport project that commenced service earlier this year. 2015 results exclude a $9 million special item related to an impairment of Ozark Gas Gathering assets. Our Liquids business reported first quarter EBITDA of $64 million compared with $58 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings from the Sand Hills natural gas liquids pipeline, reflecting increased volumes year-over-year. The Express and Platte crude pipelines also continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, which were in line with our expectations. 
Distribution reported first quarter EBITDA of $192 million compared with $226 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due mainly to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was 13% weaker this quarter. Also, first quarter 2014 results included regulatory decisions from the Ontario Energy Board that in the aggregate provided a $10 million benefit to the segments' 2014 results. Without those items, distribution's EBITDA was in line with last year, so the base business continues to be strong. 
Western Canada transmission and processing reported EBITDA for the quarter of $161 million compared with $237 million in 2014. As expected, earnings were lower at Empress, reflecting weaker commodity prices, primarily for propane, which was about 70% below 2014's price levels. Furthermore, we recorded a noncash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustment of negative $22 million. But as we discussed last quarter, with the implementation of a risk management program at Empress, we are focused on stabilizing cash flows. We said we expect Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash for the year and we are on track to achieve that result. Western Canada's earnings were also lower due to the weaker Canadian dollar. But as a reminder, while this change in the currency brought with it a headwind that reduced EBITDA by a combined $43 million in our 2 Canadian business segments, we are partially hedged on a net income basis. The FX effect on net income was $20 million in the first quarter of this year for our Canadian businesses. 
Moving to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing earnings was a negative $14 million in the quarter, which was $144 million less than in 2014. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices and a decrease in equity gains associated with the issuance of partnership units by DCP Midstream Partners. These decreases were partially offset by earnings from expansions, the improved operating efficiencies and cost savings from various initiatives. While we would certainly prefer a stronger commodity environment, DCP has done a great job of controlling what they can and meeting the business budget goals in an environment where commodity prices are down 50% from last year's levels. DCP's 2015 ongoing results exclude a special item of $3 million for our share of costs related to organizational changes that were recognized during the quarter. Additional costs related to these changes will be incurred through the remainder of this year. So in total, Spectra Energy's EBITDA was down quarter-over-quarter as expected. Importantly, however, despite both commodity prices and currency being weaker than we had forecast, these results exceeded our expectations for the 2015 quarter.
The same holds true for our distributable cash flow, so let's take a look at our DCF schedules, beginning with SEP. SEP's standalone disputable cash flow for the quarter was $354 million, $30 million more than the same quarter last year with distribution coverage of 1.5x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to EBITDA generated by U.S. Transmission from expansion projects and higher volumes at Sand Hills pipeline in the Liquids business. For the full year, we expect SEP's coverage to be 1.1x in line with our 2015 forecast. We remain confident in our ability to increase our quarterly distributions by $0.0125 per unit, while maintaining our distribution coverage at or above 1x. SEP paid general partner and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $52 million and $142 million, respectively. 
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow. At SE, distributable cash flow was $578 million for the quarter compared with $631 million in last year's quarter. Coverage was a very strong 2.3x, and DCF per share was $0.86. Now just as a reminder, with some seasonality in our cash flows, our coverage will be lower in the second and third quarters. But as we laid out in February, we continue to expect coverage to be 1.2x on a full year basis. 
While our EBITDA was down period-to-period, so were our cash taxes. We received a higher tax refund in the first quarter of 2015 due to the approval of bonus depreciation late in 2014. And our interest expense was lower compared to last year, mainly due to the weaker Canadian dollar as well as lower average long-term debt balances. As you would expect, given the level of growth we're pursuing and achieving. We've been busy on the financing front. We closed out our $400 million ATM continuous equity offering at SEP and initiated a new $500 million offering, which we expect to utilize throughout the year. Also in the first quarter, SEP successfully completed a $1 billion debt issuance at attractive rates in furtherance of our efforts to efficiently fund our growth investments. Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of March 31. So while we know it's early in the year, we're feeling very good about the how the businesses continue to perform. Despite commodity prices and the Canadian dollar being weaker than we had anticipated, when we put our budgets together, we are ahead of where we thought we would be at this time in terms of both EBITDA and distributable about cash flow. And these are both positive indicators of a strong year ahead. We are pleased with how we started the year and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year.
So with that, let me turn things back to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."
610501,290663859,807806,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks very much, Pat.

As you've just heard, Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners' first quarter results really benefited from new assets we put in the ground last year. And this ability to consistently deliver our projects into service as planned allows us to take advantage of opportunities to grow, reach new markets and enhance our pipeline systems. So let's take a look at how we're doing on that front. We have several projects scheduled to go into service this year. So let me begin with those.
At U.S. Transmission, 2 projects, OPEN and Uniontown to Gas City, are under construction and scheduled to commence service in the fourth quarter. The OPEN project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to southern markets and the Uniontown to Gas City project will deliver gas to the Midwest. Together, these 2 projects, along with TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, which you'll recall we brought into service last year, represent about 2/3 of the 2.4 Bcf a day in projects that will fully transform Texas Eastern to a bidirectional system by 2017. At our Liquids segment, we are constructing the Red Lake project to expand the reach of Sand Hills to access growing Permian Basin production. The project is scheduled to go into service during the second quarter. We're also on track with the construction of our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project, which is the first of several expansions we're advancing along the Dawn-Parkway path at Union Gas. This project is scheduled to go into service during the fourth quarter of this year. 
In February, DCP put its Keathley Canyon connector gathering line in the Gulf of Mexico into service. This project is part of the Discovery joint venture, which is a jointly owned operation between DCP Midstream Partners and Williams Partners. And DCP has a couple of other projects, including the Lucerne 2 and Zia II Plants, which are scheduled to be put into service later this year as well. 
All totaled by the year-end, we -- by this year-end, we have brought in -- or will have brought in an excess of $2 billion of projects into service, adding additional earnings and cash flow growth in 2016 and beyond. Other projects we have in execution are also proceeding very well. At SEP, we continue making progress on our NEXUS project and anticipate filing a formal FERC application later this year. We completed a subsequent open season for the project, adding upstream capacity on Texas Eastern for up to 950 million cubic feet per day and creating a direct path for Marcellus and Utica supply to reach NEXUS markets. 
During the quarter, the AIM Project in New England received its FERC certificate and will begin construction shortly. The project is 100% subscribed by New England's major local distribution companies and is on track for an in-service date in the second half of 2016. The Atlantic Bridge project continues to move forward, and we will file its formal FERC application later this year. The FERC approval process is the last step before building the project, which has a final scope of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day and a capital cost of about $650 million. This project's scope will ensure we meet the needs of the LDC and industrial customers who require service in 2017. Our Gulf Markets, East Tennessee, Loudon and Sabal Trail projects are all on track for their respective in-service dates. And you may have seen that Duke Energy announced it is taking a 7.5% investment interest in Sabal Trail, joining Spectra Energy and NextEra as project owners as expected. We continue to be on track to secure regulatory approvals on this project by early 2016 and meet our 2017 in-service date. On another front, just last week, we received regulatory approval from the Ontario Energy Board for the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project. So that project remains nicely on track as well. And work continues on the 2 new projects in Western Canada to expand our BC pipeline. Jackfish Lake is a supply push project, and the Reliability and Maintainability Project, or the RAM Project, is a demand pull project. Both of these pipeline expansions are on track to be in service in 2017. Importantly during the quarter, we moved a new project, Express Enhancement, into execution. This $135 million project is underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts and will maximize the system throughput on our Express pipeline through the addition of on-system terminal and -- terminalling and storage assets. The Express Enhancement project is expected to go into service in 2016. So we have an impressive slate of projects in execution, projects that will deliver the earnings and cash flow we've had in our 3-year plan. But we're looking well beyond the 3-year horizon, of course, and we have a healthy backlog of projects and opportunities that lead to continued growth and value creation. And we're working diligently to move those projects forward. With more than $7.5 billion in service since 2013, more than $9 billion of expansion projects in execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our pledge to secure $35 billion of expansion projects through the end of the decade. 
Let's take a look at some of our projects that are in development. I'll begin with our Access Northeast project at SEP. While AIM and Atlantic Bridge have primarily been contracted by LDCs, Access Northeast will mainly serve the electric power market. As many of you know, Access Northeast will improve electric reliability in New England by helping supply the vast majority of the region's most efficient gas-powered generation. The project will expand our Algonquin and Maritimes & Northeast systems and utilize their existing footprints. We're developing the project with Eversource and National Grid, who give us a strong competitive advantage and valued insight as, together, they serve 4.8 million of the 6.5 million electric customers in the region. The open season for Access Northeast ended on May 1 and we're moving to finalize and sign binding contracts with customers. Not surprisingly, we expect that Eversource and National Grid will be key customers and will contract for a significant portion of the project's capacity. We anticipate moving Access Northeast into execution later this year.
As mentioned earlier, our Northeast pipeline set new delivery records this past winter, a sure sign that additional infrastructure is needed. We believe that the region's policymakers understand that New England needs more low-cost gas to ensure reliability, winter time price stability and the region's competitiveness as evidenced by the recent New England governor's summit meeting on energy. 
In addition to the Access Northeast project, we've already conducted several open seasons this year to projects that would further connect Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Texas Eastern's proposed Lebanon Extension project will provide shippers with the opportunity to obtain firm transportation service to deliver new natural gas supplies to markets in the Midwest U.S. We concluded our open season for the project in late March, and we're targeting a project of about 100 million cubic feet per day. And we expect this project to go into service during the second half of 2017. Our open season for the Marcellus to market expansion of Texas Eastern closed April 10 and results indicate strong interest from shippers for firm transportation that will deliver new incremental production to markets in the Northeast. The target in-service date for the Marcellus to market project is the second half of 2017. 
Our proposed Greater Philadelphia Expansion project extends our Texas Eastern system to provide shippers with firm transportation to delivery points along or near the existing Philadelphia Lateral. The project's open season closed this week, so we will be analyzing the market interest and could be targeting an expansion in the region as early as the second half of 2018. These 3 Appalachian expansion projects represent an incremental growth CapEx opportunity of $750 million to $1.5 billion, over and above what we already have in execution. At Union Gas, our 2017 Dawn-Parkway project recently completed its open season and received strong customer support. Commercial contracts are being finalized, and we expect to file this project with the OEB midyear, at which point we will also move it into execution. And we continue to see demand growth in Ontario. So we're exploring the possibility of further expansion of the Dawn-Parkway system in 2018.
Today, you'll see in Western Canada that we're announcing a binding open season on our T-North pipeline system in Northeast BC. This is a supply push project and is driven by Spectra Energy's ability to add timely capacity at competitive rates to serve this important region of Western Canada.
And finally, work continues on the Westcoast Connector project in Western Canada, which is well positioned with its approved corridor for 2 pipelines. It's important to note that the Westcoast Connector is the only project with an approved multi-pipe corridor in British Columbia. Given the current low global LNG pricing environment, we believe that this unique position provides attractive cost synergies for any future BC LNG investments.
So we're off to a good start for the year and we know our investors expect nothing less from us, given our significant fee-based business model. Spectra Energy has demonstrated its ability to succeed in the midst of various business cycles. We've got a superior asset footprint that connects us not only to premium supply basins, but also to growing demand markets, a great portfolio of high-performing fee-based businesses and a powerful platform for ongoing expansion. As indicated, when we rolled out our plan in February, we have virtually no volume or commodity exposure at SEP. And at Spectra Energy, our incremental commodity exposure, as it affects our DCF, is extremely limited as well. Both of these advantages are reflected in our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite lower-than-anticipated pricing. 
Our outlook for capital expansion continues to be very positive, and we've already contractually secured a significant portion of our Drive to 35. Lastly and most importantly, our solid base businesses, plus the growth we've already secured, support our commitment to grow our dividend by $0.14 per share annually with coverage at or above 1x.
So thanks very much for joining us, and I'll turn things over to Julie, so we can take your questions."

If you look at what you're doing with that Lebanon Expansion and the Marcellus to market expansion on Texas Eastern and then, of course, in Philadelphia, obviously, there's some variability in terms of CapEx spend.

And New England, which we're well on the way to solving with these 3 projects, AIM, Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast, Philly is probably the next biggest constrained area. But we probably have a project that's in the $1 billion range, maybe 0.5 Bcf a day to the Philly load. And we'll see the season brings on May 8. To your question on getting things in service quicker, we -- I think we all know the regulatory process and the permitting process isn't getting any easier as time goes on nor is it any easier as you head north and east in the U.S. So difficult to see where we can get things in quicker, but I do think we have realistic time lines on these projects."

As you know, the challenge, I'll call it, we've had recent oil at $60, but typically in the first quarter closer to $50. Even with the differential, I think that you still have a number of producers, Darren, reeling from uncertainty. And some of those projects, they start to get pretty sizable from a CapEx perspective, particularly on the twinning side and would take decade-plus commitments. And I think producers have just been very hesitant to do that. That being said, I think we continue -- you'll see us continue to push enhancement-type projects as well as the major projects. I think the issue is not if, it's just when. So from a timing perspective, obviously, if you do a twinning, that has much different regulatory implications than if you are just doing enhancements to basically get up to the existing capacity. But we're looking to work with other partners. We're looking to do enhancements and even greenfield, if necessary, to meet the customer needs. But I think the type of projects you see, like the enhancement where you add 25,000 or 30,000 barrels a day, is much more in line with what producers are willing to sign up today. So every month we see an increase in the price of oil, I think the likelihood of those projects coming back fully on the radar screen and, we believe, that will definitely allow us to secure those big projects before the end of the decade."

April saw Western Canada produce 15 Bs [ph] a day, which is the probably -- which is the highest production rate in a decade -- or 8 to 10 years. So we'll look at those. I think again the issue is at those prices, as you can imagine folks like ourselves, the margins are extremely small, hence, our likelihood of earning more like $30 million in cash as opposed to what we've seen in some of the other years. So opportunity there, I think the price signals suggest that people probably don't want to commit for those long term.

I think the #1 competitive advantage is the one you just point to with Eversource and Grid. As we've been talking about a little bit on this call, John, is that you know how difficult it is to place assets into service. We take great pride on the fact that we've been in those areas for half a century or so. But the Eversource and Grid folks have been there even longer and this is a ground game, and being able to understand the needs, how to use existing assets to maximize capabilities and yet minimize new infrastructure is a real advantage to have those folks along. And then, of course, we would expect them to help support the pipeline through contracts as well. And ultimately, there needs to be, beyond the FERC approvals, there needs to be state approvals on some of this and they obviously have probably the best insight from that perspective. So volume, in terms of 4.8 million versus 6.5 million on the ground, existing assets, working as partnership, regulatory and our ability to put pipes in the ground, all add up to, we think, check, check, check from a competitive perspective, our pipeline proposals versus some others."

As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered very strong ongoing EBITDA for the quarter. But before I get into the details of those results, I want to discuss some special items we recorded during the quarter as shown on Slide 3.
There were 3 special items which lowered reported EBITDA by $217 million or $0.20 per share. As you can see on this slide, only 1 of these items affected DCF by $11 million. The first item is $194 million pretax, noncash charge or $122 million after-tax, which represents our 50% share of a goodwill impairment at DCP.
The second item also is associated with DCP and is a separate tax noncash charge of $12 million related to our share of a loss on the sale of an asset during the quarter.
Lastly, Western Canada recorded a pretax special item of $11 million related to employee and overhead reductions. We expect there will be some incremental charges of less than $10 million related to these efforts that will be recorded in the third and fourth quarters.
Our ongoing EBITDA increased year-over-year, so let's turn to those results, which really tell the story of the strength and resilience of our business model.
As noted, we delivered very strong second quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $652 million at Spectra Energy and $456 million at Spectra Energy Partners. Given the current macro environment, it is significant that Spectra Energy's ongoing EBITDA increase 4% quarter-over-quarter. As we've consistently demonstrated year after year, our portfolio of asset is structured to moderate the effect of various business cycles and maximize the upside benefits. And with approximately 95% fee base earnings at U.S. Transmission that have no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations, SEP is a standout in the MLP space.
So let's take a look at the drivers of our results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, whose EBITDA was up almost 30%. SEP is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses and is shown on the upper right hand corner of Slide 4. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $396 million, up $76 million. That is almost 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Results for the 2015 quarter were driven primarily by increased earnings from expansion projects placed into service, specifically, TEAM 2014, TEAM South and the Kingsport project.
Our Liquids business reported second quarter EBITDA of $78 million compared with $51 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and tariffs on the Express crude pipeline, as well as higher equity earnings from increased volumes on the Sand Hills natural gas liquids pipeline. As you can see, SEP is performing very well and delivering results ahead of our expectations.
Moving to the table on the left-hand side of this slide, distribution reported second quarter EBITDA of $98 million compared to $512 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due almost entirely to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was down 13% this quarter compared with 2014.
Western Canada recorded ongoing EBITDA for the quarter of $115 million compared to $111 million last year. Higher earnings in Empress offset the effects of the lower Canadian dollar.
With respect to FX, the 13% reduction in the Canadian dollar affected EBITDA for both our Canadian business segments by $26 million quarter-over-quarter. Fortunately, about 2/3 of that number is naturally hedged on a net income basis, so the change in net income related to FX was only $6 million.
A number of you have expressed interest in how the current operating environment in Western Canada might affect our business risk going forward. So I want to take a moment and speak to the business model of that segment. First, 95% of our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. While the Canadian pipeline model is similar to the model used in the U.S., it's important to remember that the Western Canadian G&P structure is different from the more commodity-sensitive model that largely exist across the U.S., GNP business.
Second, as you're aware, we implemented a risk management program at our Empress processing facility to reduce cash flow volume. At our February Analyst Day, we said that we expect at Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash this year, and we're on track to exceed that forecast for 2015 given the hedges we put in place.
Looking forward to 2016, we've hedged about half of our targeted sales levels at positive margins, and we will continue to opportunistically layer in hedges to see year progresses.
It's also important to note that nearly all of our Empress propane and butane sales contracts and our hedging program are linked to Conway and Mont Belvieu pricing, not Edmonton.
Moving on to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing EBITDA was a negative $27 million in the quarter compared with $54[ph] million last year. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices, which are down about 50% from last year's levels. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings growth or increased earnings from asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and savings from other strategic initiatives.
While we all love to see stronger commodity prices and positive earnings at DCP, I would remind you of the counterintuitively effect DCP's lower earnings have on Spectra Energy's cash flows. Since distributions from DCP can't drop below 0, it's negative earnings benefit our DCF by ultimately lowering our cash taxes. So overall, Spectra Energy's ongoing EBITDA was up quarter-over-quarter despite both lower commodity prices and lower Canadian currency. And again the result of SEP reflect its significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure.
Importantly, these results exceeded our budget expectations for the 2015 quarter.
Let's take a look at our DCF's scheduled beginning with SEP as shown on Slide 5. SEP's standalone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, $82 million more than the same quarter last year with distribution coverage of 1.3x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to the higher EBITDA I just described.
For the full year, we expect SEP's coverage to be at least 1.1x consistent with our 2015 forecast.
SEP general partner and the limited partner distributions still Spectra Energy for the quarter of $56 million and $145 million, respectively. And earlier this morning, SEP announced its 31st consecutive quarterly distribution increase of $0.0125 per unit. We continue to see strong interest in our ATM program at SEP. To this point in the year, SEP has raised almost $350 million through this vehicle.
Given the attractiveness of SEP's investor value proposition and the lack of commodity and volume exposure, we expect continued utilization at the ATM program throughout the year and can further expand the program if needed.
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow as shown on Slide 6. At Spectra Energy, distributable cash flow is $274 million for the quarter in line with last year. Coverage is 1.1x and DCF per share was $0.41. Year-to-date, we're at 1.7x coverage and by the end of the year, we expect coverage to be at least 1.2x, consistent with the forecast we provided at the beginning of the year.
Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of June 30. So while we still have a little less than half a year to go, we're feeling very good about how the business is continuing to perform. We're ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point in time in terms of EBITDA and DCF despite the current environment.
We're very pleased with our performance today and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you just heard, the results we delivered this quarter underscore the stability of our overall earnings and cash-generation capabilities. I think that stability comes from a well-positioned, high performing portfolio of assets that allows us to generate value creating DCF regardless of commodity or market fluctuations. And it also reinforces our confidence and our ability to deliver ongoing annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share while maintaining coverage at/or above 1. Pat mentioned that we realized strong results for the quarter at both Spectra Energy and SEP. That significant and worth repeating, we believe the strength of our businesses and financial structure important differentiators allowing us to deliver consistent and dependable growth.
With everything that's occurring in the energy space, I want to take a minute to share our priorities for driving growth and increasing shareholder returns for both Spectra Energy and SEP investors. It goes without saying that safe, reliable operations are our assets is a big element of Spectra Energy success, and so we are steadfastly focused on day-to-day operations. That focus ensures that our customers' requirements are met in a safe and responsible manner. And my confidence on our operating team's ability gives me more time to concentrate on 4 other major areas. First, ensuring that we successfully execute on the secured project backlog that we already have and that we do so on time and on budget. Our execution advantage really does differentiate us, especially when you consider that most projects take several years to come into service given the current regulatory process. As you can imagine, this is no small undertaking, but we continue to deliver. This year, we've already put $600 million[ph] of expansion capital into service and this amount will grow to more than $2 billion by year end.
Second, I'm focused on securing contracts for projects that are in development. While our track record was just for successful and signing of the majority of projects we pursue, it's not possible to secure all of them. With that said, we continue to expect that we will secure contracts of at least another $20 billion of attractive returns by the end of the decade. To date, this year alone, we've moved more than $1 billion of projects in the execution and we expect to add to that by year end.
Third, with our partner, Phillip 66, we continue to focus on the appropriate structure of DCP to ensure that DCP and DPM are set up in a manner that provides the best opportunity for owners to realize their value. As we said before, we expect this matter will be resolved in the October timeframe as we work our way through the process, our objective remains as restructuring outcomes that allows DCP's enterprise to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing. It positions DCP to efficiently to finance that growth.
Lastly, I'm watching for industry consolidation opportunities that fit our portfolio strategically and add value to our shareholders. Our current Drive to 35 backlog does not contemplate any M&A activity. But as we've mentioned before, we're constantly looking at opportunities to complement our business portfolio and profile and advance our value creation objectives.
So with that, let me now turn to our projects and execution. As you've heard Pat mentioned, Spectra Energy and SEP's second quarter results benefited from new assets we successfully put in the ground last year. But we have also had 2 projects that moved into service since our last earnings call totaling about $600 million, so let me begin with those.
At U.S. Transmission, the Union Gas to Gas City project, service well ahead of its original November 1 in-service date, and DCP placed the Lucerne II processing plant in the DJ Basin into service since our last call along with several smaller gathering projects. We also have about $1.6 billion in projects that are nearing completion and are on track to go into service later this year. Our OPEN Project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to Southern markets beginning in November, not sooner; our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project is scheduled to go into service at Union Gas during the fourth quarter; DCP's on the final stages of starting up its CO2 processing plant in the Permian; and another Liquids segment, the Red Lake lateral to expand the rich Sand Hills to access growing Permian production will go fully into service once the CO2 comps online. Placing projects into service on time or even ahead of schedule is an example of how we've built our track record of delivering on our execution promises, an advantage for both customers and, of course, investors.
We've got a full complement of great projects and execution, which are detailed on this slide. I'll start by highlighting 3 new projects that we recently moved into execution. You recall that during last quarter, we mentioned OPEN season that were underway for projects that we would further critic Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Since then, we moved our 11 on extension project in execution. We've secured commercial commitments for the project and are proceeding with the FERC approval process, an anticipated 2017 in-service date.
We also moved the High Pine project in the execution. High Pine is another project in Western Canada that will further expand the BC Pipeline. You'll recall that we announced the binding OPEN season for this project during our last earnings call, and we were able to quickly execute our commercial agreement to move the project forward. This $325 million project with have a late 2016 in-service date.
Another project we moved into execution this past quarter is the 2017 Dawn-Parkway project at Union Gas. Commercial contracts underpinning the $620 million project have been executed, application has been filed for approval with Ontario Energy Board. Other projects in execution are also proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. All of these projects underpinned by executed customer agreements that are unaffected by commodity market conditions. In fact you'll note that about 75% of our extension CapEx is driven by natural gas demand pull projects rather than supply-push.
During the quarter, both the AIM and 2016 Dawn-Parkway projects began construction and are on track to be in-service in the second half of 2016.
NEXUS is on track for its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. We completed a major milestone and a regulatory process for this project by submitting our FERC resource reports in June and we anticipate filing a form of FERC application later this year.
Our execution efforts also continue on 2 projects in Western Canada to expand our BC Pipeline, the Jackfish Lake and REM projects. We expect both of these pipe and expansions to go into service during 2017. As you know, LNG projects on the West Coast of Canada and the U.S. have been delayed given current market dynamics, however, producers don't need to move natural gas. So this LNG deferment has led to these new opportunities for us in our Western Canadian pipeline, totaling about $1 billion already this year.
The pipeline expansion opportunities we're seeing in British Columbia underscore the benefit of having an expensive and strategic existing footprint in our region. At a time when the Montney region producers are looking for the lowest cost option to move their product quickly to the Pacific Northwest or Eastern Canada or Alberta markets, having a steel in the ground already is clearly a competitive advantage for us.
So wrapping up the review of projects in execution, we will have more than $2 billion of projects into service by year end, creating additional earnings and cash flow for 2016 and beyond. We are making great progress on all of our projects and execution, and we continue to further expand our execution backlog by adding about $1 billion of projects over justice last quarter.
You've seen on our impressive slate of projects in-service and execution projects, projects that will deliver the earnings and cash flow we laid out  to you in our 3-year plan for you in January and February. In addition to our backlog of projects and execution, we have a healthy portfolio of opportunities in development that will lead to continued growth and we're working diligently to move those projects forward.
Let me take a look at some of our projects that are in development. Access Northeast underdevelopment with Eversource and National Grid, continues to advance quite nicely. Unlike other projects in the region, which are intended to serve gas LDCs in England, Access Northeast will serve the electric power market. Project customers, including Eversource, National Grid and Central Maine Power, serve more than 80% of the 6.5 million electric customers in the region. The project will expand the Algonquin and Maritime systems utilizing their existing footprints. We expect the customers to field agreements with their respective PUC soon and anticipate moving Access Northeast and execution later this year or early 2016 once state regulatory approvals have been received by our customers.
An interesting note for you, we've already seen a record summertime demand from power generators on our existing Algonquin and Texas Eastern lines of this year, with new #1 delivery days of more than 800 million cubic feet a day on each of these lines and daily average deliveries to power generators of 21% over '14 on Algonquin and up 33% over 2014 on the East End markets on [indiscernible].
Also underdevelopment are 2 Marcellus and Utica expansion projects, the Greater Philadelphia Expansion and Marcellus market projects, which received positive responses to OPEN seasons during the quarter and discussions with potential customers are underway.
Moving to Western Canada, we kicked off another binding OPEN season in late July to further expand the north section of the BC Pipeline and we expect the results from that this fall. As I mentioned earlier, we're extremely pleased with the level of producer interest we're seeing for our BC Pipeline and we are exploring ways to further serve our producers in the Montney region.
Customer interest also remain strong in our larger scale crude oil projects in development. While we continue to expect a late in-the-decade timeframe to secure commitments to advance these projects, in the interim, we'll seek smaller scale optimization project similar to the $135 million Express Enhancement project currently in execution.
To summarize, we made significant progress during the quarter on our Drive to 35. In fact, we're more than halfway to our goal with $8.2 billion in service now and $9.6 billion in execution as I speak. We continue to advance our projects in execution and development to generate incremental cash flow and, of course, shareholder value.
As you've heard today, Spectra Energy delivered solid results for the quarter. We're disappointed, of course, that our stock price isn't reflecting the strong performance of our businesses, we are not alone. The energy sector is being painted with a far too broad brush and suffering the consequences of perceptions energy cash flows are correlated to commodity prices. That's just not the case, of course, and certainly not the case or Spectra Energy an SEP. The current environment allows investors to differentiate between investment options. So let me take a minute to remind you why Spectra Energy and SEP are best-in-class investment opportunities.
We understand what investors are looking for and Spectra Energy and SEP offer all those attributes. Specifically, we know that investors prefer strong portfolios. Our unrivaled footprint connects all the major North American supply basins with growing demand markets. It could not replicate our geographic positioning, nor reach today. Our healthy mix of businesses are structured to minimize the effect of multiple and varied market cycles.
Next we know that stable reliable cash flows are important for investors as well. As we told you back in February, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for the 2015 to 2017 period will come from our fee-based business, and our DCF forecast is virtually unexposed to incremental commodity downside. And SEP is fairly unique in the MLP space, as 95% of U.S. Transmission revenues, the largest component of SEP and Spectra Energy for that matter, is reservation based with no commodity, nor volume exposure. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years, and the Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, thanks to the contract restructuring we've done since acquiring this system in 2013.
Investors see companies with robust growth profile and again we're making great progress on our Drive to 35. By 2020, we'll grow our EBITDA by about $1 billion and approximately $800 million at Spectra Energy and SEP, respectively. The projects that we have in execution are moved into service and begin generating cash. And with the ongoing growth and the demand for natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, we have tremendous confidence in realizing our projects in development.
Healthy financials are also important and we have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our growth projects and pursuing new opportunities. We have 2 solid currencies, strong investment grade balance sheet and disciplined financial management. Investors look for strong track record and proven performance and you've heard me talk about our execution advantage, unlike another feature that sets us apart. Since 2007, we've delivered more than 70 projects into service for capital expansion investment of about $9 billion, a record that speaks to our level of about ability and achievement.
Lastly and most importantly, investors want attractive returns. Spectra Energy has done that in the past 5 years, our annual dividend per share has grown from $1 to $1.48, and we're committed to continuing to grow Spectra Energy's dividend by at least $0.14 per share through 2017.
Similarly, SEP has delivered 31 consecutive quarters of distribution growth and we're committed to continuing that track record with an 8% to 9% annual growth rate through 2017.
So those are the attributes that differentiate Spectra Energy and SEP from other energy companies, and why we believe so strongly that both entities offer a best-in-class investment opportunity today.
With that, let me turn things over to Julie to take your questions on the quarter."

And I think that you're going to have ebb and flows between GNP and from pipelines, but investors in the E&P business are going to be happy that the producers how pipelines that can take gas down to the Pacific Northwest and Alberta. So a lot of solutions being worked on, but I don't see huge NGL solution in the near term in Western Canada."

Or is there some sort of demand payment that also needs to get paid, as the contracts for a certain number of years so is there a recontracting risk, some detail about that would be helpful."

You should think about it very much like negotiated pipeline rights in the United States. So we signed up contracts, 4 processing plants, long-term contracts and like the Dawson project that we put in place a couple of years was a 20-year contract with a set fee that it's not volume risk, in other words, unlike you often see GNP in the United States not volume risk. Now at the end of contract life, just like on a pipeline in the United States or Canada, you are exposed to recontacting. So that's obviously, something you're always looking at. But I think, our average contract life would be 3 to 5 years for the overall portfolio. As I said projects like Dawson, more like 20 years. So think of it that much more like a negotiated rate pipeline as opposed to just cost of service."

The first on the 2 Appalachian expansion projects that you discussed. Just given the recent shift in basin dynamics and not only being imbalanced between supply growth and demand, but a lot of the pipe options out of the region and the impact on regional pricing differentials may be shifting economics or at least net back incentives. I'm just wondering if anything has changed from customers on processing your perspective, maybe a better way to ask the question is, if you could kind of quantify or give us some color on what positive response to the OPEN season means. And then secondly, the 1 project that wasn't discuss was that Texas-Eastern Lebanon expansion project, and I was just wondering in terms of incremental CapEx to scale that project up, if there could be any opportunity for that."

And so you've seen us a put a variety of idea projects that not only might take gas, molecules a long distance, but actually to the next closest liquid point. So you will see the projects ebb and flow in terms of their size. I don't think there's anything, I mean, restricting customers from signing up. Sure, E&P customers are very focused on their cap spend and were they think commodity prices will go. But I think, the Lebanon project, as you'll see on 1 of the slides that we put out of the $9 billion, we did put it into execution this quarter, Darren. And I would say, it's lumped in with the Access South and there in Adair Southwest expansion because they really are, in many respects, for some different customers, achieving similar type goals. So even in the way we're going to FERC and have those approved, we have lumped in as 1 project. So you can continue to see projects morph. I think the underlying facet that's really critical and a real advantage for Spectra, we already have assets in the ground and we're going to -- and I hear a lot of discussion about reversing flows and stuff, please, guys, we've been doing that for a number of years now. So I know other folks are starting to think and get to that. That's not novel for Spectra and our customers so I think that's why you're seeing some of the results that you are seeing.

I don't think there's that time they want to keep the lights on. And I think the Eversources, the National Grids to the world, which represent, what's, $5.5 million of 6.5 million customers out there, Bill, I think they recognize. So I don't see changes there. I would also say that doesn't take away form any other projects that are also needed out there. Remember, our AIM, our Atlantic Bridge projects are about LDCs, that's already in execution, well in execution. The other projects about -- the Access Northeast is about electric. Other folks major projects being pitched are LDC-related projects. So I think the dynamics don't allow for changes. I think, the dynamics that we're seeing more like additional projects that will be coming forth over the following year. So if you think we've got 16, 17, 18 projects coming into service, if you look at gas demand in North America going from 75 Bcf a day to the 100 Bcf, 110 Bcf a day in the next 10 years, despite what any brilliant policy may be coming out of government officials, that will happen. And those what's going to happen in the Northeast and that's advantage pipeline, that's got to happen unless people are willing to let lights go out, get cold.

Whether you think a 6- to 10-year solution is a long-term or not, but I think you're talking about of while before those projects kick in. And remember, as demand grows across North America, the Pacific Northwest, Alberta production is often -- has been declining, so Western Canada is not a single market. And you're still seeing activity going on from demand perspective in the oil sands of which much of the fuel they need to use is natural gas. So yes, I mean, there's no doubt the opportunity has been created by LNG deferment. But the amount of grass we're talking about is nowhere near the amount of gas that would be needed for LNG.

The issue is what you would do it from a long-term perspective. I'll give you a good example, it really isn't commodity, but sometimes you do think that maybe it's not the perfect fit but turn out to be quite well. When we bought West Coast, Union Gas, which is still in our portfolio and we have well in excess of a couple of billion dollars of expansion projects for utility we would expect on pipeline, that may not fit perfectly but it's a good generator. Meanwhile, other utilities that we held when we bought West Coast, we have sold those assets.

As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered very strong ongoing EBITDA for the quarter. But before I get into the details of those",1354,"Thank you and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered very strong ongoing EBITDA for the quarter. But before I get into the details of those results, I want to discuss some special items we recorded during the quarter as shown on Slide 3.
There were 3 special items which lowered reported EBITDA by $217 million or $0.20 per share. As you can see on this slide, only 1 of these items affected DCF by $11 million. The first item is $194 million pretax, noncash charge or $122 million after-tax, which represents our 50% share of a goodwill impairment at DCP. The second item also is associated with DCP and is a pretax, noncash charge of $12 million related to our share of a loss on the sale of an asset during the quarter. Lastly, Western Canada recorded a pretax special item of $11 million related to employee and overhead reductions. We expect there will be some incremental charges of less than $10 million related to these efforts that will be recorded in the third and fourth quarters.
Our ongoing EBITDA increased year-over-year, so let's turn to those results, which really tell the story of the strength and resilience of our business model. As noted, we delivered very strong second quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $652 million at Spectra Energy and $456 million at Spectra Energy Partners. Given the current macro environment, it is significant that Spectra Energy's ongoing EBITDA increase 4% quarter-over-quarter. 
As we've consistently demonstrated year after year, our portfolio of asset is structured to moderate the effect of various business cycles and maximize the upside benefits. And with approximately 95% fee base earnings at U.S. Transmission that have no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations, SEP is a standout in the MLP space. 
So let's take a look at the drivers of our results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, whose EBITDA was up almost 30%. SEP is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses and is shown on the upper right hand corner of Slide 4. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $396 million, up $76 million. That is almost 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Results for the 2015 quarter were driven primarily by increased earnings from expansion projects placed into service, specifically, TEAM 2014, TEAM South and the Kingsport project.
Our Liquids business reported second quarter EBITDA of $78 million compared with $51 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and tariff on the Express crude pipeline, as well as higher equity earnings from the increased volumes on the Sand Hills natural gas liquids pipeline. As you can see, SEP is performing very well and delivering results ahead of our expectations.
Moving to the table on the left-hand side of this slide, distribution reported second quarter EBITDA of $98 million compared to $112 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due almost entirely to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was down 13% this quarter compared with 2014.
Western Canada recorded ongoing EBITDA for the quarter of $115 million compared to $111 million last year. Higher earnings in Empress offset the effects of the lower Canadian dollar.
With respect to FX, the 13% reduction in the Canadian dollar affected EBITDA for both our Canadian business segments by $26 million quarter-over-quarter. Fortunately, about 2/3 of that number is naturally hedged on a net income basis, so the change in net income related to FX was only $6 million.
Now, a number of you have expressed interest in how the current operating environment in Western Canada might affect our business risk going forward. So I want to take a moment and speak to the business model of that segment. 
First, 95% of our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. While the Canadian pipeline model is similar to the model used in the U.S., it's important to remember that the Western Canadian G&P structure is different from the more commodity-sensitive model that largely exist across the U.S., GNP business.
Second, as you're aware, we implemented a risk management program at our Empress processing facility to reduce cash flow volume. At our February Analyst Day, we said that we expect that Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash this year, and we're on track to exceed that forecast for 2015 given the hedges we put in place.
Looking forward to 2016, we've hedged about half of our targeted sales levels at positive margins, and we will continue to opportunistically layer in hedges to see year progresses. It's also important to note that nearly all of our Empress propane and butane sales contracts and our hedging program are linked to Conway and Mont Belvieu pricing, not Edmonton.
Moving on to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing EBITDA was a negative $27 million in the quarter compared with $54 million last year. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices, which are down about 50% from last year's levels. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings growth or increased earnings from asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and savings from other strategic initiatives.
While we all love to see stronger commodity prices and positive earnings at DCP, I would remind you of the counterintuitively effect DCP's lower earnings have on Spectra Energy's cash flows. Since distributions from DCP can't drop below 0, it's negative earnings benefit our DCF by ultimately lowering our cash taxes. 
So overall, Spectra Energy's ongoing EBITDA was up quarter-over-quarter despite both lower commodity prices and the lower Canadian currency. And again the results at SEP reflect its significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure.
Importantly, these results exceeded our budget expectations for the 2015 quarter. Let's take a look at our DCF's scheduled beginning with SEP as shown on Slide 5. SEP's standalone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, $82 million more than the same quarter last year with distribution coverage of 1.3x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to the higher EBITDA I just described. For the full year, we expect SEP's coverage to be at least 1.1x consistent with our 2015 forecast.
SEP paid general partner and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $56 million and $145 million, respectively. And earlier this morning, SEP announced its 31st consecutive quarterly distribution increase of $0.0125 per unit. We continue to see strong interest in our ATM program at SEP. To this point in the year, SEP has raised almost $350 million through this vehicle. Given the attractiveness of SEP's investor value proposition and the lack of commodity and volume exposure, we expect continued utilization at the ATM program throughout the year and can further expand the program if needed.
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow as shown on Slide 6. At Spectra Energy, distributable cash flow is $274 million for the quarter in line with last year. Coverage is 1.1x and DCF per share was $0.41. Year-to-date, we're at 1.7x coverage and by the end of the year, we expect coverage to be at least 1.2x, consistent with the forecast we provided at the beginning of the year.
Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of June 30. So while we still have a little less than half a year to go, we're feeling very good about how the business has continued to perform. We're ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point in time in terms of EBITDA and DCF despite the current environment. We're very pleased with our performance today and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."
610501,306267434,849781,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks very much, Pat, and good morning everybody.

As you just heard, the results we delivered this quarter underscore the stability of our overall earnings and cash-generation capabilities. I think that stability comes from a well-positioned, high-performing portfolio of assets that allows us to generate value creating DCF regardless of commodity or market fluctuations. It also reinforces our confidence and our ability to deliver ongoing annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share while maintaining coverage at/or above 1. Pat mentioned that we realized strong results for the quarter at both Spectra Energy and SEP, that's significant and worth repeating. We believe the strength of our businesses and financial structure are important differentiators allowing us to deliver consistent and dependable growth.
With everything that's occurring in the energy space, I want to take a minute to share our priorities for driving growth and increasing shareholder returns for both Spectra Energy and SEP investors. It goes without saying that safe, reliable operations on our assets is a big element of Spectra Energy's success, and so we are steadfastly focused on day-to-day operations. That focus ensures that our customers' requirements are met in a safe and responsible manner. And my confidence on our operating team's abilities gives me more time to concentrate on 4 other major areas. 
First, ensuring that we successfully execute on the secured project backlog that we already have and that we do so on time and on budget. Our execution advantage really does differentiate us, especially when you consider that most projects take several years to come into service given the current regulatory process. As you can imagine, this is no small undertaking, but we continue to deliver. This year, we've already put $600 billion of expansion capital in the service and this amount will grow to more than $2 billion by year end.
Second, I'm focused on securing contracts for projects that are in development. While our track record would suggest we're successful on signing up the majority of projects we pursue, we know it's not possible to secure all of them. With that said, we continue to expect that we will secure contracts of at least another $20 billion at attractive returns by the end of the decade. To date, this year alone, we've moved more than $1 billion of projects in the execution and we expect to add to that in a meaningful way by year end.
Third, with our partner, Phillip 66, we continue to focus on the appropriate structure of DCP to ensure that DCP and DPM are set up in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the owners to realize their value. As we said before, we expect this matter will be resolved in the October timeframe as we work our way through the process, our ultimate objective remains ensuring that any structuring outcomes still allows DCP's enterprise to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing. That it positions DCP to efficiently finance that growth.
Lastly, I'm watching for industry consolidation opportunities that fit our portfolio strategically and add value to our shareholders. Our current Drive to 35 backlog does not contemplate any M&A activity. But as we've mentioned before, we're constantly looking at opportunities to complement our business portfolio and profile and advance our value of creation objectives.
So with that, let me now turn to our projects and execution. As you've heard Pat mentioned, Spectra Energy and SEP's second quarter results benefited from new assets we successfully put in the ground last year. But we have also had 2 projects that moved into service since our last earnings call totaling about $600 million, so let me begin with those.
At U.S. Transmission, the Union Gas -- the Uniontown Gas to Gas City project commence service well ahead of its original November 1 in-service date, and DCP placed the Lucerne II processing plant in the DJ Basin into service since our last call along with several smaller gathering projects. We also have about $1.6 billion in projects that are nearing completion and are on track to go into service later this year. 
Our OPEN Project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to Southern markets beginning in November, if not sooner. Our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project is scheduled to go into service at Union Gas during the fourth quarter. DCP's on the final stages of starting up its CO2 processing plant in the Permian. And at our Liquids segment, the Red Lake lateral to expand the reach of Sand Hills to access growing Permian production, will go fully into service once CO2 comes online. 
Placing projects into service on time or even ahead of schedule is an example of how we've built our track record of delivering on our execution promises, an advantage for both customers and, of course, investors. We've got a full complement of great projects and execution, which are detailed on this slide. I'll start by highlighting 3 new projects that we recently moved into execution. You recall that during last quarter, we mentioned OPEN seasons that were underway for projects that would further connect Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Since then, we moved our 11 on extension project and execution. We've secured commercial commitments for the project and are proceeding with the FERC approval process and anticipated 2017 in-service date.
We also moved the High Pine project in the execution. High Pine is another project in Western Canada that will further expand the BC Pipeline. You'll recall that we announced the binding OPEN season for this project during our last earnings call, and we were able to quickly execute our commercial agreement to move the project forward. This $325 million project with have a late 2016 in-service date.
Another project we moved into execution this past quarter is the 2017 Dawn-Parkway project at Union Gas. Commercial contracts underpinning this $620 million project have been executed, facility's application has been filed for approval with the Ontario Energy Board. 
Other projects in execution are also proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. All of these projects are underpinned by executed customer agreements that are unaffected by commodity market conditions. In fact you'll note that about 75% of our expansion CapEx is driven by natural gas demand pull projects rather than supply-push.
During the quarter, both the AIM and 2016 Dawn-Parkway projects began construction and are on track to be in-service in the second half of 2016.  NEXUS is on track for its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. We completed a major milestone and a regulatory process for this project by submitting our FERC resource reports in June and we anticipate filing a form of FERC application later this year.
Our execution efforts also continue on 2 projects in Western Canada to expand our BC Pipeline, the Jackfish Lake and RAM projects. We expect both of these pipeline expansions to go into service during 2017. As you know, LNG projects on the West Coast of Canada and the U.S. have been delayed given current market dynamics. However, producers don't need to move natural gas. So this LNG deferment has led to these new opportunities for us in our Western Canadian pipeline, totaling about $1 billion already this year.
The pipeline expansion opportunities we're seeing in British Columbia underscore the benefit of having an expensive and strategic existing footprint in our region. At a time when the Montney region producers are looking for the lowest cost option to move their product quickly to the Pacific Northwest or Eastern Canada or Alberta markets, having steel in the ground already is clearly a competitive advantage for us.
So wrapping up the review of projects in execution, we would have brought more than $2 billion of projects into service by year end, creating additional earnings and cash flow for 2016 and beyond. We're making great progress on all of our projects and execution, and we continue to further expand our execution backlog by adding about $1 billion of projects over just this last quarter.
You've seen our impressive slate of projects in-service and in execution, projects that would deliver the earnings in cash flow we laid in our our 3-year plan for you in January, February. In addition to our backlog of projects and execution, we have a healthy portfolio of opportunities in development that will lead to continued growth and we're working diligently to move those projects forward.
Let me take a look at some of our projects that are in development. Access Northeast underdevelopment with Eversource and National Grid, continues to advance quite nicely. Unlike other projects in the region, which are intended to serve gas LDCs in New England, Access Northeast will serve the electric power market. Project customers, including Eversource, National Grid and Central Maine Power, serve more than 80% of the 6.5 million electric customers in the region. The project will expand the Algonquin and Maritime systems utilizing their existing footprints. We expect the customers to file agreements with their respective PUC soon and we anticipate moving Access Northeast and the execution later this year or early 2016 once state regulatory approvals have been received by our customers.
An interesting note for you, we've already seen a record summertime demand from power generators on our existing Algonquin and Texas Eastern lines this year, with new #1 delivery days of more than 800 million cubic feet a day on each of these lines and daily average deliveries to power generators up 21% over '14 on Algonquin and up 33% over 2014 on the east end markets on 3 at TETCO. Also underdevelopment are 2 Marcellus and Utica expansion projects, the Greater Philadelphia Expansion and Marcellus to Market projects, which received positive responses to OPEN seasons during the quarter and discussions with potential customers are underway.
Moving to Western Canada, we kicked off another binding OPEN season in late July to further expand the T-North section of the BC Pipeline and we expect the results from that this fall. As I mentioned earlier, we're extremely pleased with the level of producer interest we're seeing for our BC Pipeline and we're exploring ways to further serve producers in the Montney region.
Customer interest also remains strong on our large scale crude oil projects in development. While we continue to expect a late in-the-decade timeframe to secure commitments to advance these projects, in the interim, we'll seek smaller scale optimization project similar to the $135 million Express Enhancement project currently in execution.
To summarize, we made significant progress during the quarter on our Drive to 35. In fact, we're more than halfway to our goal with $8.2 billion in service now and $9.6 billion in execution as I speak. We continue to advance our projects in execution and development to generate incremental cash flow and, of course, shareholder value.
As you've heard today, Spectra Energy delivered solid results for the quarter. We're disappointed, of course, that our stock price isn't reflecting the strong performance of our businesses. We're not alone. The energy sector is being painted with a far too broad brush and suffering the consequences of perceptions that all energy cash flows are correlated to commodity prices. That's just not the case, of course, and certainly not the case for Spectra Energy and SEP. The current environment allows investors to differentiate between investment options. So let me take a minute to remind you why Spectra Energy and SEP are best-in-class investment opportunities.
We understand what investors are looking for and Spectra Energy and SEP offer all those attributes. Specifically, we know that investors prefer strong portfolios. Our unrivaled footprint connects all the major North American supply basins with growing demand markets. It could not replicate our geographic positioning, nor reach today. Our healthy mix of businesses are structured to minimize the effect of multiple and varied market cycles.
Next we know that stable, reliable cash flows are important for investors as well. As we told you back in February, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for the 2015 to 2017 period will come from our fee-based business, and our DCF forecast is virtually unexposed to incremental commodity downside. And SEP is fairly unique in the MLP space, as 95% of U.S. Transmission revenues, the largest component of SEP and Spectra Energy for that matter, is reservation based with no commodity nor volume exposure. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years. And the Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, thanks to the contract restructuring we've done since acquiring this system in 2013.
Investors see companies with robust growth profiles and again, we're making great progress on our Drive to 35. By 2020, we'll grow our EBITDA by about $1 billion and approximately $800 million at Spectra Energy and SEP, respectively. That the projects that we have in execution are moved into service and begin generating cash. And with the ongoing growth and the demand for natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, we have tremendous confidence in realizing our projects in development.
Healthy financials are also important and we have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our growth projects and pursue new opportunity. We have 2 solid currencies, strong investment grade balance sheet and disciplined financial management. Investors look for strong track record and proven performance and you've heard me talk about our execution advantage, unlike another feature that sets us apart. Since 2007, we've delivered more than 70 projects into service for capital expansion investment of about $9 billion, a record that speaks to our level of accountability and achievement.
Lastly and most importantly, investors want attractive returns and Spectra Energy has done that. In the past 5 years, our annual dividend per share has grown from $1 to $1.48, and we're committed to continuing to grow Spectra Energy's dividend by at least $0.14 per share through 2017. Similarly, SEP has delivered 31 consecutive quarters of distribution growth and we're committed to continuing that track record with an 8% to 9% annual growth rate through 2017.
So those are the attributes that differentiate Spectra Energy and SEP from other energy companies, and why we believe so strongly that both entities offer a best-in-class investment opportunity today.
With that, let me turn things over to Julie to take your questions on the quarter."

That being said, I think June had the highest production out of Western Canada in a very long time, I think, 13 or 14 Bcf. And while you're right, you're seeing rig counts come off, you are still seeing a lot of gas being produced. And I think you see that affect hitting our pipeline business, which is, as you know, is a very long-term fee-based contract perspective. And I'm not sure many people would have predicted that Spectra Energy would added $1 billion in pipeline projects this year into our backlog out of Western Canada. And I think that you're going to have ebb and flows between GNP and from pipelines, but investors in the E&P business are going to be happy that the producers have pipelines that can take gas down to the Pacific Northwest and Alberta. So a lot of solutions being worked out, but I don't see huge NGL solution in the near term in Western Canada."

Now at the end of contract life, just like on a pipeline in the United States or Canada, you are exposed to recontacting. So that's obviously, that's something you're always looking at. But I think, our average contract life would be 3 to 5 years for the overall whole portfolio and as I said projects like Dawson, more like 20 years.

Maybe a better way to ask the question is, if you could kind of quantify or give us some color on what a positive response to the OPEN season means.

So you will see the projects ebb and flow in terms of their size. I don't think there's anything, I mean, restricting customers from signing up. Sure, E&P customers are very focused on their cap spend and were they think commodity prices will go. But -- and I think, the Lebanon project, as you'll see on one of the slides that we put out of the $9 billion, we did put it into execution this quarter, Darren. And I would say, it's lumped in with the Access South and Adair Southwest expansion because they really are, in many respects for some different customers, achieving similar-type goals. So even in the way we're going to FERC and have those approved, we have lumped in as one project. So you continue to see projects morph. I think the underlying facet that's really critical and a real advantage for Spectra, we already have assets in the ground so we're going to -- and I hear a lot of discussion about reversing flows and stuff. Please, guys, we've been doing that for a number of years now. So I know other folks are starting to think and get to that.

I mean, as I noted, just volume increase we're seeing in terms of our deliveries to generators. I think -- and remember, this is summer where the challenge is really in the winter and we're already seeing 20%, 30% increases out there. I don't think there's that time if they want to keep the lights on. And I think the Eversources, the National Grids to the world, which represent, what's, 5.5 million of 6.5 million customers up there bill, I think they recognize. So I don't see big changes there. I would also say that doesn't take away from any other projects that are also needed out there. Remember, our AIM, our Atlantic Bridge projects are about LDCs, that's already in execution, well in execution. The other projects about -- the Access Northeast is about electric. Other folks, major projects being pitched, are LDC-related projects. So I think the dynamics don't allow for changes. I think, the dynamics that we're seeing more like additional projects that will be coming forth over the following year. So if you think that we've got, we have 16, 17, 18 projects coming into service. If you look at gas demand in North America going from 75 call it Bcf a day to the 100 Bcf, 110 Bcf a day in the next 10 years, despite what any brilliant policy might be coming out of various government officials, that will happen. And those -- most of that's going to happen in the Northeast and that's advantage pipeline. That's got to happen unless people are willing to let lights go out, get cold or at this time, you're going to get a hot stick in the Northeast."

On OPEN, obviously, our time frame is still the 1st of November, and I'm hopeful that we'll be able to do that early as well. Obviously, everyday, we can get that pipe in earlier that has benefits from a safety perspective, from an operational perspective and obviously, from an economic perspective in many cases, not always the contracts to ramp up early. But I will tell you, the customers that have got the projects, they like it coming in early back to the point I was making that anytime we can get their project the heck away from supplier into demand area, they'll take it all day long. So we're pushing as hard as we can. We obviously, have the very systematic approach to doing projects this is not a new area for us.

Look, I will be surprised to see any LNG in the West Coast of North America definitely not going to happen before 2020 at this point in time, even if you saw approvals happen instantly, just the amount of work that actually gets done. So whether you think a 6- to 10-year solution is long-term or not, but I think you're talking about a while before those projects kick in. And remember, as demand grows across North America, the Pacific Northwest, Alberta production is often -- has been declining, so Western Canada is not a single market. And you're still seeing activity going on from a demand perspective in the oil sands of which much of the fuel they need to use is natural gas. So yes, I mean, there's no doubt the opportunity has been created by LNG deferment. But the amount of gas we're talking about is nowhere near the amount of gas that would be needed for LNG. So one is not going to replace the other, the LNG would just be incremental to that."

So rough numbers that makes your coverage 20% above your dividend, so call it 1.2 range. And so, it's obviously, out of everything folks are looking at, that's probably the one that's on pretty good momentum. I don't have control over that, but I think the reality is that infrastructure builds in this country are critical and I think Congress, on a bipartisan basis, obviously, recognizes that and sees the benefit that have been out there.

So obviously, we would -- we're very focused on anything we do to be largely in the vast majority fee-based, depending on asset that we might buy, if it had some small elements, which may not stand the portfolio from a long-term perspective of commodity, that's not going to stop me from looking at it. The issue is what you do it from a long-term perspective. I'll give you a good example, it really isn't commodity, but sometimes you do think that maybe it's not the perfect fit but turn out to be quite well. When we bought West Coast, Union Gas, which is still in our portfolio and we have well in excess of a couple of billion dollars of expansion projects for utility would expect on pipeline, that may not have fit perfectly but it's been a good generator. Meanwhile, other utilities that we held when we bought West Coast, we have sold those assets. So I think it's -- none of that would have stopped the big price of what we looked at on West Coast, which was really the pipeline operations that we liked in Canada. But the focus is definitely from a fee-based perspective."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered very strong ongoing EBITDA for the quarter. But before I get into the details of those res",1352,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered very strong ongoing EBITDA for the quarter. But before I get into the details of those results, I want to discuss some special items we recorded during the quarter, as shown on Slide 3.
There were 3 special items which lowered reported EBITDA by $217 million or $0.20 per share. As you can see on this slide, only 1 of these items affected DCF by $11 million. The first item is $194 million pretax, noncash charge, or $122 million after-tax, which represents our 50% share of a goodwill impairment at DCP. The second item also is associated with DCP and is a pretax, noncash charge of $12 million related to our share of a loss on the sale of an asset during the quarter. Lastly, Western Canada recorded a pretax special item of $11 million related to employee and overhead reductions. We expect there will be some incremental charges of less than $10 million related to these efforts that will be recorded in the third and fourth quarters.
Our ongoing EBITDA increased year-over-year, so let's turn to those results, which really tell the story of the strength and resilience of our business model. As noted, we delivered very strong second quarter results with ongoing EBITDA of $652 million at Spectra Energy and $456 million at Spectra Energy Partners. Given the current macro environment, it is significant that Spectra Energy's ongoing EBITDA increased 4% quarter-over-quarter. 
As we've consistently demonstrated year after year, our portfolio of assets is structured to moderate the effect of various business cycles and maximize the upside benefits. And with approximately 95% fee-based earnings at U.S. Transmission that have no exposure to commodity price or volume fluctuations, SEP is a standout in the MLP space. 
So let's take a look at the drivers of our results by segment. I'll start with Spectra Energy Partners, whose EBITDA was up almost 30%. SEP is comprised of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses and is shown on the upper-right hand corner of Slide 4. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $396 million, up $76 million. That is almost 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Results for the 2015 quarter were driven primarily by increased earnings from expansion projects placed into service, specifically, TEAM 2014, TEAM South and the Kingsport project.
Our Liquids business reported second quarter EBITDA of $78 million compared with $51 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and tariffs on the Express crude pipeline, as well as higher equity earnings from the increased volumes on the Sand Hills natural gas liquids pipeline. As you can see, SEP is performing very well and delivering results ahead of our expectations.
Moving to the table on the left-hand side of this slide, distribution reported second quarter EBITDA of $98 million compared to $112 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due almost entirely to the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, which was down 13% this quarter compared with 2014.
Western Canada recorded ongoing EBITDA for the quarter of $115 million compared to $111 million last year. Higher earnings in Empress offset the effects of the lower Canadian dollar.
With respect to FX, the 13% reduction in the Canadian dollar affected EBITDA for both our Canadian business segments by $26 million quarter-over-quarter. Fortunately, about 2/3 of that number is naturally hedged on a net income basis, so the change in net income related to FX was only $6 million.
Now, a number of you have expressed interest in how the current operating environment in Western Canada might affect our business risk going forward. So I want to take a moment and speak to the business model of that segment. 
First, 95% of our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. While the Canadian pipeline model is similar to the model used in the U.S., it's important to remember that the Western Canadian G&P structure is different from the more commodity-sensitive model that largely exists across the U.S. G&P business.
Second, as you're aware, we implemented a risk management program at our Empress processing facility to reduce cash flow volatility. At our February Analyst Day, we said that we expected Empress to generate approximately $30 million of cash this year, and we're on track to exceed that forecast for 2015 given the hedges we put in place.
Looking forward to 2016, we've hedged about half of our targeted sales levels at positive margins, and we will continue to opportunistically layer in hedges as the year progresses. It's also important to note that nearly all of our Empress propane and butane sales contracts and our hedging program are linked to Conway and Mont Belvieu pricing, not Edmonton.
Moving on to DCP. Our 50% share of DCP's ongoing EBITDA was a negative $27 million in the quarter compared with $54 million last year. As expected, the decrease is primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices, which are down about 50% from last year's levels. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings growth -- or increased earnings from asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and savings from other strategic initiatives.
While we'd all love to see stronger commodity prices and positive earnings at DCP, I would remind you of the counterintuitive effect DCP's lower earnings have on Spectra Energy's cash flows. Since distributions from DCP can't drop below 0, its negative earnings benefit our DCF by ultimately lowering our cash taxes. 
So overall, Spectra Energy's ongoing EBITDA was up quarter-over-quarter despite both lower commodity prices and the lower Canadian currency. And again, the results at SEP reflect its significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure.
Importantly, these results exceeded our budget expectations for the 2015 quarter. Let's take a look at our DCF schedules, beginning with SEP, as shown on Slide 5. SEP's standalone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, $82 million more than the same quarter last year with distribution coverage of 1.3x. This higher DCF was directly attributable to the higher EBITDA I just described. For the full year, we expect SEP's coverage to be at least 1.1x, consistent with our 2015 forecast.
SEP paid general partner and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $56 million and $145 million, respectively. And earlier this morning, SEP announced its 31st consecutive quarterly distribution increase of $0.0125 per unit. We continue to see strong interest in our ATM program at SEP. To this point in the year, SEP has raised almost $350 million through this vehicle. Given the attractiveness of SEP's investor value proposition and the lack of commodity and volume exposure, we expect continued utilization of the ATM program throughout the year and can further expand the program if needed.
Let's turn now to Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow, as shown on Slide 6. At Spectra Energy, distributable cash flow was $274 million for the quarter, in line with last year. Coverage is 1.1x and DCF per share was $0.41. Year-to-date, we're at 1.7x coverage and by the end of the year, we expect coverage to be at least 1.2x, consistent with the forecast we provided at the beginning of the year.
Total available liquidity across the entire Spectra Energy enterprise was $3.5 billion as of June 30. So while we still have a little less than half a year to go, we're feeling very good about how the business has continued to perform. We're ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point in time in terms of EBITDA and DCF despite the current environment. We're very pleased with our performance to date and expect to continue to deliver on the commitments we made for the balance of the year.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."
610501,306267434,850038,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks very much, Pat, and good morning everybody.

As you just heard, the results we delivered this quarter underscore the stability of our overall earnings and cash-generation capabilities. I think that stability comes from a well-positioned, high-performing portfolio of assets that allows us to generate value-creating DCF regardless of commodity or market fluctuations. It also reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver ongoing annual dividend growth of $0.14 per share while maintaining coverage at or above 1. Pat mentioned that we realized strong results for the quarter at both Spectra Energy and SEP. That's significant and worth repeating. We believe the strength of our businesses and financial structure are important differentiators, allowing us to deliver consistent and dependable growth.
With everything that's occurring in the energy space, I want to take a minute to share our priorities for driving growth and increasing shareholder returns for both Spectra Energy and SEP investors. It goes without saying that safe, reliable operations of our assets is a big element of Spectra Energy's success, and so we are steadfastly focused on day-to-day operations. That focus ensures that our customers' requirements are met in a safe and responsible manner. And my confidence in our operating team's abilities gives me more time to concentrate on 4 other major areas. 
First, ensuring that we successfully execute on the secured project backlog that we already have and that we do so on time and on budget. Our execution advantage really does differentiate us, especially when you consider that most projects take several years to come into service given the current regulatory process. As you can imagine, this is no small undertaking, but we continue to deliver. This year, we've already put $600 million of expansion capital into service, and this amount will grow to more than $2 billion by year-end.
Second, I'm focused on securing contracts for projects that are in development. While our track record would suggest we're successful in signing up the majority of projects we pursue, we know it's not possible to secure all of them. With that said, we continue to expect that we will secure contracts of at least another $20 billion at attractive returns by the end of the decade. To date, this year alone, we've moved more than $1 billion of projects into execution and we expect to add to that in a meaningful way by year-end.
Third, with our partner, Phillips 66, we continue to focus on the appropriate structure of DCP to ensure that DCP and DPM are set up in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the owners to realize their value. As we said before, we expect this matter will be resolved in the October timeframe. As we work our way through the process, our ultimate objective remains ensuring that any structuring outcome still allows DCP's enterprise to retain and grow its #1 position in NGL production and gas processing, and that it positions DCP to efficiently finance that growth.
Lastly, I'm watching for industry consolidation opportunities that fit our portfolio strategically and add value to our shareholders. Our current Drive to 35 backlog does not contemplate any M&A activity. But as we've mentioned before, we're constantly looking at opportunities to complement our business portfolio and profile and advance our value-creation objectives.
So with that, let me now turn to our projects in execution. As you've heard Pat mention, Spectra Energy and SEP's second quarter results benefited from new assets we successfully put in the ground last year. But we have also had 2 projects that moved into service since our last earnings call totaling about $600 million, so let me begin with those.
At U.S. Transmission, the Union Gas -- the Uniontown to Gas City project commenced service well ahead of its original November 1 in-service date, and DCP placed the Lucerne II processing plant in the DJ Basin into service since our last call, along with several smaller gathering projects. We also have about $1.6 billion in projects that are nearing completion and are on track to go into service later this year. 
Our OPEN Project will bring incremental Marcellus and Utica supply to Southern markets beginning in November, if not sooner. Our 2015 Dawn-Parkway project is scheduled to go into service at Union Gas during the fourth quarter. DCP's in the final stages of starting up its CO2 processing plant in the Permian. And at our Liquids segment, the Red Lake lateral to expand the reach of Sand Hills to access growing Permian production will go fully into service once CO2 comes online. 
Placing projects into service on time or even ahead of schedule is an example of how we've built our track record of delivering on our execution promises, an advantage for both customers and, of course, investors. We've got a full complement of great projects in execution, which are detailed on this slide. I'll start by highlighting 3 new projects that we recently moved into execution. You'll recall that during last quarter, we mentioned open seasons that were underway for projects that would further connect Marcellus and Utica supply to demand markets. Since then, we moved our Lebanon Extension project into execution. We've secured commercial commitments for the project and are proceeding with the FERC approval process, and anticipate a 2017 in-service date.
We also moved the High Pine project into execution. High Pine is another project in Western Canada that will further expand the BC Pipeline. You'll recall that we announced the binding open season for this project during our last earnings call, and we were able to quickly execute our commercial agreement to move the project forward. This $325 million project with have a late 2016 in-service date.
Another project we moved into execution this past quarter is the 2017 Dawn-Parkway project at Union Gas. Commercial contracts underpinning this $620 million project have been executed, and the facility's application has been filed for approval with the Ontario Energy Board. 
Other projects in execution are also proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. All of these projects are underpinned by executed customer agreements that are unaffected by commodity market conditions. In fact, you'll note that about 75% of our expansion CapEx is driven by natural gas demand pull projects rather than supply push.
During the quarter, both the AIM and 2016 Dawn-Parkway projects began construction and are on track to be in service in the second half of 2016.  NEXUS is on track for its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. We completed a major milestone in the regulatory process for this project by submitting our FERC resource reports in June, and we anticipate filing a formal FERC application later this year.
Our execution efforts also continue on 2 projects in Western Canada to expand our BC Pipeline: the Jackfish Lake and RAM projects. We expect both of these pipeline expansions to go into service during 2017. As you know, LNG projects on the West Coast of Canada and the U.S. have been delayed given current market dynamics. However, producers still need to move natural gas. So this LNG deferment has led to these new opportunities for us in our Western Canadian pipeline, totaling about $1 billion already this year.
The pipeline expansion opportunities we're seeing in British Columbia underscore the benefit of having an expansive and strategic existing footprint in our region. At a time when the Montney region producers are looking for the lowest-cost option to move their product quickly to the Pacific Northwest or Eastern Canada or Alberta markets, having steel in the ground already is clearly a competitive advantage for us.
So wrapping up the review of projects in execution, we will have brought more than $2 billion of projects into service by year-end, creating additional earnings and cash flow for 2016 and beyond. We're making great progress on all of our projects in execution, and we continue to further expand our execution backlog by adding about $1 billion of projects over just this last quarter.
You've seen our impressive slate of projects in service and in execution, projects that would deliver the earnings in cash flow we laid in our 3-year plan for you in January, February. In addition to our backlog of projects in execution, we have a healthy portfolio of opportunities in development that will lead to continued growth, and we're working diligently to move those projects forward.
Let me take a look at some of our projects that are in development. Access Northeast, under development with Eversource and National Grid, continues to advance quite nicely. Unlike other projects in the region, which are intended to serve gas LDCs in New England, Access Northeast will serve the electric power market. Project customers, including Eversource, National Grid and Central Maine Power serve more than 80% of the 6.5 million electric customers in the region. The project will expand the Algonquin and Maritime systems, utilizing their existing footprints. We expect the customers to file agreements with their respective PUCs soon, and we anticipate moving Access Northeast into execution later this year or early 2016, once state regulatory approvals have been received by our customers.
An interesting note for you, we've already seen a record summertime demand from power generators on our existing Algonquin and Texas Eastern lines this year, with new #1 delivery days of more than 800 million cubic feet a day on each of these lines and daily average deliveries to power generators up 21% over '14 on Algonquin and up 33% over 2014 on the east end of Market Zone 3 at TETCO. Also under development are 2 Marcellus and Utica expansion projects, the Greater Philadelphia Expansion and Marcellus to Market projects, which received positive responses to open seasons during the quarter, and discussions with potential customers are underway.
Moving to Western Canada. We kicked off another binding open season in late July to further expand the T-North section of the BC Pipeline, and we expect the results from that this fall. As I mentioned earlier, we're extremely pleased with the level of producer interest we're seeing for our BC Pipeline and we're exploring ways to further serve producers in the Montney region.
Customer interest also remains strong on our large-scale crude oil projects in development. While we continue to expect a late-in-the-decade timeframe to secure commitments to advance these projects, in the interim, we'll seek smaller-scale optimization projects similar to the $135 million Express Enhancement project currently in execution.
To summarize, we made significant progress during the quarter on our Drive to 35. In fact, we're more than halfway to our goal, with $8.2 billion in service now and $9.6 billion in execution as I speak. We continue to advance our projects in execution and development to generate incremental cash flow and, of course, shareholder value.
As you've heard today, Spectra Energy delivered solid results for the quarter. We're disappointed, of course, that our stock price isn't reflecting the strong performance of our businesses. We're not alone. The energy sector is being painted with a far-too-broad brush and suffering the consequences of perceptions that all energy cash flows are correlated to commodity prices. That's just not the case, of course, and certainly not the case for Spectra Energy and SEP. The current environment allows investors to differentiate between investment options. So let me take a minute to remind you why Spectra Energy and SEP are best-in-class investment opportunities.
We understand what investors are looking for and Spectra Energy and SEP offer all those attributes. Specifically, we know that investors prefer strong portfolios. Our unrivaled footprint connects all the major North American supply basins with growing demand markets. You could not replicate our geographic positioning nor reach today. Our healthy mix of businesses are structured to minimize the effect of multiple and varied market cycles.
Next we know that stable, reliable cash flows are important for investors as well. As we told you back in February, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for the 2015 to 2017 period will come from our fee-based businesses, and our DCF forecast is virtually unexposed to incremental commodity downside. And SEP is fairly unique in the MLP space, as 95% of U.S. Transmission revenues, the largest component of SEP and Spectra Energy for that matter, is reservation based with no commodity nor volume exposure. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years. And the Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, thanks to the contract restructuring we've done since acquiring this system in 2013.
Investors seek companies with robust growth profiles, and again, we're making great progress on our Drive to 35. By 2020, we'll grow our EBITDA by about $1 billion and approximately $800 million at Spectra Energy and SEP, respectively, as the projects that we have in execution are moved into service and begin generating cash. And with the ongoing growth in the demand for natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, we have tremendous confidence in realizing our projects in development.
Healthy financials are also important and we have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our growth projects and pursue new opportunities. We have 2 solid currencies, strong investment-grade balance sheets and disciplined financial management. Investors look for strong track records and proven performance, and you've heard me talk about our execution advantage, and that's another feature that sets us apart. Since 2007, we've delivered more than 70 projects into service for a capital expansion investment of about $9 billion, a record that speaks to our level of accountability and achievement.
Lastly and most importantly, investors want attractive returns and Spectra Energy has done that. In the past 5 years, our annual dividend per share has grown from $1 to $1.48, and we're committed to continuing to grow Spectra Energy's dividend by at least $0.14 per share through 2017. Similarly, SEP has delivered 31 consecutive quarters of distribution growth and we're committed to continuing that track record with an 8% to 9% annual growth rate through 2017.
So those are the attributes that differentiate Spectra Energy and SEP from other energy companies, and why we believe so strongly that both entities offer a best-in-class investment opportunity today.
With that, let me turn things over to Julie to take your questions on the quarter."

And while you're right, you're seeing rig counts come off, you are still seeing a lot of gas being produced. And I think you see that affect hitting our pipeline business, which is, as you know, is a very long-term fee-based contract perspective. And I'm not sure many people would have predicted that Spectra Energy would have added $1 billion in pipeline projects this year into our backlog out of Western Canada. And I think that you're going to have ebb and flows between G&P and from pipelines, but investors in the E&P business are going to be happy that the producers have pipelines that can take gas down to the Pacific Northwest and Alberta. So lots of solutions being worked out, but I don't see a huge NGL solution in the near term in Western Canada."

Now at the end of contract life, just like on a pipeline in the United States or Canada, you are exposed to recontracting. So that's obviously, that's something you're always looking at.

The first on the 2 Appalachian expansion projects that you discussed. Just given the recent shift in basin dynamics and not only the imbalance between supply growth and demand, but a lot of the pipe options out of the region and the impact on regional pricing differentials may be shifting economics or, at least, netback incentives.

Maybe a better way to ask the question is, if you could kind of quantify or give us some color on what a positive response to the open season means.

So you will see the projects ebb and flow in terms of their size. I don't think there's anything, I mean, restricting customers from signing up. Sure, E&P customers are very focused on their cap spend and where they think commodity prices will go. But -- and I think the Lebanon project, as you'll see on one of the slides that we put out of the $9 billion, we did put it into execution this quarter, Darren. And I would say, it's lumped in with the Access South and Adair Southwest expansion because they really are, in many respects, for some different customers, achieving similar-type goals. So even in the way we're going to FERC and have those approved, we have lumped in as one project. So you continue to see projects morph. I think the underlying facet that's really critical and a real advantage for Spectra, we already have assets in the ground so we're going to -- and I hear a lot of discussion about reversing flows and stuff. Please, guys, we've been doing that for a number of years now. So I know other folks are starting to think and get to that.

But I'm wondering, just with some of the different proposed consolidation dynamics, economies of scale and what could come out of that area over the next possibly 12 to 18 months, how could that impact Access Northeast either at an ultimate scale/scope from a timing perspective or from a further growth opportunity standpoint?"

I would also say that doesn't take away from any other projects that are also needed out there. Remember, our AIM, our Atlantic Bridge projects are about LDCs, that's already in execution, well in execution. The other projects about -- the Access Northeast is about electric. Other folks' major projects being pitched are LDC-related projects. So I think the dynamics don't allow for changes. I think the dynamics that we're seeing are more like additional projects that will be coming forth over the following year. So if you think that we've got -- we have 16, 17, 18 projects coming into service. If you look at gas demand in North America going from 75 call it Bcf a day to 100 Bcf, 110 Bcf a day in the next 10 years, despite what any brilliant policy might be coming out of various government officials, that will happen.

Back to the point I was making that anytime we can get their project the heck away from supply area into demand area, they'll take it all day long. So we're pushing as hard as we can. We obviously have a very systematic approach to doing projects. This is not a new area for us. We're talking half a century of building stuff there and we're going to take advantage of that."

We signed -- we have long-term contracts, cost-of-service based. I think it's a combination of both a longer-term solution. Look, I will be surprised to see any LNG on the West Coast of North America, definitely not going to happen before 2020 at this point in time, even if you saw approvals happen instantly, just the amount of work that has to gets done. So whether you think a 6- to 10-year solution is long term or not, but I think you're talking about a while before those projects kick in. And remember, as demand grows across North America, the Pacific Northwest, Alberta production is often -- has been declining, so Western Canada is not a single market. And you're still seeing activity going on from a demand perspective in the oil sands, of which much of the fuel they need to use is natural gas. So yes, I mean, there's no doubt the opportunity has been created by LNG deferment. But the amount of gas we're talking about is nowhere near the amount of gas that would be needed for LNG. So one is not going to replace the other, the LNG would just be incremental to that."

The issue is what do you do with it from a long-term perspective. I'll give you a good example, it really isn't commodity, but sometimes you do things that, maybe it's not a perfect fit, but turn out to be quite well. When we bought West Coast, Union Gas, which is still in our portfolio and we have well in excess of a couple of billion dollars of expansion projects for a utility you wouldn't expect on pipelines, that may not have fit perfectly but it's been a good generator. Meanwhile, other utilities that we held when we bought West Coast, we have sold those assets.

You had sort of talked about the perverse tax benefit as a result, and so you -- basically, the more DCP loses, effectively, the better it is for you on a cash flow basis, at least in the near term until you max out the tax benefit. But if there's any change in Spectra's ownership of the GP, let's say, one of the solutions is somebody injects capital, you find a partner and your ownership is diluted, let's say, down to 20% or 25%. Would that change your ability to continue to have that tax benefit? Or you would still continue to have equity method accounting and it would still flow through?"

Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio,",1276,"Well thank you, Julie, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio, which is structured to moderate the effects of various business cycles and preserve the upside benefits in the recovery phase. Spectra Energy Partners' EBITDA for the quarter was $467 million, $66 million higher than the same quarter last year and ongoing EBITDA of Spectra Energy was $634 million, down $70 million from the prior year quarter. Spectra Energy's ongoing results exclude special items of $26 million, all at DCP, and primarily from the gain on sale of an asset. 
Turning to the drivers of our ongoing results by segment. Let's start with Spectra Energy Partners, where EBITDA was up approximately 16% quarter-over-quarter. That CP consists of our U.S. Transmission and liquids businesses, and is shown in the upper right-hand corner of Slide 3. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $401 million, up $49 million over last year. These quarterly EBITDA results reflect increased earnings at U.S. Transmission and are attributable to expansion projects placed into service in the prior year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, as well as those placed into full or partial service in the third quarter of this year, Uniontown to Gas City end OPEN, respectively. Both of these projects came into service earlier than expected, building on our lengthening record of excellence and execution. Our base business continues to perform well and I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a renewal rate of about 98% of our contracted revenue on the U.S. natural gas pipelines, which is an indication of the value of our underlying base business. 
The Liquids business reported third quarter EBITDA of $79 million, compared with $60 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement is attributable mainly to higher transportation revenues due to increased tariff rates and volumes on the Express pipeline. 
Let's move now to our Canadian business segments, which are shown on the left-hand side of the slide. While our 3-year plan anticipated a lower Canadian dollar in 2015 compared to 2014, for the quarter, the Canadian dollar was 14% weaker than our planned and assumed. As a result, the FX effect on EBITDA for our Canadian business segment this quarter compared to the same quarter last year was $14 million at distribution and $24 million at Western Canada or $38 million in total. As a reminder, about 2/3 of our currency exposure is naturally hedged at the net income level on an annual basis. 
For the quarter, the reduction in net income from controlling interest related to FX was $18 million. Distribution reported third quarter EBITDA of $70 million compared with $82 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was driven by the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. The base business remained strong and excluding the effect of FX, distribution would have reported EBITDA that was higher quarter-over-quarter due to customer growth. 
Western Canada reported EBITDA of $117 million compared with $156 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease quarter-over-quarter is due entirely to the effect of the lower Canadian dollar I mentioned previously, combined with lower earnings and interest. The risk management program implemented at Empress, including the hedges that we have in place, continues to support our view that Empress will generate cash of $30 million this year. 
Also as a reminder, our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. We continue to monitor the current macro environment and producer activity in Western Canada as there have been slowdowns in some areas. We remain focused on continued prudent cost management to respond to the changing environment in Western Canada. 
Moving on to DCP, you'll recall that what we show here as Spectra Energy's EBITDA from Field Services actually represents our 50% share of DCP's earnings before income taxes, plus gains from the DP unit issuances. Excluding the effect of special items, DCP's year-to-date EBITDA on a stand-alone basis is about $500 million, which is an indication of the strength of this business even in the current market environment. For the quarter, we reported ongoing EBITDA from Field Services at negative $29 million compared with $63 million last year. The 2015 period excludes special items of $26 million as previously mentioned. The 2014 period excludes special items of $12 million, mainly due to a goodwill impairment. 
The decrease in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by continued lower commodity prices and lower gains on DP and unit issuances, if decreases were partially offset by asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and other initiatives. We're pleased with all of the actions that have been taken to strengthen DCP and Greg will speak more about that in a minute. 
So all in all, it was a solid quarter for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. Importantly, these results have us ahead of our expectations at this point in the year, and we expect to meet or exceed our full-year plan and deliver on the significant financial commitments we made at the beginning of the year. 
Let's take a look at our distributable cash flow schedules, beginning with SEP as shown on our Slide 4. SEP's stand-alone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $270 million, an increase of $23 million over the prior year quarter. The higher DCF was attributable to the higher EBITDA I previously mentioned and reflects SEP's significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure. The quarterly or year-to-date results are consistent with our 2015 planned expectations to achieve full year coverage of 1.1x. SEP quarter of $61 million and $148 million respectively. In addition, SEP continued to grow its distribution with its recently announced 32nd consecutive quarterly distribution increase. 
Turning to Slide 5. Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow of $223 million for the quarter compared with $236 million last year. The lower DCF is prime attributable to receiving no distributions from DCP this quarter versus $43 million last year. Both quarterly and year-to-date results for DCF are consistent with our plan to achieve full year distribution coverage of 1.2x. 
SEP's ATM program continues to attract investor interest, and as a result, we don't anticipate accessing the equity markets through any vehicle other than our ATM program for the remainder of this year. For the year to date, SEP has raised $450 million through its ATM. We also have significant liquidity available across the company, totaling $3.4 billion as of September 30th. This financial flexibility gives us confidence in our continued capacity to successfully fund our growth projects in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
We know that investors are interested in the credit quality of our customers so I want to mention that 90% of our revenues are contracted with customers who are investment grade or are secured by investment grade equivalents like letters of credit. Overall, our base businesses continued to perform well, generating stable and sustainable earnings and cash flow. Our financial results are ahead of our expectations, even with commodity and FX headwinds, and we have the financial flexibility to fund our growth projects efficiently while staying on track to meet or exceed our 2015 EBITDA and DCF objectives. 
As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $0.14 annual dividend increase guidance we shared with you earlier this year. So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you've just said, we achieved another solid quarter from both a financial and execution perspective. The results we delivered this quarter continue to underscore the strength and resilience of our portfolio of businesses. SEP has no commodity and virtually no volume exposure and Spectra Energy's exposure to commodity is limited to 1% of our forecasted EBITDA. In the current environment, this limited commodity and volume exposure, coupled with our track record of consistently doing what we say we'll do, are important risk differentiators for us versus many others in the midstream space. 
Our focus continues to be on operating our business safely and reliably and delivering on our growth and dividend promises for investors, in both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. 
You've previously seen this slide outlining our priorities. So let me provide an update on our progress. First, we're very pleased that the recent transactions initiated by Spectra Energy and Phillips 66 to strengthen DCP are complete, with the transactions closing on October 30th As we've said previously, the contributions made by the owners, along with the other initiatives underway at DCP, established a foundation for sustainable cash flows at DCP Midstream over the longer run. DCP quickly adjusted to the rapidly changing industry environment and continues to be extremely diligent in taking actions of its own to insure its longer term success. Over the past year, DCP has engaged in various self-help initiatives, including the sale of $200 million of noncore or underperforming assets, producing base cuts by approximately $70 million and launching the restructuring of its commodity-sensitive contracts, which combined with hedging, will decrease fee-based earnings. As an example, you may have seen the recent announcement of a 10-year renewal of contract with one of the largest investment grade independent producers in the Permian. This contract has been converted at significantly better margins from a percent of proceeds to 100% fee-based and covers approximately 1 million dedicated acres. DCP is on track, if not slightly ahead, of where they need to be to achieve their contract conversion goal of reducing 1/3 of its commodity exposed NGL length by the end of 2017. 
With the support provided by the owners, and DCP's own initiatives, it's our view that DCP has the ability to realize breakeven cash flows and make ongoing positive economic contribution to the owners at current commodity prices, while remaining well positioned to further benefit from industry recovery. 
This turnaround is significant and a direct reflection of all the actions taken to strengthen this must-run business. 
Next, completing our secured backlog and doing so on time and on budget continues to be key to our execution advantage. We also remain diligent in advancing and securing projects in development to ensure we deliver on our growth objectives. Finally, we continue to believe there will be industry consolidation opportunities and that could advance our value creation objectives and complement our business profile. 
With that, let me update you on the projects we have in execution. You've seen this slide many times before and it's a great scorecard to track the success that we've had so far in executing on our growth plans. Not only are we consistently demonstrating that our project development timelines and budgets are reliable but also that we're able to realize some upside from placing projects into service early. Our Uniontown to Gas City project began delivering gas to the Midwest on August 1st and was fully in-service September 1, 2 full months ahead of the schedule. Additionally, the first segment of OPEN was also put into service about 6 weeks ahead of schedule and the remaining portion of OPEN has a November in-service date. We're very proud of the track record on project execution and pleased with the growth that these projects offer our investors. Since our last earnings call, we've moved $1.4 billion of expansion projects into service. And by year end, that number will be almost $1.9 billion as we will place the 2015 Dawn-Parkway project fully into service, consistent with the originally planned in-service date. 
In aggregate, the expansion projects that will be placed into service this year, excluding those at DCP, will generate $135 million of EBITDA annually. These projects are fee-based, with no commodity or volume exposure, further adding to the stability of Spectra Energy's and Spectra Energy Partners' earnings and cash flows. 
Overall, 2015 will be a successful year for delivering projects into service and demonstrating our project execution advantage. Looking forward, our project backlog is almost $9 billion of projects still to be placed into service. As a reminder, all of these projects are underpinned by executed customer agreements. You'll also notice that about 75% of our expansion CapEx in execution, is supported by secure contracts with demand-pull customers such as gas, local gas distribution companies, further demonstrating the strength of our current project backlog in this environment. 
All of our projects in execution are proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. Here's an indication of the great progress we've been making since our last earnings call. We have filed 4 regulatory applications for several U.S. projects: Atlantic Bridge, Penn East, Access South, Adair Southwest and the Lebanon extension. In Western Canada, the Jackfish Lake, RAM and High Pine projects have either already been filed or will be filed this month with the National Energy Board. These projects represent about $1 billion of low-risk cost of service pipeline expansions. 
In addition, construction is underway on AIM, the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project and the Express Enhancement project and we are on track to begin construction on Sabal Trail next year. A significant milestone will be met on NEXUS later this month when the project files its FERC application. 
Let's take a closer look at NEXUS and the progress we're making on that particular project. Many of your are familiar with NEXUS but I want to take this opportunity to remind you of the scope of the project that we are jointly developing with DTE. The NEXUS project is a 250-mile 1.5 Bcf a day pipeline that will originate at Kensington, Ohio and connect with DTE Gas in Michigan. This path will utilize TETCO, DTE gas and vector pipelines. That project represents tremendous opportunities for customers to access gas from both the Utica and Marcellus and move it through markets in Ohio and Michigan, to the 150 Bcf a day Dawn storage hub, the second largest physical trading gas hub in North America and which is owned and operated by our own Union Gas. 
NEXUS is a key strategic project for us as it will ultimately connect Texas Eastern with the unit gas system, something we've been envisioning for our customers for many years. To complete the upstream path of NEXUS, we're advancing the TEO project, an expansion of TETCO, to offer customers greater supply axis and market connectivity by transporting gas on Texas Eastern to Kensington Ohio. We'll be filing our FERC application for later this month. As you know, downstream from NEXUS are the Union Gas 51. billion Dawn to Parkway expansions, which provide customers in Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S. access to supply directly at the dawn on [Audio Gap]"
610501,313038623,891584,"Spectra Energy Corp., Spectra Energy Partners, LP, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Attendees","And as I mentioned earlier, the first phase of the Union Dawn, Union Gas Dawn-Parkway expansion projects will be completed later this year.

NEXUS is moving forward with the support from executing customer agreements with LDCs to demand-pull markets as well as Marcellus and Utica producers. We've also recently find a number of interconnect agreements with industrial facilities and power generators that could connect incremental load across northern Ohio with up to 1.4 Bcf a day. Importantly, this demonstrates strong long-term market support for our root and the project and we continue to see increased production forecast for the Appalachian region. We have achieved several milestones in NEXUS this year, including the January approval by FERC to use the prefiling review process, selection of an EPCM contractor and securing pipe for the project and as mentioned, NEXUS will file its FERC application later this month and we would expect FERC to issue its approval to proceed in the second half of '16, thereby allowing us to achieve our in-service date of late 2017. 
So we're pleased with the progress we're making on NEXUS as well as the progress we continue to make in all of our projects in execution. When this backlog of projects is in-service along with the others, we'll place them into service this year, investors can expect these projects to generate about $1 billion of EBITDA by 2020. 
Let's now shift our focus to projects in development. In addition to our backlog of projects in execution, we've got a robust portfolio of opportunities and development that will lead to continued growth in 2018 and beyond, and we're working diligently towards advancing those projects. We continue to make progress on our Access Northeast project, which is an expansion of our Algonquin system to serve the New England power generation markets and address electric reliability concerns during peak periods. 
This reliability is becoming a more critical concern each year as additional coal, oil and nuclear plants are announcing retirements. Key to Access Northeast is recognizing the importance of being directly connected to 60% of New England's gas-fired electric generators gas deliveries to electric generators can only be guaranteed for those with the last mile firm transportation contracts. Electric generators without last mile firm transportation contracts have no guarantees of gas deliveries on peak demand days, regardless if firm contracts may have another pipeline. Access Northeast will largely solve this issue. Earlier this week, we filed with FERC to use the prefiling review process for this project. At the state level, we are at a positive turning point to support for our approach and for the electric distribution companies to secure capacity continues to build with a series of separate but very consistent actions across the different states. 
Rhode Island's Affordable Clean Energy Security Act of 2014 authorizes the division of public utilities and carriers and the office and energy resources to develop an issue of open and competitive solicitations for infrastructure projects in clean energy resources. Last month, in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities confirmed its legal authority to review and approve EDC contracts to enhance electric reliability and reduce energy costs. The main PUC's ongoing proceedings has recognized the benefit of examining a regional electrical lability solution for main customers. Connecticut continues to make progress toward their RP, focused on ensuring electric reliability as outlined in legislation passed and in New Hampshire, the PUC staff has issued a report supporting the legal authority for EDCs to enter into gas pipeline capacity contracts. We've made significant progress since the region's governors came together around the reliability challenge they identified in 2013. We're optimistic that before the year is over, some of the electric distribution companies will be filing contracts for state approval. As a result, with all this positive momentum, we're now even more confident in our ability to move Access Northeast into execution in the first half of 2016. 
We continue to actively pursue many other projects in development and have ongoing productive discussions with potential customers. Interest remains strong in many of these projects, particularly those that are demand-pull. Supply-pushed discussions are proceeding at a slower pace in the current market environment. However, we remain confident that this infrastructure is needed and will ultimately be secured by the end of the decade. 
We will continue to actively engage with the market as the energy environment involves and aggressively pursue the other projects in development. Two years ago, our Drive to 35 originated from our expectation that we have the ability to secure contracts and pursue organic growth projects totaling $35 billion. To date, we've been very successful on our efforts with almost $10 billion in-service and delivering cash and almost $9 billion remaining in our secured project execution backlog, which will add incremental cash flow beyond the current period. We will continue to focus our efforts on organic growth since it's the most economically attractive way to grow, albeit often at a slower pace. We're not dependent on M&A to achieve our Drive to 35. However, the current environment may provide good opportunities to participate in industry consolidation, which could in fact expedite our efforts to achieve that goal. 
So we continue to deliver solid results, further proof of the resiliency of our underlying businesses and continued demonstration of our execution advantage. As I mentioned last quarter, not only do we believe that investors are beginning to differentiate between investment options in this environment but also that Spectra Energy and SEP offer best-in-class investment opportunities. Spectra Energy Partners is one of the lowest risk MLP investments available, offering investors visible growth. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years and these are reservation-based contracts. An Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, revenues at our reservation base with no commodity exposure and virtually no volume exposure, allowing us to provide quarterly distribution growth for investors every quarter for the last 8 years. And we're committed to continuing that track record with 8% to 9% annual growth. 
Simply put, SEP is the most prudent, steady large pipeline MLP in existence today. Spectra Energy offers an unrivaled footprint that connects all of the major North American supply basins with demand markets, its first and last mile advantage. With more than 1/2 its EBITDA coming from SEP stable and reliable earnings, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for 2015 to '17 period will come from our fee-based business. There's virtually no further commodity downside to our DCF forecast if commodity prices move slower. As such, we remain committed to growing Spectra Energy's annual dividend by $0.14 per share through 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our impressive backlog of secured growth projects and pursuing new opportunities. We get two strong currencies for Spectra Energy shares and Spectra Energy Partners. Both companies have investment grade balance sheets, which we're committed to and we are disciplined in our financial management. So those are the attributes we believe differentiates Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners from other energy companies and while we believe so strongly that both our companies offer best-in-class low risk investment opportunities today. With that, let me turn things over to Julie so that we can take your questions."

I will add to that too, we have 4 other generators if you think about the power in this region, potential coal conversions and retirements. We've got 4 generators we're talking to that they total about 3,000 megawatts net of the another half of Bcf on top of that, so really good load there."

So I don't think the delta between the has come down entirely yet but again as each quarter goes on and people see the strength of those people with the pipeline assets like we have that have very steady, reliable and have committed to 8%, 9% type growth, that's going to be rewarded versus some folks who have maybe much loftier suggestions that people are going to realize in this environment as not possible.

And we're not seeing any pullback in costs on those fronts. People are building projects in highly concentrated areas. As we all know, regulatory processes don't get any easier. Land issues, labor is tight in those locations. You can move steel from one part of the continent to the opposite side but you can't move people that way. I think the savings, because of the relatively weak energy environment are not really showing up in full pipeline construction. You're getting some benefits on hard product but again, most of the cuts are on the other side. So we feel good about our estimates but I don't see us seeing big cost savings in this environment."

So obviously, that would have a very significant impact for us on a positive basis with respect to 2016. When we laid out the plans last year, we did not assume that and that probably runs $200 million plus in terms of the benefit, Christine so obviously, we're watching that closely and are optimistic that that in fact will be the case."

Lastly, this is just kind of a macro question, not necessarily about your assets but maybe just Marcellus buildout in general. We are seeing some massive dry Utica well and if this continues, I would think natural gas prices stay lower for longer, possibly pricing out some producers who might not have that exposure. So maybe it becomes less producers each with more market share now. I would think some of the producers are not going to make it, especially given leverage and balance sheet issues. At what point should we be worried about some of the counterparties on all the pipelines that are currently being developed to get out of the region. I understand a lot of your build-out is underpinned by utilities but there is an element of supply-push out of the region so I would be curious as to your thoughts and maybe some insight into the landscape out there. Are there outs for some of these producers, if pipeline hasn't broken ground yet?"

I think if you look at the U.S. side of things or the top 10 customers, which are investment grade except for one, would account for 50% of the revenue that we have and in Canada, the same type of thing and all of those top 10, which account for 50% of revenue would be investment grade. So feel pretty good where we are but I think next spring is the time to kind of watch things. But I would also say just like we see it at DCP and our prices and you've seen with the producers talking about it this week and last week, but they're ripping at costs straight, left and center and so you're seeing some pretty dramatic drops in what you wouldn't have thought was a possible a year ago is.

And two, the big factors of that pipeline, Stat Oil and Chesapeake. But you can say okay, well Stat Oil's very solid. Chesapeake is not investment grade today, but where they are delivering that gas is absolutely probably the most profitable piece of capacity that they own. So I think you can look at it just but where is it going, and if you do not have first mile and last mile advantage, even if you've got contracts, I think you can have some challenges with your supply-push producers. If you've got that last mile advantage, that's going to be the most important project and our capacity that they will hold. So I don't think you can look at it just solely on who's back in the project. Where is it going? And where it is going is that the mid-market premium demand market. That's the real value that suppliers supply-push players will look for even in a down market."

We have a giveback of a limited term giveback of our GP interest. And so as we look pro forma on the effect of SEP, it's neutral and of course, that had to be the case to get the special committee to sign off on it. So don't see any pressure at all on SEP. If anything, it's perhaps slightly positive as we modeled it. So I don't think it changes at all the credit profile at SEP or how we'll fund growth there for the U.S. portion of our CapEx. At SEM consolidation, there is a small reduction obviously from the surrender of units and the GP get back. But given where we are in the IDRs, it's not the full amount of the EBITDA that was transferred to DCP. And ironically, given the strong benefit to DCP of what we did and what our partner did matching with cash, I believe we'll be in a situation to see cash distributions resume at DCP much earlier than they might have otherwise, in which case we'll get half back, if you think about it that way, of the contribution that we made. So net-net, for a company on top that has $3 billion of EBITDA, very small impact and no effect on SE's outlook for capital or credit."

SEP has added incremental projects and therefore, results for EBITDA going forward. Obviously, that comes to SE as well. So that's obviously, a positive from a credit perspective. Interest expense is it's staying lower and lower, so that's obviously, positive. And frankly, we've done better from a maintenance capital perspective moving some stuff into '15 and that's obviously going to help us because maintenance programs typically be multiyear projects in many respects and so moving some stuff into '15 given the results we have actually are helpful in '16, '17.

Conversations on the supply push aside are slower and more cautious, perhaps less so on the gas side today, definitely on the oil side. That's a very difficult discussion to have right now as people are just not certain where prices are going. We didn't have a whole lot, in fact very little in the way of oil projects until the end of the decade and infrastructures are still going to be be needed. So yes, you see it on the supply-side on the gas side but more so on the oil side. So but again, I'd go to where they're going to put their dollars when they have to for capacity is going to be with people like Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners who can get their product to the demand market. So again and you've heard us talk about this for years, last mile, first mile, last mile advantage is critical. Lots of people seem to have a first mile advantage from a supply perspective, but not having the last mile advantage, you're going to have a tough time filling up your pipes and if you did contracts with short term, 10 years or less, that's the folks I'd be watching. That's not what we did and those are going to be to tougher positions to find yourself in if you do not go to that last market. I think the supply push the producers are going to be looking for those types of contracts and saying, ""That's not really taking me to a premium market, do I need to re-up or do I need to even continue forward with that type of contract?"""

Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio",1284,"Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio, which is structured to moderate the effects of various business cycles and preserve the upside benefits in the recovery phase. Spectra Energy Partners' EBITDA for the quarter was $467 million, $66 million higher than the same quarter last year. And ongoing EBITDA of Spectra Energy was $634 million, down $70 million from the prior year quarter. Spectra Energy's ongoing results exclude special items of $26 million, all at DCP, and primarily from the gain on sale of an asset. 
Turning to the drivers of our ongoing results by segment. Let's start with Spectra Energy Partners, where EBITDA was up approximately 16% quarter-over-quarter. SEP consists of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses, and is shown in the upper right-hand corner of Slide 3. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $401 million, up $49 million over last year. These quarterly EBITDA results reflect increased earnings at U.S. Transmission and are attributable to expansion projects placed into service in the prior year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, as well as those placed into full or partial service in the third quarter of this year, Uniontown to Gas City and OPEN, respectively. Both of these projects came into service earlier than expected, building on our lengthening record of excellence and execution. Our base business continues to perform well, and I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a renewal rate of about 98% of our contracted revenue on the U.S. natural gas pipelines, which is an indication of the value of our underlying base business. 
The Liquids business reported third quarter EBITDA of $79 million, compared with $60 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement is attributable mainly to higher transportation revenues due to increased tariff rates and volumes on the Express pipeline. 
Let's move now to our Canadian business segments, which are shown on the left-hand side of the slide. While our 3-year plan anticipated a lower Canadian dollar in 2015 compared to 2014, for the quarter, the Canadian dollar was 14% weaker than our planned and assumed. As a result, the FX effect on EBITDA for our Canadian business segments this quarter compared to the same quarter last year was $14 million at Distribution and $24 million at Western Canada or $38 million in total. As a reminder, about 2/3 of our currency exposure is naturally hedged at the net income level on an annual basis. For the quarter, the reduction in net income from controlling interest related to FX was $18 million.
Distribution reported third quarter EBITDA of $70 million, compared with $82 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was driven by the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. The base business remained strong. And excluding the effect of FX, Distribution would have reported EBITDA that was higher quarter-over-quarter due to customer growth. 
Western Canada reported EBITDA of $117 million, compared with $156 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease quarter-over-quarter is due entirely to the effect of the lower Canadian dollar I mentioned previously, combined with lower earnings and interest. The risk management program implemented at Empress, including the hedges that we have in place, continues to support our view that Empress will generate cash of $30 million this year. 
Also, as a reminder, our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based, with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. We continue to monitor the current macro environment and producer activity in Western Canada as there have been slowdowns in some areas. We remain focused on continued prudent cost management to respond to the changing environment in Western Canada. 
Moving on to DCP. You'll recall that what we show here as Spectra Energy's EBITDA from Field Services actually represents our 50% share of DCP's earnings before income taxes plus gains from the DP unit issuances. Excluding the effect of special items, DCP's year-to-date EBITDA on a stand-alone basis is about $500 million, which is an indication of the strength of this business, even in the current market environment.
For the quarter, we reported ongoing EBITDA from Field Services at negative $29 million compared with $63 million last year. The 2015 period excludes special items of $26 million as previously mentioned. The 2014 period excludes special items of $12 million, mainly due to a goodwill impairment. 
The decrease in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by continued lower commodity prices and lower gains on DPM unit issuances. These decreases were partially offset by asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and other initiatives. We're pleased with all of the actions that have been taken to strengthen DCP, and Greg will speak more about that in a minute. 
So all in all, it was a solid quarter for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. Importantly, these results have us ahead of our expectations at this point in the year, and we expect to meet or exceed our full year plan and deliver on the significant financial commitments we made at the beginning of the year. 
Let's take a look at our distributable cash flow schedules, beginning with SEP as shown on our Slide 4. SEP's stand-alone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $270 million, an increase of $23 million over the prior year quarter. The higher DCF was attributable to the higher EBITDA I previously mentioned and reflects SEP's significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure. The quarterly and year-to-date results are consistent with our 2015 planned expectations to achieve full year coverage of 1.1x. SEP paid general and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $61 million and $148 million respectively. In addition, SEP continued to grow its distribution with its recently announced 32nd consecutive quarterly distribution increase. 
Turning to Slide 5. Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow is $223 million for the quarter compared with $236 million last year. The lower DCF is primarily attributable to receiving no distributions from DCP this quarter versus $43 million last year. Both quarterly and year-to-date results for DCF are consistent with our plan to achieve full year distribution coverage of 1.2x. 
SEP's ATM program continues to attract investor interest. And as a result, we don't anticipate accessing the equity markets through any vehicle other than our ATM program for the remainder of this year. For the year-to-date, SEP has raised $450 million through its ATM. We also have significant liquidity available across the company, totaling $3.4 billion as of September 30th. This financial flexibility gives us confidence in our continued capacity to successfully fund our growth projects in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
We know that investors are interested in the credit quality of our customers. So I want to mention that 90% of our revenues are contracted with customers who are investment grade or are secured by investment grade equivalents, like letters of credit.
Overall, our base businesses continued to perform well, generating stable and sustainable earnings and cash flow; our financial results are ahead of our expectations, even with commodity and FX headwinds; and we have the financial flexibility to fund our growth projects efficiently while staying on track to meet or exceed our 2015 EBITDA and DCF objectives. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $0.14 annual dividend increase guidance we shared with you earlier this year.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you've just heard, we achieved another solid quarter from both a financial and execution perspective. The results we delivered this quarter continue to underscore the strength and resilience of our portfolio of businesses.
SEP has no commodity and virtually no volume exposure and Spectra Energy's exposure to commodity is limited to 1% of our forecasted EBITDA. In the current environment, this limited commodity and volume exposure, coupled with our track record of consistently doing what we say we'll do, are important risk differentiators for us versus many others in the midstream space. Our focus continues to be on operating our business safely and reliably and delivering on our growth and dividend promises for investors, in both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. 
You've previously seen this slide outlining our priorities. So let me provide an update on our progress. First, we're very pleased that the recent transactions initiated by Spectra Energy and Phillips 66 to strengthen DCP are complete, with the transactions closing on October 30th As we've said previously, the contributions made by the owners, along with the other initiatives underway at DCP, established a foundation for sustainable cash flows at DCP Midstream over the longer run.
DCP quickly adjusted to the rapidly changing industry environment and continues to be extremely diligent in taking actions of its own to insure its longer-term success. Over the past year, DCP has engaged in various self-help initiatives, including the sale of $200 million of noncore or underperforming assets, reducing base costs by approximately $70 million and launching the restructuring of its commodity-sensitive contracts, which, combined with hedging, will decrease fee-based earnings.
As an example, you may have seen the recent announcement of a 10-year renewal of contract with one of the largest investment-grade independent producers in the Permian. This new contract has been converted at significantly better margins from a percent of proceeds to 100% fee-based and covers approximately 1 million dedicated acres. DCP is on track, if not slightly ahead, of where they need to be to achieve their contract conversion goal of reducing 1/3 of its commodity-exposed NGL length by the end of 2017.
With the support provided by the owners and DCP's own initiatives, it's our view that DCP has the ability to realize breakeven cash flows and make ongoing positive economic contribution to the owners at current commodity prices, while remaining well positioned to further benefit from industry recovery. This turnaround is significant and a direct reflection of all the actions taken to strengthen this must-run business. 
Next, completing our secured backlog and doing so on time and on budget continues to be key to our execution advantage. We also remain diligent in advancing and securing projects in development to ensure we deliver on our growth objectives. Finally, we continue to believe there will be industry consolidation opportunities and that could advance our value creation objectives and complement our business profile. 
With that, let me update you on the projects we have in execution. You've seen this slide many times before, and it's a great scorecard to track the success that we've had so far in executing on our growth plans. Not only are we consistently demonstrating that our project development time lines and budgets are reliable but also that we're able to realize some upside from placing projects into service early. Our Uniontown to Gas City project began delivering gas to the Midwest on August 1st and was fully in-service September 1, 2 full months ahead of the schedule.
Additionally, the first segment of OPEN was also put into service about 6 weeks ahead of schedule, and the remaining portion of OPEN has a November in-service date. We're very proud of the track record on project execution and pleased with the growth that these projects offer our investors. Since our last earnings call, we've moved $1.4 billion of expansion projects into service. And by year-end, that number will be almost $1.9 billion as we will place the 2015 Dawn-Parkway project fully into service, consistent with the originally planned in-service date. 
In aggregate, the expansion projects that will be placed into service this year, excluding those at DCP, will generate $135 million of EBITDA annually. These projects are fee-based, with no commodity or volume exposure, further adding to the stability of Spectra Energy's and Spectra Energy Partners' earnings and cash flows. 
Overall, 2015 will be a successful year for delivering projects into service and demonstrating our project execution advantage. Looking forward, our project backlog has almost $9 billion of projects still to be placed into service. As a reminder, all of these projects are underpinned by executed customer agreements. You'll also notice that about 75% of our expansion CapEx in execution is supported by secure contracts with demand-pull customers, such as gas -- local gas distribution companies, further demonstrating the strength of our current project backlog in this environment. 
All of our projects in execution are proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. Here's an indication of the great progress we've been making since our last earnings call. We have filed FERC regulatory applications for several U.S. projects: Atlantic Bridge, PennEast, Access South, Adair Southwest and the Lebanon Extension. In Western Canada, the Jackfish Lake, RAM and High Pine projects have either already been filed or will be filed this month with the National Energy Board. These projects represent about $1 billion of low-risk cost of service pipeline expansions. 
In addition, construction is underway on AIM, the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project and the Express Enhancement project, and we are on track to begin construction on Sabal Trail next year. A significant milestone will be met on NEXUS later this month when the project files its FERC application. 
Let's take a closer look at NEXUS and the progress we're making on that particular project. Many of your are familiar with NEXUS, but I want to take this opportunity to remind you of the scope of the project that we are jointly developing with DTE. The NEXUS project is a 250-mile 1.5 Bcf a day pipeline that will originate at Kensington, Ohio, and connect with DTE Gas in Michigan. This path will utilize TETCO, DTE gas and Vector Pipeline. The project represents tremendous opportunities for customers to access gas from both the Utica and Marcellus and move it through markets in Ohio and Michigan to the 150 Bcf a day Dawn storage hub, the second largest physical trading gas hub in North America and which is owned and operated by our own Union Gas. 
NEXUS is a key strategic project for us as it will ultimately connect Texas Eastern with the Union Gas system, something we've been envisioning for our customers for many years. To complete the upstream path of NEXUS, we're advancing the TEO project, an expansion of TETCO, to offer customers greater supply axis and market connectivity by transporting gas on Texas Eastern to Kensington, Ohio.
We'll be filing our FERC application for TEO later this month. As you know, downstream for NEXUS are the Union Gas' $1.5 billion Dawn to Parkway expansions, which provide customers in Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S. access to supply directly at the Dawn Hub and the capacity to move their gas to downstream markets. And as I mentioned earlier, the first phase of the Union Dawn -- Union Gas Dawn-Parkway expansion projects will be completed later this year.
NEXUS is moving forward with the support from executing customer agreements with LDCs to demand-pull markets as well as Marcellus and Utica producers. We've also recently find a number of interconnect agreements with industrial facilities and power generators that could connect incremental load across Northern Ohio with up to 1.4 Bcf a day. Importantly, this demonstrates strong long-term market support for our route and the project, and we continue to see increased production forecast for the Appalachian region.
We've achieved several milestones in NEXUS this year, including the January approval by FERC to use the prefiling review process, selection of an EPCM contractor and securing pipe for the project. And as mentioned, NEXUS will file its FERC application later this month, and we would expect FERC to issue its approval to proceed in the second half of '16, thereby allowing us to achieve our in-service date of late 2017. 
So we're pleased with the progress we're making on NEXUS as well as the progress we continue to make on all of our projects in execution. When this backlog of projects is in service along with the others we'll place into service this year, investors can expect these projects to generate about $1 billion of EBITDA by 2020. 
Let's now shift our focus to projects in development. In addition to our backlog of projects in execution, we've got a robust portfolio of opportunities in development that will lead to continued growth in 2018 and beyond, and we're working diligently towards advancing those projects. We continue to make progress on our Access Northeast project, which is an expansion of our Algonquin system to serve the New England power generation markets and address electric reliability concerns during peak periods. 
This reliability is becoming a more critical concern each year as additional coal, oil and nuclear plants announce retirements. Key to Access Northeast is recognizing the importance of being directly connected to 60% of New England's gas-fired electric generators.
Gas deliveries to electric generators can only be guaranteed for those with the last mile firm transportation contracts. Electric generators without last mile firm transportation contracts have no guarantees of gas deliveries on peak demand days, regardless of firm contracts may have on other pipelines. Access Northeast will largely solve this issue.
Earlier this week, we filed with FERC to use the prefiling review process for this project. At the state level, we are at a positive turning point to support for our approach and for the electric distribution companies to secure capacity continues to build with a series of separate but very consistent actions across the different states. 
Rhode Island's Affordable Clean Energy Security Act of 2014 authorizes the division of public utilities and carriers and the Office of Energy Resources to develop an issue open and competitive solicitations for infrastructure projects in clean energy resources. Last month, in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities confirmed its legal authority to review and approve EDC contracts to enhance electric reliability and reduce energy costs.
The main PUC's ongoing proceedings has recognized the benefits of examining a regional electrical lability solution for main customers. Connecticut continues to make progress toward their RFP, focused on ensuring electric reliability as outlined in legislation passed this summer. And in New Hampshire, the PUC staff has issued a report supporting the legal authority for EDCs to enter into gas pipeline capacity contracts.
We've made significant progress since the region's governors came together around the reliability challenge they identified in 2013. We're optimistic that before the year is over, some of the electric distribution companies will be filing contracts for state approval. As a result, with all this positive momentum, we're now even more confident in our ability to move Access Northeast into execution in the first half of 2016. 
We continue to actively pursue many other projects in development and have ongoing productive discussions with potential customers. Interest remains strong in many of these projects, particularly those that are demand-pull. Supply-push discussions are proceeding at a slower pace in the current market environment. However, we remain highly confident that this infrastructure is needed and will ultimately be secured by the end of the decade. We will continue to actively engage with the market as the energy environment evolves and aggressively pursue the other projects in development.
Two years ago, our Drive to 35 originated from our expectation that we have the ability to secure contracts and pursue organic growth projects totaling $35 billion. To-date, we've been very successful on our efforts with almost $10 billion in-service and delivering cash and almost $9 billion remaining in our secured project execution backlog, which will add incremental cash flow beyond the current period.
We will continue to focus our efforts on organic growth since it's the most economically attractive way to grow, albeit often at a slower pace. We're not dependent on M&A to achieve our Drive to 35. However, the current environment may provide good opportunities to participate in industry consolidation, which could, in fact, expedite our efforts to achieve that goal. 
So we continue to deliver solid results, further proof of the resiliency of our underlying businesses and continued demonstration of our execution advantage. As I mentioned last quarter, not only do we believe that investors are beginning to differentiate between investment options in this environment but also that Spectra Energy and SEP offer best-in-class investment opportunities. Spectra Energy Partners is one of the lowest-risk MLP investments available, offering investors visible growth. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years, and these are reservation-based contracts.
An Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, revenues are our reservation-based with no commodity exposure and virtually no volume exposure, allowing us to provide quarterly distribution growth for our investors every quarter for the last 8 years. And we're committed to continuing that track record with 8% to 9% annual growth. Simply put, SEP is the most prudent, steady large pipeline MLP in existence today.
Spectra Energy offers an unrivaled footprint that connects all of the major North American supply basins with demand markets a first and last mile advantage. With more than 1/2 its EBITDA coming from SEP's stable and reliable earnings, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for 2015 to '17 period will come from our fee-based businesses. And there's virtually no further commodity downside to our DCF forecast if commodity prices move slower. As such, we remain committed to growing Spectra Energy's annual dividend by $0.14 per share through 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our impressive backlog of secured growth projects and pursuing new opportunities. We get two strong currencies for Spectra Energy shares and Spectra Energy Partners. Both companies have investment-grade balance sheets, which we're committed to, and we are disciplined in our financial management. So those are the attributes we believe differentiates Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners from other energy companies and why we believe so strongly that both our companies offer best-in-class low-risk investment opportunities today.
With that, let me turn things over to Julie so that we can take your questions."

I think what you're seeing is starting to see some real differentiation. I just look at SEP equity, for example. In the last 12 months, SEP equity, I don't think it should have but it backed up the yield maybe 100, 125 basis points, but you see a lot of others moving 200, 300, 400, 500, even 600 basis points on their yield. I think that's going to make it very tough for some of those people to be able to execute on some of their plans. And so I think that could create some opportunity for us. Obviously, I think part of our interest is on the liquid side. Marley's open to gas. That's our base business. So I don't think the delta between the bid and ask has come down entirely yet. But again, as each quarter goes on and people see the strength of those people with pipeline assets like we have that have very steady, reliable and have committed to 8%, 9% type growth, that's going to be rewarded versus some folks who had maybe much loftier suggestions that people are going to realize in this environment that's not possible. So I think you're going to see strength to go to people of size and strength to go to people of low volatility. And I think that's advantage for both Spectra and Spectra Energy Partners."

But obviously, people will pay a lot to move product anywhere at this point in time, and you're obviously, attracting that flow rate for a relatively small incremental capital.

And we are seeing some benefits on the steel front, I'd even say on turbines and things like that. But important to remember that the breakdown's about 70-30 for capital in terms of 30% is hard assets, if you will. 70% is labor and regulatory and land. And Faisel, we're not seeing in any pullback in costs on those fronts. People are building projects in highly concentrated areas. As we all know, regulatory processes don't get any easier. Land issues, labor is tight in those locations. You can move steel from one part of the continent to the opposite side, but you can't move people that way, right? So I think the savings because of our relatively weak energy environment are not really showing up in full pipeline construction. You're getting some benefits on hard product, but again, most of the costs are on the other side. So we feel good about our estimates, but I don't see us seeing big cost savings in this environment."

Today, that's less than 30%. And the biggest chunk of margin comes from gas and NGL fee margins. And that's a substantial change in a year, and we've even seen about a 20% increase in the margins realized on gas processing on a fee basis. So I think between -- and we're still early days of the contract discussions. But I think as Wouter outlined for investors in February at our conference, that was something we got on very early.

Lastly, this is just kind of a macro question, not necessarily about your assets but maybe just Marcellus build out in general. We're seeing some massive dry Utica wells. And if this continues, I would think natural gas prices stay lower for longer, possibly pricing out some producers who might not have that exposure. So maybe it becomes less producers each with more market share now. I would think some of the producers are not going to make it, especially given leverage and balance sheet issues. At what point should we be worried about some of the counterparties on all the pipelines that are currently being developed to get out of the region? I understand a lot of your build-out is underpinned by utilities, but there is an element of supply-push out of the region. So I would be curious as to your thoughts and maybe some insight into the landscape out there. Are there outs for some of these producers, if the pipeline hasn't broken ground yet?"

Again, as you point out, 75% of our execution -- projects in execution are demand-pull. And low prices producers don't like it, but the demand side sure loves it. So that's a positive side of it. And as Pat said, 90% of our customers are investment grade or secured. I think if you looked at the U.S. side of things or the top 10 customers, which are investment grade except for one, would account for 50% of the revenue that we have. And in Canada, the same type of thing and all of those top 10, which account for 50% of revenue, would be investment grade. So feel pretty good where we are, but I think next spring is the time to kind of watch things. But I would also say just like we see at DCP in our places, and you've seen what the variety of producers talking about it this week and last week, but they're ripping out costs straight, left and center and so you're seeing some pretty dramatic drops in what you wouldn't have thought was possible a year ago is.

So you're talking about probably the pipeline that's delivering to until recently the most expensive place to get gas now that's New England. And two, the big backers of that pipeline, Statoil and Chesapeake. But -- so you can say, okay, well, Statoil very solid. Chesapeake is not investment grade today. But where they are delivering that gas is absolutely probably the most profitable piece of capacity that they own. So I think you can't look at it just who's the backing book, but where is it going. And if you do not have first mile and last mile advantage, even if you've got contracts, I think you can have some challenges with your supply-push producers. If you've got that last mile advantage, that's going to be the most important project and our capacity that they will hold. So I don't think you can look at it just solely on who's back in the project. Where is it going? And where it is going? Is that a demand market -- a premium demand market? That's the real value that suppliers -- supply-push players will look for even in a down market."

And so as we look pro forma on the effect that SEP is neutral and, of course, that had to be the case to get the special committee to sign off on it. So don't see any pressure at all on SEP. If anything, it's perhaps slightly positive as we modeled it. So I don't think it changes at all the credit profile at SEP or how we'll fund growth there for the U.S. portion of our CapEx. At SE in consolidation, there is a small reduction, obviously, from the surrender of units and the GP get back. But given where we are in the IDRs, it's not the full amount of the EBITDA that was transferred to DCP. And ironically, given the strong benefit to DCP of what we did and what our partner did matching with cash, I believe, we'll be in a situation to see cash distributions resume at DCP much earlier than they might have otherwise, in which case we'll get half back, if you think about it that way, of the contribution that we made. So net-net, for a company up top that has $3 billion of EBITDA, very small impact and no effect on SE's outlook for capital or credit."

Interest expense is staying lower and longer. That's obviously, positive. And frankly, we've done better from a maintenance capital perspective moving some stuff into '15 and that's obviously going to help us because maintenance programs typically be multiyear projects in many respects and so moving some stuff into '15 given the results we have actually are helpful in '16, '17.

Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio",1285,"Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio, which is structured to moderate the effects of various business cycles and preserve the upside benefits in the recovery phase. Spectra Energy Partners' EBITDA for the quarter was $467 million, $66 million higher than the same quarter last year. And ongoing EBITDA of Spectra Energy was $634 million, down $70 million from the prior year quarter. Spectra Energy's ongoing results exclude special items of $26 million, all at DCP, and primarily from the gain on sale of an asset. 
Turning to the drivers of our ongoing results by segment. Let's start with Spectra Energy Partners, where EBITDA was up approximately 16% quarter-over-quarter. SEP consists of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses, and is shown in the upper right-hand corner of Slide 3. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $401 million, up $49 million over last year. These quarterly EBITDA results reflect increased earnings at U.S. Transmission and are attributable to expansion projects placed into service in the prior year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, as well as those placed into full or partial service in the third quarter of this year, Uniontown to Gas City and OPEN, respectively. Both of these projects came into service earlier than expected, building on our lengthening record of excellence and execution. Our base business continues to perform well, and I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a renewal rate of about 98% of our contracted revenue on the U.S. natural gas pipelines, which is an indication of the value of our underlying base business. 
The Liquids business reported third quarter EBITDA of $79 million, compared with $60 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement is attributable mainly to higher transportation revenues due to increased tariff rates and volumes on the Express pipeline. 
Let's move now to our Canadian business segments, which are shown on the left-hand side of the slide. While our 3-year plan anticipated a lower Canadian dollar in 2015 compared to 2014, for the quarter, the Canadian dollar was 14% weaker than our plan had assumed. As a result, the FX effect on EBITDA for our Canadian business segments this quarter compared to the same quarter of last year was $14 million at Distribution and $24 million at Western Canada or $38 million in total. As a reminder, about 2/3 of our currency exposure is naturally hedged at the net income level on an annual basis. For the quarter, the reduction in net income from controlling interest related to FX was $18 million.
Distribution reported third quarter EBITDA of $70 million, compared with $82 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was driven by the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. The base business remained strong. And excluding the effect of FX, Distribution would have reported EBITDA that was higher quarter-over-quarter due to customer growth. 
Western Canada reported EBITDA of $117 million, compared with $156 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease quarter-over-quarter is due entirely to the effect of the lower Canadian dollar I mentioned previously, combined with lower earnings at Empress. The risk management program implemented at Empress, including the hedges that we have in place, continues to support our view that Empress will generate cash of $30 million this year. 
Also, as a reminder, our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based, with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. We continue to monitor the current macro environment and producer activity in Western Canada as there have been slowdowns in some areas. We remain focused on continued prudent cost management to respond to the changing environment in Western Canada. 
Moving on to DCP. You'll recall that what we show here as Spectra Energy's EBITDA from Field Services actually represents our 50% share of DCP's earnings before income taxes plus gains from the DP unit issuances. Excluding the effect of special items, DCP's year-to-date EBITDA on a stand-alone basis is about $500 million, which is an indication of the strength of this business, even in the current market environment.
For the quarter, we reported ongoing EBITDA from Field Services at negative $29 million compared with $63 million last year. The 2015 period excludes special items of $26 million as previously mentioned. The 2014 period excludes special items of $12 million, mainly due to a goodwill impairment. 
The decrease in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by continued lower commodity prices and lower gains on DPM unit issuances. These decreases were partially offset by asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and other initiatives. We're pleased with all of the actions that have been taken to strengthen DCP, and Greg will speak more about that in a minute. 
So all in all, it was a solid quarter for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. Importantly, these results have us ahead of our expectations at this point in the year, and we expect to meet or exceed our full year plan and deliver on the significant financial commitments we made at the beginning of the year. 
Let's take a look at our distributable cash flow schedules, beginning with SEP as shown on our Slide 4. SEP's stand-alone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $270 million, an increase of $23 million over the prior year quarter. The higher DCF was attributable to the higher EBITDA I previously mentioned and reflects SEP's significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure. The quarterly and year-to-date results are consistent with our 2015 planned expectations to achieve full year coverage of 1.1x. SEP paid general and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $61 million and $148 million respectively. In addition, SEP continued to grow its distribution with its recently announced 32nd consecutive quarterly distribution increase. 
Turning to Slide 5. Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow is $223 million for the quarter compared with $236 million last year. The lower DCF is primarily attributable to receiving no distributions from DCP this quarter versus $43 million last year. Both quarterly and year-to-date results for DCF are consistent with our plan to achieve full year distribution coverage of 1.2x. 
SEP's ATM program continues to attract investor interest. And as a result, we don't anticipate accessing the equity markets through any vehicle other than our ATM program for the remainder of this year. For the year-to-date, SEP has raised $450 million through its ATM. We also have significant liquidity available across the company, totaling $3.4 billion as of September 30. This financial flexibility gives us confidence in our continued capacity to successfully fund our growth projects in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
We know that investors are interested in the credit quality of our customers. So I want to mention that 90% of our revenues are contracted with customers who are investment grade or are secured by investment grade equivalents, like letters of credit.
Overall, our base businesses continued to perform well, generating stable and sustainable earnings and cash flow; our financial results are ahead of our expectations, even with commodity and FX headwinds; and we have the financial flexibility to fund our growth projects efficiently while staying on track to meet or exceed our 2015 EBITDA and DCF objectives. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $0.14 annual dividend increase guidance we shared with you earlier this year.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you've just heard, we achieved another solid quarter from both a financial and execution perspective. The results we delivered this quarter continue to underscore the strength and resilience of our portfolio of businesses.
SEP has no commodity and virtually no volume exposure and Spectra Energy's exposure to commodity is limited to 1% of our forecasted EBITDA. In the current environment, this limited commodity and volume exposure, coupled with our track record of consistently doing what we say we'll do, are important risk differentiators for us versus many others in the midstream space. Our focus continues to be on operating our business safely and reliably and delivering on our growth and dividend promises for investors, in both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. 
You've previously seen this slide outlining our priorities. So let me provide an update on our progress. First, we're very pleased that the recent transactions initiated by Spectra Energy and Phillips 66 to strengthen DCP are complete, with the transactions closing on October 30th As we've said previously, the contributions made by the owners, along with the other initiatives underway at DCP, established a foundation for sustainable cash flows at DCP Midstream over the longer run.
DCP quickly adjusted to the rapidly changing industry environment and continues to be extremely diligent in taking actions of its own to ensure its longer-term success. Over the past year, DCP has engaged in various self-help initiatives, including the sale of $200 million of noncore or underperforming assets, reducing base costs by approximately $70 million and launching the restructuring of its commodity-sensitive contracts, which, combined with hedging, will decrease fee-based earnings.
As an example, you may have seen the recent announcement of a 10-year renewal of contract with one of the largest investment-grade independent producers in the Permian. This new contract has been converted at significantly better margins from a percent of proceeds to 100% fee-based and covers approximately 1 million dedicated acres. DCP is on track, if not slightly ahead, of where they need to be to achieve their contract conversion goal of reducing 1/3 of its commodity-exposed NGL length by the end of 2017.
With the support provided by the owners and DCP's own initiatives, it's our view that DCP has the ability to realize breakeven cash flows and make ongoing positive economic contribution to the owners at current commodity prices, while remaining well positioned to further benefit from industry recovery. This turnaround is significant and a direct reflection of all the actions taken to strengthen this must-run business. 
Next, completing our secured backlog and doing so on time and on budget continues to be key to our execution advantage. We also remain diligent in advancing and securing projects in development to ensure we deliver on our growth objectives. Finally, we continue to believe there will be industry consolidation opportunities and that could advance our value creation objectives and complement our business profile. 
With that, let me update you on the projects we have in execution. You've seen this slide many times before, and it's a great scorecard to track the success that we've had so far in executing on our growth plans. Not only are we consistently demonstrating that our project development time lines and budgets are reliable but also that we're able to realize some upside from placing projects into service early. Our Uniontown to Gas City project began delivering gas to the Midwest on August 1 and was fully in-service September 1, 2 full months ahead of the schedule.
Additionally, the first segment of OPEN was also put into service about 6 weeks ahead of schedule, and the remaining portion of OPEN has a November in-service date. We're very proud of the track record on project execution and pleased with the growth that these projects offer our investors. Since our last earnings call, we've moved $1.4 billion of expansion projects into service. And by year-end, that number will be almost $1.9 billion as we will place the 2015 Dawn-Parkway project fully into service, consistent with the originally planned in-service date. 
In aggregate, the expansion projects that will be placed into service this year, excluding those at DCP, will generate $135 million of EBITDA annually. These projects are fee-based, with no commodity or volume exposure, further adding to the stability of Spectra Energy's and Spectra Energy Partners' earnings and cash flows. 
Overall, 2015 will be a successful year for delivering projects into service and demonstrating our project execution advantage. Looking forward, our project backlog has almost $9 billion of projects still to be placed into service. As a reminder, all of these projects are underpinned by executed customer agreements. You'll also notice that about 75% of our expansion CapEx in execution is supported by secure contracts with demand-pull customers, such as gas -- local gas distribution companies, further demonstrating the strength of our current project backlog in this environment. 
All of our projects in execution are proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. And here's an indication of the great progress we've been making since our last earnings call. We have filed FERC regulatory applications for several U.S. projects: Atlantic Bridge, PennEast, Access South, Adair Southwest and the Lebanon Extension. In Western Canada, the Jackfish Lake, RAM and High Pine projects have either already been filed or will be filed this month with the National Energy Board. These projects represent about $1 billion of low-risk cost of service pipeline expansions. 
In addition, construction is underway on AIM, the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project and the Express Enhancement project, and we are on track to begin construction on Sabal Trail next year. A significant milestone will be met on NEXUS later this month when the project files its FERC application. 
Let's take a closer look at NEXUS and the progress we're making on that particular project. Many of you are familiar with NEXUS, but I want to take this opportunity to remind you of the scope of the project that we are jointly developing with DTE. The NEXUS project is a 250-mile 1.5 Bcf a day pipeline that will originate at Kensington, Ohio, and connect with DTE Gas in Michigan. This path will utilize TETCO, DTE gas and Vector Pipelines. The project represents tremendous opportunities for customers to access gas from both the Utica and Marcellus and move it through markets in Ohio and Michigan to the 150 Bcf a day Dawn storage hub, the second largest physical trading gas hub in North America and which is owned and operated by our own Union Gas. 
NEXUS is a key strategic project for us as it will ultimately connect Texas Eastern with the Union Gas system, something we've been envisioning for our customers for many years. To complete the upstream path of NEXUS, we're advancing the TEO project, an expansion of TETCO, to offer customers greater supply axis and market connectivity by transporting gas on Texas Eastern to Kensington, Ohio.
We'll be filing our FERC application for TEO later this month. As you know, downstream for NEXUS are the Union Gas' $1.5 billion Dawn to Parkway expansions, which provide customers in Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S. access to supply directly at the Dawn Hub and the capacity to move their gas to downstream markets. And as I mentioned earlier, the first phase of the Union Dawn -- Union Gas Dawn-Parkway expansion projects will be completed later this year.
NEXUS is moving forward with the support from executing customer agreements with LDCs to demand-pull markets as well as Marcellus and Utica producers. We've also recently signed a number of interconnect agreements with industrial facilities and power generators that could connect incremental load across Northern Ohio of up to 1.4 Bcf a day. Importantly, this demonstrates strong long-term market support for our route and the project, and we continue to see increased production forecast for the Appalachian region.
We've achieved several milestones in NEXUS this year, including the January approval by FERC to use the prefiling review process, selection of an EPCM contractor and securing pipe for the project. And as mentioned, NEXUS will file its FERC application later this month, and we would expect FERC to issue its approval to proceed in the second half of '16, thereby allowing us to achieve our in-service date of late 2017. 
So we're pleased with the progress we're making on NEXUS as well as the progress we continue to make on all of our projects in execution. When this backlog of projects is in service along with the others we'll place into service this year, investors can expect these projects to generate about $1 billion of EBITDA by 2020. 
Let's now shift our focus to projects in development. In addition to our backlog of projects in execution, we've got a robust portfolio of opportunities in development that will lead to continued growth in 2018 and beyond, and we're working diligently towards advancing those projects. We continue to make progress on our Access Northeast project, which is an expansion of our Algonquin system to serve the New England power generation markets and address electric reliability concerns during peak periods. 
This reliability is becoming a more critical concern each year as additional coal, oil and nuclear plants announce retirements. Key to Access Northeast is recognizing the importance of being directly connected to 60% of New England's gas-fired electric generators.
Gas deliveries to electric generators can only be guaranteed for those with the last mile firm transportation contracts. Electric generators without last mile firm transportation contracts have no guarantees of gas deliveries on peak demand days, regardless of firm contracts they may have on other pipelines. Access Northeast will largely solve this issue.
Earlier this week, we filed with FERC to use the prefiling review process for this project. At the state level, we are at a positive turning point to support for our approach and for the electric distribution companies to secure capacity continues to build with a series of separate but very consistent actions across the different states. 
Rhode Island's Affordable Clean Energy Security Act of 2014 authorizes the division of public utilities and carriers and the Office of Energy Resources to develop and issue open and competitive solicitations for infrastructure projects and clean energy resources. Last month, in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities confirmed its legal authority to review and approve EDC contracts to enhance electric reliability and reduce energy costs.
The main PUC's ongoing proceedings has recognized the benefits of examining a regional electrical reliability solution for main customers. Connecticut continues to make progress toward their RFP, focused on ensuring electric reliability as outlined in legislation passed this summer. And in New Hampshire, the PUC staff has issued a report supporting the legal authority for EDCs to enter into gas pipeline capacity contracts.
We've made significant progress since the region's governors came together around the reliability challenge they identified in 2013. We're optimistic that before the year is over, some of the electric distribution companies will be filing contracts for state approval. As a result, with all this positive momentum, we're now even more confident in our ability to move Access Northeast into execution in the first half of 2016. 
We continue to actively pursue many other projects in development and have ongoing productive discussions with potential customers. Interest remains strong in many of these projects, particularly those that are demand-pull. Supply-push discussions are proceeding at a slower pace in the current market environment. However, we remain highly confident that this infrastructure is needed and will ultimately be secured by the end of the decade. We will continue to actively engage with the market as the energy environment evolves and aggressively pursue the other projects in development.
Two years ago, our Drive to 35 originated from our expectation that we have the ability to secure contracts and pursue organic growth projects totaling $35 billion. To-date, we've been very successful on our efforts with almost $10 billion in-service and delivering cash and almost $9 billion remaining in our secured project execution backlog, which will add incremental cash flow beyond the current period.
We will continue to focus our efforts on organic growth since it's the most economically attractive way to grow, albeit often at a slower pace. We're not dependent on M&A to achieve our Drive to 35. However, the current environment may provide good opportunities to participate in industry consolidation, which could, in fact, expedite our efforts to achieve that goal. 
So we continue to deliver solid results, further proof of the resiliency of our underlying businesses and continued demonstration of our execution advantage. As I mentioned last quarter, not only do we believe that investors are beginning to differentiate between investment options in this environment but also that Spectra Energy and SEP offer best-in-class investment opportunities. Spectra Energy Partners is one of the lowest-risk MLP investments available, offering investors visible growth. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years, and these are reservation-based contracts.
An Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, revenues are our reservation-based with no commodity exposure and virtually no volume exposure, allowing us to provide quarterly distribution growth for our investors every quarter for the last 8 years. And we're committed to continuing that track record with 8% to 9% annual growth. Simply put, SEP is the most prudent, steady large pipeline MLP in existence today.
Spectra Energy offers an unrivaled footprint that connects all of the major North American supply basins with demand markets, a first and last mile advantage. With more than 1/2 its EBITDA coming from SEP's stable and reliable earnings, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for 2015 to '17 period will come from our fee-based businesses. And there's virtually no further commodity downside to our DCF forecast if commodity prices move slower. As such, we remain committed to growing Spectra Energy's annual dividend by $0.14 per share through 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our impressive backlog of secured growth projects and pursuing new opportunities. We get two strong currencies for Spectra Energy shares and Spectra Energy Partners. Both companies have investment-grade balance sheets, which we're committed to, and we are disciplined in our financial management. So those are the attributes we believe differentiates Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners from other energy companies and why we believe so strongly that both our companies offer best-in-class low-risk investment opportunities today.
With that, let me turn things over to Julie so that we can take your questions."

I think what you're seeing is starting to see some real differentiation. I just look at SEP equity, for example. In the last 12 months, SEP equity, I don't think it should have but it backed up the yield maybe 100, 125 basis points, but you see a lot of others moving 200, 300, 400, 500, even 600 basis points on their yield. I think that's going to make it very tough for some of those people to be able to execute on some of their plans. And so I think that could create some opportunity for us. Obviously, I think part of our interest is on the liquid side. Marley's [ph] open to gas. That's our base business. So I don't think the delta between the bid and ask has come down entirely yet. But again, as each quarter goes on and people see the strength of those people with pipeline assets like we have that have very steady, reliable and have committed to 8%, 9% type growth, that's going to be rewarded versus some folks who had maybe much loftier suggestions that people are going to realize in this environment that's not possible. So I think you're going to see strength to go to people of size and strength to go to people of low volatility. And I think that's advantage for both Spectra and Spectra Energy Partners."

But there are some unique regulatory aspects to it. But probably the biggest one that we've first had to get over was the fact of the legality, if you will, of EDC's holding pipeline capacity. I think in the last several months, that's largely been put to bed. And so that was a critical component. And now the other one, we'll just turn around getting contracts [indiscernible] regulators, which as I think we made in opening comments, we'd expect to see some of those folks do that before the end of the year."

But obviously, people will pay a lot to move product anywhere at this point in time, and you're obviously, attracting that flow rate for a relatively small incremental capital.

But by the next project, everybody has got the same competitive makeup. So it quickly dissipates. But that being said, we're taking advantage where we can on that front. And we are seeing some benefits on the steel front, I'd even say on turbines and things like that. But important to remember that the breakdown's about 70-30 for capital. In terms of 30% is hard assets, if you will. 70% is labor and regulatory and land. And Faisel, we're not seeing in any pullback in costs on those fronts. People are building projects in highly concentrated areas. As we all know, regulatory processes don't get any easier. Land issues, labor is tight in those locations. You can move steel from one part of the continent to the opposite side, but you can't move people that way, right? So I think the savings because of a relatively weak energy environment are not really showing up in full pipeline construction. You're getting some benefits on hard product, but again, most of the costs are on the other side. So we feel good about our estimates, but I don't see us seeing big cost savings in this environment."

Today, that's less than 30%. And the biggest chunk of margin comes from gas and NGL fee margins. And that's a substantial change in a year, and we've even seen about a 20% increase in the margins realized on gas processing on a fee basis.

Lastly, this is just kind of a macro question, not necessarily about your assets but maybe just Marcellus build out in general. We're seeing some massive dry Utica wells. And if this continues, I would think natural gas prices stay lower for longer, possibly pricing out some producers who might not have that exposure. So maybe it becomes less producers each with more market share now. I would think some of the producers are not going to make it, especially given leverage and balance sheet issues. At what point should we be worried about some of the counterparties on all the pipelines that are currently being developed to get out of the region? I understand a lot of your build-out is underpinned by utilities, but there is an element of supply-push out of the region. So I would be curious as to your thoughts and maybe some insight into the landscape out there. Are there outs for some of these producers, if the pipeline hasn't broken ground yet?"

Again, as you point out, 75% of our execution -- projects in execution are demand-pull. And low prices producers don't like it, but the demand side sure loves it. So that's a positive side of it. And as Pat said, 90% of our customers are investment grade or secured. I think if you looked at the U.S. side of things or the top 10 customers, which are investment grade except for one, would account for 50% of the revenue that we have. And in Canada, the same type of thing and all of those top 10, which account for 50% of revenue, would be investment grade. So feel pretty good where we are, but I think next spring is the time to kind of watch things. But I would also say just like we see at DCP in our places, and you've seen what the variety of producers talking about it this week and last week, but they're ripping out costs straight, left and center and so you're seeing some pretty dramatic drops in what you wouldn't have thought was possible a year ago is. So never underestimate the ability of necessity being the motherhood of invention here."

I think the issue would be -- so let's look at one realistically since it's already in service, which in retrospect I think maybe a good look. So let's look at New Jersey and New York. So you're talking about probably the pipeline that's delivering to, until recently, the most expensive place to get gas. Now that's New England. And two, the big backers of that pipeline, Statoil and Chesapeake. But -- so you can say, okay, well, Statoil very solid. Chesapeake is not investment grade today. But where they are delivering that gas is absolutely probably the most profitable piece of capacity that they own. So I think you can't look at it just who's the backing, but where is it going. And if you do not have first mile and last mile advantage, even if you've got contracts, I think you can have some challenges with your supply-push producers. If you've got that last mile advantage, that's going to be the most important project and/or capacity that they will hold. So I don't think you can look at it just solely on who's backing the project. Where is it going? And where it is going? Is that a demand market -- a premium demand market? That's the real value that suppliers -- supply-push players will look for even in a down market."

We have a giveback of -- a limited term giveback of our GP interest. And so as we look pro forma on the effect that SEP is neutral and, of course, that had to be the case to get the special committee to sign off on it. So don't see any pressure at all on SEP. If anything, it's perhaps slightly positive as we modeled it. So I don't think it changes at all the credit profile at SEP or how we'll fund growth there for the U.S. portion of our CapEx. At SE in consolidation, there is a small reduction, obviously, from the surrender of units and the GP giveback. But given where we are in the IDRs, it's not the full amount of the EBITDA that was transferred to DCP. And ironically, given the strong benefit to DCP of what we did and what our partner did matching with cash, I believe, we'll be in a situation to see cash distributions resume at DCP much earlier than they might have otherwise, in which case we'll get half back, if you think about it that way, of the contribution that we made. So net-net, for a company up top that has $3 billion of EBITDA, very small impact and no effect on SE's outlook for capital or credit."

SEP has added incremental projects and, therefore, results for EBITDA are going forward. Obviously, that comes to SE as well. So that's obviously, a positive from a credit perspective. Interest expense is staying lower and longer. That's obviously, positive. And frankly, we've done better from a maintenance capital perspective moving some stuff into '15 and that's obviously going to help us because maintenance programs typically would be multiyear projects in many respects and so moving some stuff into '15, given the results we have, actually are helpful in '16, '17.

That's not what we did. And those are going to be to tougher positions to find yourself in if you do not go to that last market. I think the supply push the producers are going to be looking for those types of contracts and saying, ""It's not really taking me to a premium market, do I need to re-up?

Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio",1285,"Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen in our news releases, both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio, which is structured to moderate the effects of various business cycles and preserve the upside benefits in the recovery phase. Spectra Energy Partners' EBITDA for the quarter was $467 million, $66 million higher than the same quarter last year. And ongoing EBITDA of Spectra Energy was $634 million, down $70 million from the prior year quarter. Spectra Energy's ongoing results exclude special items of $26 million, all at DCP, and primarily from the gain on sale of an asset. 
Turning to the drivers of our ongoing results by segment. Let's start with Spectra Energy Partners, where EBITDA was up approximately 16% quarter-over-quarter. SEP consists of our U.S. Transmission and Liquids businesses, and is shown in the upper right-hand corner of Slide 3. U.S. Transmission delivered EBITDA of $401 million, up $49 million over last year. These quarterly EBITDA results reflect increased earnings at U.S. Transmission and are attributable to expansion projects placed into service in the prior year, TEAM 2014 and TEAM South, as well as those placed into full or partial service in the third quarter of this year, Uniontown to Gas City and OPEN, respectively. Both of these projects came into service earlier than expected, building on our lengthening record of excellence and execution. Our base business continues to perform well, and I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a renewal rate of about 98% of our contracted revenue on the U.S. natural gas pipelines, which is an indication of the value of our underlying base business. 
The Liquids business reported third quarter EBITDA of $79 million, compared with $60 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement is attributable mainly to higher transportation revenues due to increased tariff rates and volumes on the Express pipeline. 
Let's move now to our Canadian business segments, which are shown on the left-hand side of the slide. While our 3-year plan anticipated a lower Canadian dollar in 2015 compared to 2014, for the quarter, the Canadian dollar was 14% weaker than our plan had assumed. As a result, the FX effect on EBITDA for our Canadian business segments this quarter compared to the same quarter of last year was $14 million at Distribution and $24 million at Western Canada or $38 million in total. As a reminder, about 2/3 of our currency exposure is naturally hedged at the net income level on an annual basis. For the quarter, the reduction in net income from controlling interest related to FX was $18 million.
Distribution reported third quarter EBITDA of $70 million, compared with $82 million in 2014. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was driven by the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. The base business remained strong. And excluding the effect of FX, Distribution would have reported EBITDA that was higher quarter-over-quarter due to customer growth. 
Western Canada reported EBITDA of $117 million, compared with $156 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease quarter-over-quarter is due entirely to the effect of the lower Canadian dollar I mentioned previously, combined with lower earnings at Empress. The risk management program implemented at Empress, including the hedges that we have in place, continues to support our view that Empress will generate cash of $30 million this year. 
Also, as a reminder, our Western Canadian business, including gathering and processing, is fee-based, with no direct commodity exposure or volume risk on existing contracts. We continue to monitor the current macro environment and producer activity in Western Canada as there have been slowdowns in some areas. We remain focused on continued prudent cost management to respond to the changing environment in Western Canada. 
Moving on to DCP. You'll recall that what we show here as Spectra Energy's EBITDA from Field Services actually represents our 50% share of DCP's earnings before income taxes plus gains from the DP unit issuances. Excluding the effect of special items, DCP's year-to-date EBITDA on a stand-alone basis is about $500 million, which is an indication of the strength of this business, even in the current market environment.
For the quarter, we reported ongoing EBITDA from Field Services at negative $29 million compared with $63 million last year. The 2015 period excludes special items of $26 million as previously mentioned. The 2014 period excludes special items of $12 million, mainly due to a goodwill impairment. 
The decrease in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by continued lower commodity prices and lower gains on DPM unit issuances. These decreases were partially offset by asset growth, improved operating efficiencies and other initiatives. We're pleased with all of the actions that have been taken to strengthen DCP, and Greg will speak more about that in a minute. 
So all in all, it was a solid quarter for both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. Importantly, these results have us ahead of our expectations at this point in the year, and we expect to meet or exceed our full year plan and deliver on the significant financial commitments we made at the beginning of the year. 
Let's take a look at our distributable cash flow schedules, beginning with SEP as shown on our Slide 4. SEP's stand-alone distributable cash flow for the quarter was $270 million, an increase of $23 million over the prior year quarter. The higher DCF was attributable to the higher EBITDA I previously mentioned and reflects SEP's significant organic growth, strong fee-based earnings and virtually no commodity or volume exposure. The quarterly and year-to-date results are consistent with our 2015 planned expectations to achieve full year coverage of 1.1x. SEP paid general and limited partner distributions to Spectra Energy for the quarter of $61 million and $148 million respectively. In addition, SEP continued to grow its distribution with its recently announced 32nd consecutive quarterly distribution increase. 
Turning to Slide 5. Spectra Energy's distributable cash flow is $223 million for the quarter compared with $236 million last year. The lower DCF is primarily attributable to receiving no distributions from DCP this quarter versus $43 million last year. Both quarterly and year-to-date results for DCF are consistent with our plan to achieve full year distribution coverage of 1.2x. 
SEP's ATM program continues to attract investor interest. And as a result, we don't anticipate accessing the equity markets through any vehicle other than our ATM program for the remainder of this year. For the year-to-date, SEP has raised $450 million through its ATM. We also have significant liquidity available across the company, totaling $3.4 billion as of September 30. This financial flexibility gives us confidence in our continued capacity to successfully fund our growth projects in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
We know that investors are interested in the credit quality of our customers. So I want to mention that 90% of our revenues are contracted with customers who are investment grade or are secured by investment grade equivalents, like letters of credit.
Overall, our base businesses continued to perform well, generating stable and sustainable earnings and cash flow; our financial results are ahead of our expectations, even with commodity and FX headwinds; and we have the financial flexibility to fund our growth projects efficiently while staying on track to meet or exceed our 2015 EBITDA and DCF objectives. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $0.14 annual dividend increase guidance we shared with you earlier this year.
So with that, let me turn things over to Greg to talk about our growth opportunities and the progress we're making on our Drive to 35."

As you've just heard, we achieved another solid quarter from both a financial and execution perspective. The results we delivered this quarter continue to underscore the strength and resilience of our portfolio of businesses.
SEP has no commodity and virtually no volume exposure and Spectra Energy's exposure to commodity is limited to 1% of our forecasted EBITDA. In the current environment, this limited commodity and volume exposure, coupled with our track record of consistently doing what we say we'll do, are important risk differentiators for us versus many others in the midstream space. Our focus continues to be on operating our business safely and reliably and delivering on our growth and dividend promises for investors, in both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners. 
You've previously seen this slide outlining our priorities. So let me provide an update on our progress. First, we're very pleased that the recent transactions initiated by Spectra Energy and Phillips 66 to strengthen DCP are complete, with the transactions closing on October 30th As we've said previously, the contributions made by the owners, along with the other initiatives underway at DCP, established a foundation for sustainable cash flows at DCP Midstream over the longer run.
DCP quickly adjusted to the rapidly changing industry environment and continues to be extremely diligent in taking actions of its own to ensure its longer-term success. Over the past year, DCP has engaged in various self-help initiatives, including the sale of $200 million of noncore or underperforming assets, reducing base costs by approximately $70 million and launching the restructuring of its commodity-sensitive contracts, which, combined with hedging, will decrease fee-based earnings.
As an example, you may have seen the recent announcement of a 10-year renewal of contract with one of the largest investment-grade independent producers in the Permian. This new contract has been converted at significantly better margins from a percent of proceeds to 100% fee-based and covers approximately 1 million dedicated acres. DCP is on track, if not slightly ahead, of where they need to be to achieve their contract conversion goal of reducing 1/3 of its commodity-exposed NGL length by the end of 2017.
With the support provided by the owners and DCP's own initiatives, it's our view that DCP has the ability to realize breakeven cash flows and make ongoing positive economic contribution to the owners at current commodity prices, while remaining well positioned to further benefit from industry recovery. This turnaround is significant and a direct reflection of all the actions taken to strengthen this must-run business. 
Next, completing our secured backlog and doing so on time and on budget continues to be key to our execution advantage. We also remain diligent in advancing and securing projects in development to ensure we deliver on our growth objectives. Finally, we continue to believe there will be industry consolidation opportunities and that could advance our value creation objectives and complement our business profile. 
With that, let me update you on the projects we have in execution. You've seen this slide many times before, and it's a great scorecard to track the success that we've had so far in executing on our growth plans. Not only are we consistently demonstrating that our project development time lines and budgets are reliable but also that we're able to realize some upside from placing projects into service early. Our Uniontown to Gas City project began delivering gas to the Midwest on August 1 and was fully in-service September 1, 2 full months ahead of the schedule.
Additionally, the first segment of OPEN was also put into service about 6 weeks ahead of schedule, and the remaining portion of OPEN has a November in-service date. We're very proud of the track record on project execution and pleased with the growth that these projects offer our investors. Since our last earnings call, we've moved $1.4 billion of expansion projects into service. And by year-end, that number will be almost $1.9 billion as we will place the 2015 Dawn-Parkway project fully into service, consistent with the originally planned in-service date. 
In aggregate, the expansion projects that will be placed into service this year, excluding those at DCP, will generate $135 million of EBITDA annually. These projects are fee-based, with no commodity or volume exposure, further adding to the stability of Spectra Energy's and Spectra Energy Partners' earnings and cash flows. 
Overall, 2015 will be a successful year for delivering projects into service and demonstrating our project execution advantage. Looking forward, our project backlog has almost $9 billion of projects still to be placed into service. As a reminder, all of these projects are underpinned by executed customer agreements. You'll also notice that about 75% of our expansion CapEx in execution is supported by secure contracts with demand-pull customers, such as gas -- local gas distribution companies, further demonstrating the strength of our current project backlog in this environment. 
All of our projects in execution are proceeding well and are on track to meet their respective in-service dates. And here's an indication of the great progress we've been making since our last earnings call. We have filed FERC regulatory applications for several U.S. projects: Atlantic Bridge, PennEast, Access South, Adair Southwest and the Lebanon Extension. In Western Canada, the Jackfish Lake, RAM and High Pine projects have either already been filed or will be filed this month with the National Energy Board. These projects represent about $1 billion of low-risk cost of service pipeline expansions. 
In addition, construction is underway on AIM, the 2016 Dawn-Parkway project and the Express Enhancement project, and we are on track to begin construction on Sabal Trail next year. A significant milestone will be met on NEXUS later this month when the project files its FERC application. 
Let's take a closer look at NEXUS and the progress we're making on that particular project. Many of you are familiar with NEXUS, but I want to take this opportunity to remind you of the scope of the project that we are jointly developing with DTE. The NEXUS project is a 250-mile 1.5 Bcf a day pipeline that will originate at Kensington, Ohio, and connect with DTE Gas in Michigan. This path will utilize TETCO, DTE gas and Vector Pipelines. The project represents tremendous opportunities for customers to access gas from both the Utica and Marcellus and move it through markets in Ohio and Michigan to the 150 Bcf a day Dawn storage hub, the second largest physical trading gas hub in North America and which is owned and operated by our own Union Gas. 
NEXUS is a key strategic project for us as it will ultimately connect Texas Eastern with the Union Gas system, something we've been envisioning for our customers for many years. To complete the upstream path of NEXUS, we're advancing the TEO project, an expansion of TETCO, to offer customers greater supply axis and market connectivity by transporting gas on Texas Eastern to Kensington, Ohio.
We'll be filing our FERC application for TEO later this month. As you know, downstream for NEXUS are the Union Gas' $1.5 billion Dawn to Parkway expansions, which provide customers in Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S. access to supply directly at the Dawn Hub and the capacity to move their gas to downstream markets. And as I mentioned earlier, the first phase of the Union Dawn -- Union Gas Dawn-Parkway expansion projects will be completed later this year.
NEXUS is moving forward with the support from executing customer agreements with LDCs to demand-pull markets as well as Marcellus and Utica producers. We've also recently signed a number of interconnect agreements with industrial facilities and power generators that could connect incremental load across Northern Ohio of up to 1.4 Bcf a day. Importantly, this demonstrates strong long-term market support for our route and the project, and we continue to see increased production forecast for the Appalachian region.
We've achieved several milestones in NEXUS this year, including the January approval by FERC to use the prefiling review process, selection of an EPCM contractor and securing pipe for the project. And as mentioned, NEXUS will file its FERC application later this month, and we would expect FERC to issue its approval to proceed in the second half of '16, thereby allowing us to achieve our in-service date of late 2017. 
So we're pleased with the progress we're making on NEXUS as well as the progress we continue to make on all of our projects in execution. When this backlog of projects is in service along with the others we'll place into service this year, investors can expect these projects to generate about $1 billion of EBITDA by 2020. 
Let's now shift our focus to projects in development. In addition to our backlog of projects in execution, we've got a robust portfolio of opportunities in development that will lead to continued growth in 2018 and beyond, and we're working diligently towards advancing those projects. We continue to make progress on our Access Northeast project, which is an expansion of our Algonquin system to serve the New England power generation markets and address electric reliability concerns during peak periods. 
This reliability is becoming a more critical concern each year as additional coal, oil and nuclear plants announce retirements. Key to Access Northeast is recognizing the importance of being directly connected to 60% of New England's gas-fired electric generators.
Gas deliveries to electric generators can only be guaranteed for those with the last mile firm transportation contracts. Electric generators without last mile firm transportation contracts have no guarantees of gas deliveries on peak demand days, regardless of firm contracts they may have on other pipelines. Access Northeast will largely solve this issue.
Earlier this week, we filed with FERC to use the prefiling review process for this project. At the state level, we are at a positive turning point to support for our approach and for the electric distribution companies to secure capacity continues to build with a series of separate but very consistent actions across the different states. 
Rhode Island's Affordable Clean Energy Security Act of 2014 authorizes the division of public utilities and carriers and the Office of Energy Resources to develop and issue open and competitive solicitations for infrastructure projects and clean energy resources. Last month, in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities confirmed its legal authority to review and approve EDC contracts to enhance electric reliability and reduce energy costs.
The main PUC's ongoing proceedings has recognized the benefits of examining a regional electrical reliability solution for main customers. Connecticut continues to make progress toward their RFP, focused on ensuring electric reliability as outlined in legislation passed this summer. And in New Hampshire, the PUC staff has issued a report supporting the legal authority for EDCs to enter into gas pipeline capacity contracts.
We've made significant progress since the region's governors came together around the reliability challenge they identified in 2013. We're optimistic that before the year is over, some of the electric distribution companies will be filing contracts for state approval. As a result, with all this positive momentum, we're now even more confident in our ability to move Access Northeast into execution in the first half of 2016. 
We continue to actively pursue many other projects in development and have ongoing productive discussions with potential customers. Interest remains strong in many of these projects, particularly those that are demand-pull. Supply-push discussions are proceeding at a slower pace in the current market environment. However, we remain highly confident that this infrastructure is needed and will ultimately be secured by the end of the decade. We will continue to actively engage with the market as the energy environment evolves and aggressively pursue the other projects in development.
Two years ago, our Drive to 35 originated from our expectation that we have the ability to secure contracts and pursue organic growth projects totaling $35 billion. To-date, we've been very successful on our efforts with almost $10 billion in-service and delivering cash and almost $9 billion remaining in our secured project execution backlog, which will add incremental cash flow beyond the current period.
We will continue to focus our efforts on organic growth since it's the most economically attractive way to grow, albeit often at a slower pace. We're not dependent on M&A to achieve our Drive to 35. However, the current environment may provide good opportunities to participate in industry consolidation, which could, in fact, expedite our efforts to achieve that goal. 
So we continue to deliver solid results, further proof of the resiliency of our underlying businesses and continued demonstration of our execution advantage. As I mentioned last quarter, not only do we believe that investors are beginning to differentiate between investment options in this environment but also that Spectra Energy and SEP offer best-in-class investment opportunities. Spectra Energy Partners is one of the lowest-risk MLP investments available, offering investors visible growth. The average remaining contract term within our gas pipeline business is about 9 years, and these are reservation-based contracts.
An Express crude pipeline has an average contract term of 10 years, revenues are our reservation-based with no commodity exposure and virtually no volume exposure, allowing us to provide quarterly distribution growth for our investors every quarter for the last 8 years. And we're committed to continuing that track record with 8% to 9% annual growth. Simply put, SEP is the most prudent, steady large pipeline MLP in existence today.
Spectra Energy offers an unrivaled footprint that connects all of the major North American supply basins with demand markets, a first and last mile advantage. With more than 1/2 its EBITDA coming from SEP's stable and reliable earnings, 99% of Spectra Energy's EBITDA for 2015 to '17 period will come from our fee-based businesses. And there's virtually no further commodity downside to our DCF forecast if commodity prices move slower. As such, we remain committed to growing Spectra Energy's annual dividend by $0.14 per share through 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to efficiently fund our impressive backlog of secured growth projects and pursuing new opportunities. We get two strong currencies for Spectra Energy shares and Spectra Energy Partners. Both companies have investment-grade balance sheets, which we're committed to, and we are disciplined in our financial management. So those are the attributes we believe differentiates Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners from other energy companies and why we believe so strongly that both our companies offer best-in-class low-risk investment opportunities today.
With that, let me turn things over to Julie so that we can take your questions."

I think that's going to make it very tough for some of those people to be able to execute on some of their plans. And so I think that could create some opportunity for us. Obviously, I think part of our interest is on the liquid side. Marley's [ph] open to gas. That's our base business. So I don't think the delta between the bid and ask has come down entirely yet. But again, as each quarter goes on and people see the strength of those people with pipeline assets like we have that have very steady, reliable and have committed to 8%, 9% type growth, that's going to be rewarded versus some folks who had maybe much loftier suggestions that people are going to realize in this environment that's not possible. So I think you're going to see strength to go to people of size and strength to go to people of low volatility. And I think that's advantage for both Spectra and Spectra Energy Partners."

But there are some unique regulatory aspects to it. But probably the biggest one that we've first had to get over was the fact of the legality, if you will, of EDC's holding pipeline capacity. I think in the last several months, that's largely been put to bed. And so that was a critical component. And now the other one, we'll just turn around getting contracts [indiscernible] regulators, which as I think we made in opening comments, we'd expect to see some of those folks do that before the end of the year."

But obviously, people will pay a lot to move product anywhere at this point in time, and you're obviously, attracting that flow rate for a relatively small incremental capital.

But by the next project, everybody has got the same competitive makeup. So it quickly dissipates. But that being said, we're taking advantage where we can on that front. And we are seeing some benefits on the steel front, I'd even say on turbines and things like that. But important to remember that the breakdown's about 70-30 for capital. In terms of 30% is hard assets, if you will. 70% is labor and regulatory and land. And Faisel, we're not seeing in any pullback in costs on those fronts. People are building projects in highly concentrated areas. As we all know, regulatory processes don't get any easier. Land issues, labor is tight in those locations. You can move steel from one part of the continent to the opposite side, but you can't move people that way, right? So I think the savings because of a relatively weak energy environment are not really showing up in full pipeline construction. You're getting some benefits on hard product, but again, most of the costs are on the other side. So we feel good about our estimates, but I don't see us seeing big cost savings in this environment."

Today, that's less than 30%. And the biggest chunk of margin comes from gas and NGL fee margins. And that's a substantial change in a year, and we've even seen about a 20% increase in the margins realized on gas processing on a fee basis.

Lastly, this is just kind of a macro question, not necessarily about your assets but maybe just Marcellus build out in general. We're seeing some massive dry Utica wells. And if this continues, I would think natural gas prices stay lower for longer, possibly pricing out some producers who might not have that exposure. So maybe it becomes less producers each with more market share now. I would think some of the producers are not going to make it, especially given leverage and balance sheet issues. At what point should we be worried about some of the counterparties on all the pipelines that are currently being developed to get out of the region? I understand a lot of your build-out is underpinned by utilities, but there is an element of supply-push out of the region. So I would be curious as to your thoughts and maybe some insight into the landscape out there. Are there outs for some of these producers, if the pipeline hasn't broken ground yet?"

Again, as you point out, 75% of our execution -- projects in execution are demand-pull. And low prices producers don't like it, but the demand side sure loves it. So that's a positive side of it. And as Pat said, 90% of our customers are investment grade or secured. I think if you looked at the U.S. side of things or the top 10 customers, which are investment grade except for one, would account for 50% of the revenue that we have. And in Canada, the same type of thing and all of those top 10, which account for 50% of revenue, would be investment grade. So feel pretty good where we are, but I think next spring is the time to kind of watch things. But I would also say just like we see at DCP in our places, and you've seen what the variety of producers talking about it this week and last week, but they're ripping out costs straight, left and center and so you're seeing some pretty dramatic drops in what you wouldn't have thought was possible a year ago is. So never underestimate the ability of necessity being the motherhood of invention here."

I think the issue would be -- so let's look at one realistically since it's already in service, which in retrospect I think maybe a good look. So let's look at New Jersey and New York. So you're talking about probably the pipeline that's delivering to, until recently, the most expensive place to get gas. Now that's New England. And two, the big backers of that pipeline, Statoil and Chesapeake. But -- so you can say, okay, well, Statoil very solid. Chesapeake is not investment grade today. But where they are delivering that gas is absolutely probably the most profitable piece of capacity that they own. So I think you can't look at it just who's the backing, but where is it going. And if you do not have first mile and last mile advantage, even if you've got contracts, I think you can have some challenges with your supply-push producers. If you've got that last mile advantage, that's going to be the most important project and/or capacity that they will hold. So I don't think you can look at it just solely on who's backing the project. Where is it going? And where it is going? Is that a demand market -- a premium demand market? That's the real value that suppliers -- supply-push players will look for even in a down market."

We have a giveback of -- a limited term giveback of our GP interest. And so as we look pro forma on the effect that SEP is neutral and, of course, that had to be the case to get the special committee to sign off on it. So don't see any pressure at all on SEP. If anything, it's perhaps slightly positive as we modeled it. So I don't think it changes at all the credit profile at SEP or how we'll fund growth there for the U.S. portion of our CapEx. At SE in consolidation, there is a small reduction, obviously, from the surrender of units and the GP giveback. But given where we are in the IDRs, it's not the full amount of the EBITDA that was transferred to DCP. And ironically, given the strong benefit to DCP of what we did and what our partner did matching with cash, I believe, we'll be in a situation to see cash distributions resume at DCP much earlier than they might have otherwise, in which case we'll get half back, if you think about it that way, of the contribution that we made. So net-net, for a company up top that has $3 billion of EBITDA, very small impact and no effect on SE's outlook for capital or credit."

SEP has added incremental projects and, therefore, results for EBITDA are going forward. Obviously, that comes to SE as well. So that's obviously, a positive from a credit perspective. Interest expense is staying lower and longer. That's obviously, positive. And frankly, we've done better from a maintenance capital perspective moving some stuff into '15 and that's obviously going to help us because maintenance programs typically would be multiyear projects in many respects and so moving some stuff into '15, given the results we have, actually are helpful in '16, '17.

That's not what we did. And those are going to be to tougher positions to find yourself in if you do not go to that last market. I think the supply push the producers are going to be looking for those types of contracts and saying, ""It's not really taking me to a premium market, do I need to re-up?
