I'm looking at you. Right, thanks. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us here today. If I were to talk to industry things that we've all been hearing about the last few weeks and, in particular,",3730,"Okay. Can everyone hear me? Now sound check. I'm looking at you. Right, thanks. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us here today. If I were to talk to industry things that we've all been hearing about the last few weeks and, in particular, probably the last few days, you'll have heard commodity prices, capital discipline and returns, restructuring and costs. I'm going to say that you'll hear a bit more of that during the course of my conversation. And I would hope that those here representing shareholders will see that we remain absolutely focused on delivering total shareholder returns. 
In terms of Anglo American, in the last 5 quarters, we've talked about delivering, and we have delivered on commitments. We've actually consistently increased our operations guidance, and we've consistently been cutting our capital. You will be in the same conversation, albeit coming off the December results. There's not going to be that much difference in the last 2 months in terms of what we've done but again, we're continuing to tighten up the business. And if I could say in a very somber way, it's a tough market. In terms of the work we've done, we've positioned ourselves to continue to improve, but I would say there's still a lot more to be done. And in our view, the markets will probably remain very tough the next 1 to 2 years. The real judge for us or the real challenge for us is to make sure that when the market does come back our way, we've done all the right things to ensure that we pick it up and go forward in a positive and constructive way and that we don't miss the lessons that had needed to be learned coming into the situation we're in. And I think in going through the conversations, the most important point for me to make is as an organization and, in particular, with our strategy now focal point on performance that's something we're determined we don't miss as a leadership team. And certainly, that's a constant conversation with the board, given where we've been, given where we are today and given where we're determined to get at in terms of the future. 
I will and we will, René and myself, be presenting. We will be relatively quick in moving to the data. We just come off of a fairly long session in December, and so from our point of view, we don't see much point in going back through the ground you already know. What we want to do is try to give you more opportunity to ask questions about what you see as being the critical issues in the business. So from our point of view, we'll move through fairly quickly, fairly briskly. If we don't pick up something during the course of the presentation, be very open to pick it up in Q&A and then follow that with our roundtable. So that gives you more of an opportunity to ask questions and hear our thoughts of the business from the things that you see as being important. 
I will start up with conversation around the meat and potatoes part of the business. So without fanfare, we'll talk about quickly, EBIT, $4.9 billion, down 25% obviously impacted by the lower prices and the platinum strike. I will talk about the impact on platinum a little bit later, and if we adjust for what that meant for the business, how we performed against across the portfolio. In going through the clean numbers and you will have seen those numbers and we'll pick these points up and I, in particular, will dissect those numbers in more detail. So I won't go through that any further than to say the net debt number, 12.9 is about 1.8 less than we thought it would be when we were thinking forward 12 months ago. It reflects improvement in operating performance, tight control of capital, delivery on projects ahead of schedule and under cost, and it reflects a real focus on making sure that we could control those things we can control. There is some timing issues in capital but not significant. That's been achieved despite a tough pricing environment that we've experienced right across the portfolio. But from our point of view, that's been a very important number. And as a consequence of being able to manage the balance sheet in those exposures, we've been able to maintain the dividend. And we're confident with what we're doing and where we are even with these price environment that we'll manage that and continue to deliver on our commitments, both in terms of debt targets and dividend. 
From operations perspective across the business, Sishen delivered 15% above the plan, and at the same time, you will see that our waste numbers were a little bit less than what we were targeting. But if you remember halfway through the year, we said we've stripped 10% out of the long life of mine to waste schedule. So the waste that was moved is consistent with an operating plan, and the business is on track to deliver its ore targets for 2015 and 2016, and we've increased our or production guidance for 2016. So Norman and the guys have done some good work. 2015 is going to be a big year still, but good performance across those targets with more to be done. 
Minas-Rio, not much else to be said, 2 months early ahead of schedule rather, 2 months early, $400 million lower than the schedule. Platinum restructure are on track. Divestment process underway. I'll talk a little bit about that a bit later, and René will pickup divestments. Copper and nickel both turned around, very happy with the progress that's been made. I won't say much else about nickel later in the presentation. Just to make a comment that we've more than doubled production from where we started. We've got 30% out of the cost. The further rebuild started on the day we said it would come, and we're tracking ahead of the schedule so very pleased there. 
And De Beers, good work in the markets. The one thing that really pleases me is the operating improvements we've seen in De Beers, and I'll pick that up a little bit later. So generally, delivery on all of our major commitments, pretty happy with the progress but a lot more to be done. 
Safety, key measure for us in any environment. Obviously, no one's ever going to accept one fatality in any business, so for us, the loss of 6 colleagues is a tragedy and is something that we definitely feel. Having said that, we're pleased with the progress, reducing fatality rates by 60%, the single, most significant improvement in one year in the group's history, best side of safety results we delivered a 25% reduction in our total frequency rate. When we go back to the fatality number, if you remember in 2014, we had 1 incident where we lost 6 colleagues. So if I compared safety incidents or fatal incidents to fatal incidents, the improvement is more like 40%, still solid, but it's closer to that 25% to 30% improvement across the accidents. I think that's a fair reflection of the progress we've made, and so still a lot more work to be done on safety, but we're pleased with the progress so far. 
On the environmental side, again, we're focused on all aspects of the business. When we present our results, we make sure we touch each the key cornerstone positions and things we're focused on. Our events, which are spills or emissions to the environment, down to 15. Seamus and the guys have done a lot of work on the coal business, and this is about flooding events across a number of jurisdictions, so big improvements, still more to be done. I guess when you look at our sustainable approach in the environment, committee relationships and the broader stakeholder relationships, if you go to any index across the industry, we're usually 1 of the top 3 as we should be. For us, it's strategic. The world is becoming a tougher place. You have to have the right relationships. You don't want to wake up in the morning and find out that your business have been stopped because you haven't got the right relationships. Again, we remain focused, and for us, this is a key metric and one that we talked about consistently with all other parts of the business. 
From an operations perspective, we've made good progress across the portfolio. Each business compared to 2013 has improved. I do make the comment that from a platinum point of view, obviously, we've adjusted for the strike. All of those operations that continued through the strike were 3% above where they were last year. And we're able to deliver all of our contractual commitments, so that was important. And Chris and team saw the potential for a strike, and we said we were going to stand our ground and make sure that the outcome was a sustainable outcome. It certainly was tougher than we thought it would be, but we did stand our ground. 
And in copper, I think Duncan is sensitive to how that appears on our overhead. You've got to remember that 8% [ph] and 7% reduction in head rates, so in terms of throughputs, he's up almost 10%. He's got longer leads and he's moving more waste. And so the performance on an underlying basis have been very strong, and in fact, he's 7% above his guidance numbers as well. So we're very pleased with the progress, albeit the actual headline volumes are down. So across-the-board, significant improvement across the business. I think this is the first time that we've outperformed across the portfolio in the last 10 years, and that's driven the outperformance on budget in those numbers. 
In terms of unit operating cost, we're really focused on margins, and obviously, cost is something we can control aggressively. If I start with the challenges, inflation. South Africa, the big challenge for us as a business across the portfolio around about 5%. In local dollar terms, our costs were 2% above where we were in 2013. In terms of real performance, we've reduced our cost by around 3%. I don't know what I've done. We reduced our cost by about 3%. The big challenge in South Africa and for us, Kumba, coal and platinum have each got structural changes in process to turn those trends around so that we're reducing our cost in local dollar terms. And I'll talk about that when we do the quick analysis on each of the business. And in copper terms, as I said, we have the grade, plus the increasing waste movements. On a real basis, the copper team, I think we're about 5% down, Duncan, in real terms. So in progress, but more to be done. And we don't try and take the credit of the U.S. dollars. Many will just report the U.S. dollars. We think it's required to report our nominal figures, so you know what we're trying to turn those things around, and quite frankly, the U.S. dollar will be what it will be. Just to report the final number, we're down around 5% across the portfolio in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. Lots more work to be done on cost, certainly made good progress, but a lot more to be done. We haven't bought these costs. That is we haven't try massive amounts of capital at this performance. In some businesses, you will see significant capital and volume increase of capital. This is about improving the business and improving the controllables we have without throwing capital, so we pulled our capital back at the same time. So a lot more work to be done. Good progress, but more to be done. 
On a broader basis, and René will pick these up, you'll see the business area by business area variations. De Beers, I'll talk about a little bit later. Both costs and operating improvements are underpinning a very good result there. The one thing I didn't want to say though in terms of our leases for diversified miner being the ability to manage through the cycle and through various commodity cycles, we should be in the long term in a more robust position. Certainly, 2014 price have brought that out. Again, if I adjust for the platinum strike, our drop in earnings of 25% would have been 14%. That puts us top in class across the majors in terms of dealing with the overall price big drop over the 12 months. We should be doing better than that in our view in terms of managing costs. We've made good progress, but we need to do more. But certainly, that I was, I thought, a pretty important chart. And again, René will give you another spaghetti chart that holds across all of the commodities to give you a sense of what it was done. 
In terms of the unit analysis, Kumba dominated obviously price effects and inflation variations in terms of the earnings. We also increased our waste volumes. The good news is that Norman and the team that the unit costs that were reduced for [indiscernible] which is about 10% actually offset the increase in waste costs. So there's been a good -- there's been good work on unit cost, but there's a lot more to be done, and Norman and the team, through the course of this year, will be working overheads and their efficiencies and the unit costs in driving up the operating model across the full business. If I had put the operating model in place, we're seeing improvements in efficiency of around 30%. They are seeing in some areas 60% improvements, but that's more about equipment and other factors that have been done. We try and separate the improving so we understand what's working, what's not working. 
From a waste movement perspective, as I said, because we've changed the actual configuration of equipment to longer term, our waste movements have dropped a little. It does shorten the life by about 18 months, so it's not significant, but it does front-end load the value or certainly improves the front, including value and in terms of the business. Big focus this year will be to continue the waste measurement, make sure that we're opening up the order to deliver the tonnes for this year and the 38 million tonnes, which is an upgrade on the 37 million tonnes that we forecast this time last year. 
On coal, again, significant improvement in the cost, and I think we're at about 16% or 17% costs on an apples-to-apples basis. I think Grasstree is probably the #1 long haul in the country now, Seamus? We did have some challenges by some hydraulic challenges that will take us probably to a midyear [indiscernible] sort through change its it's going to take a bit of time. We also had some geotechnical issue. We got through the worst of the long-haul areas, but we'll pick that back up. I'm very pleased with their performance and, in particular, this has been hard-nosed focused on efficiency, reducing cost overheads, regional operations, the restructuring of and the restructuring of Foxleigh, the pulling of prospect in the Hunter Valley, so significant performance improvement across-the-board. We are now a low quartile cost producer in the global metallurgical coal business. We're one of the best metallurgical coal qualities in the world, so certainly improving. We've now, I think, we're #1 and #3 in the long haul rankings in Australia as well, so we certainly outperformed our peers in those areas that you can compare apples with apples, and I think Seamus and the team done some great work. 
In copper, now if you remember from 2012 to 2013, we went from 660,000 tonnes after the problems in the pits with mine development. Duncan and the team have turned that back around last year, in particular, with a very strong second half. We delivered 770,000 tonnes. This year, I think we're at about just a tad under 750,000. We knew there was grade and waste headwinds that they were traveling into, but they're still continue to improve the operation with a 7% improvement, 7% to 10% improvement depending on where you are on throughputs. Remember also that the great drops of Los Bronces had a big impact, so the underlying performance has been strong. we've consolidated the recovery. The pits are in proper sequence, and they setup to continue to improve performance. The one caveat or the risk I think that we need to flag, and we did do this in December, is Chile it is still in drought. It remains a risk, and in fact, it was impacting our operating performance in November and December. And so there's a whole range of things we put in place. And I'll take it up as a broader risk for the business and for the industry, quite frankly, later in the presentation. So good progress, still a lot more work to be done. And certainly, Collahuasi Los Bronces are really clear as its for us longer term and the improvements continue. 
In the platinum business, the strike dominates. I'll just do with some good news and then come back to the strike. In terms of those assets, the continue to operation 4% above budget, doing pretty well, Mogalakwena, in particular, up to 370,000 ounces. So Chris and the team were able to find some additional process capacity. The mine certainly got the capacity to do that plus, and so I think some good work there. And as you know, Mogalakwena got 45% cash margin, before the 2% in this price environment but doing very well. And the progress on the pit looks good. And if you look at almost every quarter, there's been a step-change in efficiency and delivery of Mogalakwena. And certainly, the guys are making every post a winner, so good performance. The clear now for us is to continue to bring the operation down, settle the relationships, drive the efficiencies and continue under the disposal program. Clearly, that will create some tension in some of the conversations. The most important thing is we're ahead of the rationalization or the restructuring, I should say. We're ahead on the restructuring in terms of reducing numbers, making good progress. But we're going to have to tiptoe carefully as we manage all the Kumba relationships over the next 12 months, but again really pleased with the progress the guys have made and how well they've done since coming back from the strike. 
On De Beers, modest price improvements during the course of the year. Obviously, the market a bit softer towards the end of the year and into the new year, certainly not something that we're panicking you about. It is what we expect to see in terms of the market. The good news for us, I guess, from an operations perspective is that improvement there, which is running up 10%. Costs are down 10%. Our apples down in terms of volume down in terms of cost, and we a lot more resources and referred reserve. So that's really the encouraging. piece. So really good work at De Beers. And if you then the benefits of integration, the reduction in overheads, certainly, some improvements, and again, more to be done but encouraging progress. 
Minas-Rio, 2 months early, 400 million. Today, as we stand with exchange rates and everything else moving around, we're under $50 a tonne landed in Asia. Still a lot more work to be done, but we're very pleased with the rate of progress and decommissioning. We are seeing the usual problems, bit of what they're going to do without drilling blast, the normal thing you see but the progress have been very good. We've loaded 8 ships. I was actually in China the day before our first shipment arrived with one of our customers. The feedback we've had on the ships that we have delivered been very good, very high quality. Remember, it's a 67% product, low deleterious elements, so the quality or certainly been a hit. They're very pleased with the progress in terms of the operation. Clearly, it's a challenging market, and the team is working on what they've got to do to make sure we remain competitive in the market. And that's what the Kumba conversation and the Ministry of conversation, but very pleased with the progress that Paul and team knowledge there've been some good work. 
On the project side, this is Seamus. I think Seamus last week we hold through the underground workings, so it's ahead of schedule. It's on budget, so very pleased with the progress. You will see when we do -- when I talk about Driving Value that we've now put it in as a potential contributor in 2016. It wasn't in our early numbers, but they've done a good job. I'm certainly very pleased with the progress. We're commissioning Bell of the stubble of his the. It will make a number of contribution in 2016 as well. On the diamond side, minus 55 degrees. The looks like it's good, so the biggest risk to the project was getting supplies pretty looks like it's been navigated so, so far, so good. I don't want to put the marker on you, I'm just saying that at the moment it looks pretty good. The one disappointing area and I won't overplay it, but we did find is the licensing process at Cerrejón with our other 2 joint ventures through the management company was a bit tougher than anticipated, which is something we've seen right through South America. You will see that we haven't nominated a contribution on the project for driving value. But we have found, though, Seamus and the team with our colleagues in the asset have identified operating improvements that will likely make contribution in the operating asset improvement area as opposed to the project area. So for me, that's still a good outcome and some lessons to be learned in the licensing, but other parts of the project have all gone to plan. 
With that, I'll hand across to Mr. Midori."

Thank you very much, Mark, always very helpful. He's an engineer. I'm an economist. Okay, good morning, everybody. First, in the highlights of the dividend. We maintain the final dividend that $0.53. We are fully committed to our dividend",815,"The other one. Thank you very much, Mark, always very helpful. He's an engineer. I'm an economist. Okay, good morning, everybody. 
First, in the highlights of the dividend. We maintain the final dividend that $0.53. We are fully committed to our dividend policy, which is to maintain or increase the dividend through the cycle. In terms of earnings, 17% decline of earnings compared to 25% decline in EBIT. That's due to the business mix. De Beers contributed in excess of 40% of the group earnings in 2014 compared to 20% in the prior year. You remember the way we account for one-off, the joint venture in Botswana. We consolidated this one on an after-tax basis, so that reduced the reported tax rate. 
In terms of tax rate for the current year, 2015, we expect tax rate between 30% and 32%. We also reported an impairment of $3.9 billion. I flagged this potential impairment at the December Investor Day. I think it was to answer a questions from you, Jason. $3.9 billion, quickly for Minas-Rio. As you know, we are completed the project ahead of the revised schedule, and we also announced that the total CapEx will be $400 million lower than the revised number, so no change from an operational standpoint. It's all driven by lower commodity prices, lower iron ore price in the short but also our expectation in the medium to long term. 
Both CapEx and net debt, just slightly better than the guidance we gave you back here in December. And return on capital employed, 8%. At constant, June 2013, price that 10%, so similar to 2013, again at constant prices. 
Turning to the price variance for the first half. We reported a 3% decline in basket price. The price erosion accelerated in the second half, so 9% for the full year. That includes for the full year almost a $200 million mark-to-market adjustment for copper. At the end of December, we had 165,000 tonnes of copper provisioning price at $2.87, the current price around $2.57. There were some further price erosion since the beginning of the year. The basket price declined 3% again due to copper. There was also, as Mark mentioned, a further easing in diamond price in January. 
Turning to the EBIT variance. I already cover the price variance of $2.4 billion. FX, so the decline in currency -- in the countries in which we operate had a positive impact of $1.3 billion, $800 million around goes through the benefit of weaker Aussie dollar and Chilean pesos. 
Inflation, 5% on a weighted average for the group, again South Africa being the main contributor with the CPI in excess of 6%. Then you see the benefit of the operational improvement that Mark has covered, both the 4% increase in production or the copper HLR but also the 3% decline in nominal real prices. As the platinum strike impact $760 million. That's impact both during the strike as well as during the ramp-up period seen in the second half of 2014. 
Turning to CapEx. $6 billion CapEx in 2014. 2 main projects in '14. Minas-Rio, we spent $1.9 billion; and Russ Vin in met coal is $4.5 [ph] billion. You see the improvement in SIB CapEx, 10% decline due to $2 billion despite the condition increase of 4% that I mentioned earlier. 2015, we have revised our guidance slightly lower, so at the bottom of the range that we gave you in December. We expect CapEx of $5.2 billion in 2015. And you remember that I flagged that we'll have more flexibility in 2016 with the level of committed CapEx below $4 billion. 
Turning to the cash flow and debt level. In terms of cash flow and debt for 2014, negative cash flow of $2.2 billion after the payment of the dividend of $1.1 billion. For 2015, at spot prices, with the level of CapEx around $5.2 billion and the benefit of the disposal of Tarmac, we expect the level of debt to peak between $13.5 billion and $14 billion at the end of 2015. 
In 2016, again, at spot prices, we had a level of committed CapEx of below $4 billion. We expect to be cash neutral after the payment of the dividend. We also highlighted back in December level of liquidity at $15 billion at the end of December, and we expect to maintain this level of liquidity over the next 2 years, limiting refinancing both in '15 and '16, $1.7 billion in '15 and $1.6 billion in 2016. 
We are progressing the restructuring of the group portfolio. You are familiar with the progress on Tarmac. We expect to close the transaction, again subject to the main merger being approved between Holcim and Lafarge. We expect to complete the transaction before June 2015. We have also added 2 assets to our disposal program in Australia, and Foxleigh. 
Thank you."
409115,283684193,762232,"Anglo American plc, 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Completely expected you to jump in my notes up, Renée. Just to be respectful. Just a quick wrap. Firstly, Driving Value. Progress during the course of the year, you see the waterfall charts went well. Projects, we've actually delivered during the course",2136,"Completely expected you to jump in my notes up, Renée. Just to be respectful. Just a quick wrap. Firstly, Driving Value. Progress during the course of the year, you see the waterfall charts went well. Projects, we've actually delivered during the course of 2014. You'll notice that these top line targets have actually hardened up, and we're now on track to $4 billion. If you remember, we started at $3.4 billion. We have $500 million worth of projects that we believe we could bring through. They have now been identified most of them had plans actually put against them, and we still got some cleaning up to do, but pretty confident now on the $4 billion. We'll close that gap. If we take consensus prices, that's the difference between the original starting point. But I think beyond that conversation which you've seen, what we've done is I just put 3 overheads here to explain the projects that underpinned the business improvement numbers and give you a sense of the spot price sensitivity so that it'll help you reconcile where we're going and what we're doing. I think the most important point to make is that we're on track to deliver the restructuring targets that we set from the outset. That's the key point to make, and certainly, we think this will might help the conversation and people understanding where we're going. 
Minas-Rio, based on all the original parameters, will deliver on this targets. Boa Vista Fresh Rock will make a nominal contribution. And Barro Alto, in fact, is probably going to do a little bit better than we thought, but we still kept at the $100 million that we nominated, which was the furnace rebuild a better contribution but the great thing about Barro Alto the encouraging thing is that we're able to pull 30% out of the cost to make significant improvements even with the furnaces in the condition they're in, so that's been a positive. So we're on track to deliver our project targets the $900 million that we originally set. Sorry, I should make a point that, that number really gives you a sense of the impact of prices on the project delivery component. 
The asset improvements, and again, I'm not going to go through these just to let you know that we're the broad buckets where we're tracking. We are now -- we said net-net, net of headwinds, we would have delivered $1.2 billion. It's now looking more like $1.6 billion, which take some of the $500 million that we've identified into hardboard project in the improvement. Now if you go back to my business-by-business analysis, if you look at the green, which is the operating performance improvement; and the red, which is a headwind, we net those 2 together to come up with this bottom line table, so we net the 2. So Renée's operating contribution, where you saw $700 million, is net of the positive operating improvements and the headwinds, for example, the coppers headwind that will help reconcile those numbers. And again, if any questions, Paul and the team will just guide you through that. Particularly clear where we see the opportunities. In terms of those things that are now being worth so in terms of the hardwiring of timing and schedules, the improvements based on what we see and the good work Norman and the team have done, Seamus and the guys, every day is about finding another dollar. Copper, Duncan and the team are working very hard at all the pieces they're putting together. And Philippe and the team working right across the portfolio to improve margins. All very important and all pretty good. And again, sorry, I should point out the impact of the pricing assumptions just to give you a reconciling point. 
On this side, which is the Driving Value, value leakage. We've already polled $330 million out of that part of that program. We'll certainly do better than the $300 million, but we're holding $300 million at the moment. On supply chain, somewhere we can still some work to do. Until we get the full 2016 target. We have set up new strategic relationships, Joy, Caterpillar, Komatsu and others just work through the process, but certainly some goods indication. This one, we will point to, if I could just make one simple observation. Better than 2.7% or 3% above our reference price, the performance in the commercial team has been exceptional in terms of driving value. We've got the hardwired number we compared to and it's certainly making a very good contribution, so really pleased with the progress of Peter and the team. We remain low key because it's always that one that some people a little bit skeptical. But against our reference prices, they've made significant improvements in ground. I spent time, Peter, myself over in Asia talking to our customers, and the different approach we're taking with a customer's is certainly been appreciated and we're seeing it across-the-board. That will move around a little bit depending on the market the circumstance and prices going down. You tend to get that a bit more of a benefit, but against our peers and our targets are above with our peers talking to when they talk reference price, we're doing very well. We're very happy with the progress made and the Singapore team has been a big very good well. On overheads of still a lot more to be done. This year is a big as we roll through the restructuring. Kumba, you're aware of. Norman has already started in January, certainly reductions and another certain to come. He's done 189 [ph] so he's running to the progress. He's got 2 months up and then he find the next level of change. That's going on right across the business, so that's one of those things you keep working through the pulled the numbers down, so we expect to hit the 500 target. So across-the-board, we target at $1.5 billion, which is on what we said before. And the pricing impact of that is negligible because of on the cost side. So you should get full value so that work and we're making good progress. 
In terms of risks, the one thing I think we should always do is flag through where we see the risks. These are industry risks in many cases, and there are specific risks with us across the portfolio. I just to let you know what we're doing. In terms of asset disposals, for us, it's strategic. The reason we're pruning back the size of the portfolio, there are a number of assets that aren't making contribution and, in fact, the assets we're targeting for us have made a relatively modest contribution to EBIT. And certainly, from a life-of-mine perspective, they're not going to be the assets to move the dial. That's why we're selling the business, and that's why we won't be pressed to sell something if it's not the reasonable value. But at the same time, we're not going to argue about the last dollar because it's just strategic play, not about the simple dollars. And so for us, that's -- we're going well on as René indicated on Tarmac. The issue for as well be across other parts abruptly. We've been a number of offers some very encouraging, some not terribly good. For us, probably likely path we will be the listing option in platinum, but we do have cash offers on the table, so it's a matter of how those 2 will compare up over the next few months. But certainly, by midyear, Chris will be pretty clearly knowing where he's going, making good progress on that. Same for copper, same for coal. We added 2 assets, which we've been taking about for sometime. Seamus and the team went through the whole analysis, very happy that, that's the right thing to do with those assets in the portfolio. In terms of ROCE, South America in the midst of a 5-year drop. You've got shortages of water in Chile, in Brazil as well, and so all companies are going to have to manage access to water very carefully. We've already identified alternative sources. We've already got a range of things that Duncan and the team have put in place to protect the Collahuasi, Los Bronces that's happening across-the-board. We've got other additional contingencies in residual I guess the message I'd say is if you hold portfolios that have got asset in South America, it's a good question of asking what are you doing about water across the portfolio. For us, it's very important. We're working hard to make sure that we minimize any impact, if there are any. 
Power in South Africa, again, most of you know. We do have flexibility within each of our operations, but there's a limit to that flexibility. Working with the government, certainly, there's a sensitivity in the government to make sure that industry is not starved for power and create more financial pressure. But it's one that we're watching very carefully and working with the government to make sure that the got options in place. And all the things we can do internally within the business with our own emergency generation to the people up and help the situation and that's an ongoing conversation. But again, generally, we've traveled through the last few months pretty well, but the country is tight, and so we're watching that carefully. And finally, right across the globe, mining life is a big issue. The sustainability conversation, the relationship you have with local governments is absolutely critical. It's strategic, and it's one that we're certainly talking a lot of interest in to make sure that we don't have major surprises in the business. 
Not going to do a summary. If we just finish off with key deliverables. Ministry -- we want to see that at least 80% capacity by year-end. That will put us in a place to deliver our 26.5 target for 2016. That's where Paul and the team are very focused and at the right costs. We've got the opportunity to keep working those cost now. That's what Paul is doing. He will be, in parallel, implementing the new operating model as he commissions the site as well, so he's going to work on both sides of the question. 
Portfolio, Renée talked about, the other assets are in process. We've only taken into account that the Lafarge, Tarmac this year in terms of our numbers, we do expect the bulk of things to be finished off by the end of '16, but again, the only caveat there is we are not any far, so we're not pressed. We've manage the balance sheet every dollar we put out of the operations are certainly having a 2 to 3x effect on the debt that we're reporting, and that's where the big focus is, but we'll work those sites of the street. Operating model, the key is to get this out faster. The benefits that we've seen in coal, at Sishen are now being taken on and rolled out to other parts of the business. Chris, Duncan, Norman and other parts of Kolomela, they've have already picked up the key elements and are cherrypicking and supporting improvements in their operations, plus our team is making good progress. So it's had a much broader impact, so there are the areas that we're focusing on in the next 12 months. And for us, as I said, in managing mining inflation in South Africa, it's not simply about mining smarter and efficiency. It's about structural change and efficiencies. And for us, productivity is a keyword in South Africa. Norman has already made announcements about what he's doing, head office overheads, his efficiencies and the improvement he's made. He's already made the 10% improvement on his unit operating cost. There's more to be had. That's where he's focused with the team. In platinum, the restructuring of the business so that we ultimately come down to Mogalakwena [indiscernible] as the core of the asset, dominating the left-hand side of the cost curve. Mogalakwena 45% margin on des prices today. It will be a very different business within 2 to 3 years. And thermal coal, the early signs in the rollout of the operating model we've seen very good improvements in productivity. In particular, we've seen big increases in equipment performance, which is something we want to roll out more broadly in South Africa. And we'll learn from what we're doing here and then take that into other parts of business and vice versa. So big push this year in getting south African cost back in control and running certainly significantly lower than those normal inflation rates. 
With that, we're very happy to take questions."

Or would you see Anglo American or Anglo platinum holding onto a stake in that? And then secondly, a question on working capital I guess for René.

We obviously have Minas-Rio, which I guess is some stuff going on at De Beers. I'm just wondering if you could maybe provide some commentary around stripping those one-offs, if you like, or special items, what do you think the underlying working capital performance was for the business?"

Going the other way, we are -- the benefit from production standpoint or the recovery at Kumba and we refinish the level of inventory in Kumba. So flat on inventory side. On the side, it was a reduction of $400 million, both the pricing reduction, which is what you saw I guess yesterday with Rio, but also there was highly debtors at Kumba at the end of 2013.

I think the mining companies that have done well long term of those companies that have worked the resources to their potential, I think that's we're the big opportunity is for Anglo American.

Clearly, the work is going on in getting the scope of the resource both for Collahuasi and Los Bronces.

Everything we done today suggests we've got a much bigger resource potential. I want won't put numbers for it. That would be inappropriate at this stage. But certainly, how we can work those through being off there. I think water is the key issue. And as you know, we're doing environmental work on [indiscernible] which is adjacent to Los Bronces and also during the regional exploration. So both are in the early phases, and certainly, we're not in a position to say this or that. But by the end of this year, in our December review, we'll give you much better shape in terms of both of those in terms of direction in travel and what the key issues will be in taking those assets up to their potential. On specifically, I think, first, we got to say good progress on the feasibility work and the project development strategy. We certainly enhanced the project in many ways. I'm very pleased with the progress that's been made. The project will go to the board in June for review. The challenges we have, as you all know, is around copper price in the market, so those issues will be taking into account. Our approach in any investment of this type will be to syndicate the project, so all of the things we said from a strategic point of view hold. And from our point of view, I think it's important to acknowledge unlike many projects that are being talked about, we've got tremendous support from the government at the Federal level, the regional level and the local community. So we've done all the work at all the right levels to position the project. The key will be the market and how we assess things going forward in terms of what we can do and we'll have discussions with the board midyear. But so far, all of the things we said we do, we've done. We've got great support all the way through the market is absolutely critical.

On Minas-Rio, I mean it's still early in decommissioning. We said 33 to 35 operating cost. About 70% of our cost are denominated in real. 30% -- I think at USD 72.28. We've obviously got a big kick out on freight. So our delivery costs are well under 55, well over 50 actually based on current costs. Paolo and the team seized some opportunities to improve the cost base, but we're not going to change the 33 to 35 until he's got 6 to 9 months under his build on commissioning. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. By the year-end, we'll give you a good look on our way we think we're it is. We still think the operating model has got a lot of possibilities, but at the same time, I think early the forecasts on real. I think 2.7, a few weeks back, it was 2.3, 2.4. So there's a fair bit of movement. And so we'll stick with the current guidance until we've got some hard stuff see we're going to do much better.

We said that the market was a little weaker. It's still too early to forecast beyond where we are today. I think we've had 1 site fully this year. Yes, it's a bit weaker post-Christmas. We expected that. I think you've got to be in the second quarter before we give good sense of how well the market's moving forward. There were some good reports in sales. There were some weaker reports. At the moment still a little mixed. We're certainly doing better than others are reporting in terms of their value received per products. Don't forget, quality, De Beers is the diamond market in many ways in terms of the quality and what we put out there, so a bit early to pick. We're certainly not suggesting a negative contribution in terms of the tax, so don't connect the 2 there, 2 separate conversations. And from our point of view, the De Beers team have done a very good job operationally, and we're looking for those trends to continue during the course of the next 12 to 18 months. So we're very proud of what the De Beers team have done, and certainly, we'll be doing everything to support them as they go forward and improve the business overall. But the market is a little bit weaker, but certainly, from our point of view, we're hopeful in terms of looking forward. Tax, do you want to make a specific comment on tax, René?"

There's a very low tax rate in 2014 because we were able following the approval of the project to recognize the fair tax asset associated with some tax losses in Canada. So the tax rate for the De Beers will be higher in 2015 than it was in 2014. So that's why the guidance that I gave you is between 30% and 32%. On the CapEx side, Mark, do you want to answer the question? The number we gave you is below $4 billion doesn't include [indiscernible] that's the project which is on the horizon. The question is whether when we will approve it, when we will go ahead. But in any case, we will this project. So as we sell down, we expect we'll be able to monetize some of the value.

As René said, we would syndicate and decision to go forward would go with the syndication decision, which would manage our capital inside the targets that we've talked to. Other projects will have to then run the gamut of the market and the discipline and the targets we set for ourselves as a business. I still think there's improvement available in our ongoing capital spend. We've improved our capital efficiency more than 10%. I still think there's a lot more there in certain areas. Other areas have done pretty well pulling their capital down. So from our point of view, I think there's a lot more we can do on capital, albeit there's been some really good guide. So if I could make the point, you're not going to see a major capital blowout in this organization. We're going to be prudent, careful, but we're also going to make sure that we're making decisions for the long-term benefit of the business. And so, if it's the right decision to go forward, what we'll do is we'll think about the syndication is a way the financing it and protecting our flexibility as the business and making the right call.

We said very clearly that the government we were looking to reduce because the domestic supply lines are generally smaller scale, shorter life, so from our point of view, just dialing down our position over time. The government was actually quite supportive of that conversation because they're looking for more than 51% for supplies. So their point of view line with what they wanted to see. So we originally started the conversation that's a strategic position. If someone were to come in and offer us something to step right back, then we'd be open to that conversation. And we're certainly not out there canvassing. We'll see what comes in. The current situation, no difference, no change for our strategy, and it's been a constructive open conversation and we seen no major barbs on that. Key issue, make sure that whatever comes in can deliver on this social level playing commitments, appropriate level of transformation in terms of the mining charter, and beyond that, it's a commercial transaction. It is a free country Constitution. You do what you do appropriately and treat us with respect. That's it. In terms of the head office restructuring, I mean you got to be a bit careful. When we look at overhead, we look at any board that's not on a side touching the product. And we've been restructuring the overheads right across the group. I think reductions in London are over 150. We're continuing reductions, but we are moving things around. We're closing offices. For example, we've closed São Paulo. We've closed a number of offices around the globe as we've consolidated our base metals business in Brazil. Duncan's been rationalizing his copper regional structures. Seamus, I think, was 350 reduction, Seamus, between Australia and South Africa. That's the last I think this is the fifth time you've gone through so it's really squeezing it down. London, we are consolidating some technical functions. And Seamus, for example, is now sitting in London hurting because of the price of properties in the country. But so we've started that we're continuing on the program, we'll continue through the year in terms of production. So if I look across the broad, the broad spectrum, we're about 20% and continuing. For us, you'll see that we're down 40% on the numbers. And by the end of the year, we'll be at a $500 million run rate, and we expect to go beyond that as we look at the impact of disposals on the structures as well, which will go into 2016. So it will be continuing across the globe. Okay. Can we take a call from South Africa? Paul, I'm not sure. Okay, good."

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us here today. If I were to talk to industry things that we've all been hearing about the last few weeks and, in particular, probably the last few days, you'll have heard commodity prices, capital discipline and returns, restructuring and costs. I'm going to say that you'll hear a bit more of that during the course of my conversation. And I would hope that those here representing shareholders will see that we remain absolutely focused on delivering total shareholder returns. 
In terms of Anglo American, in the last 5 quarters, we've talked about delivering, and we have delivered on commitments. We've actually consistently increased our operations guidance, and we've consistently been cutting our capital. You will be in the same conversation, albeit coming off the December results. There's not going to be that much difference in the last 2 months in terms of what we've done but again, we're continuing to tighten up the business. And if I could say in a very somber way, it's a tough market. In terms of the work we've done, we've positioned ourselves to continue to improve, but I would say there's still a lot more to be done. And in our view, the markets will probably remain very tough the next 1 to 2 years. The real judge for us or the real challenge for us is to make sure that when the market does come back our way, we've done all the right things to ensure that we pick it up and go forward in a positive and constructive way and that we don't miss the lessons that had needed to be learned coming into the situation we're in. And I think in going through the conversations, the most important point for me to make is as an organization and, in particular, with our strategy now focal point on performance that's something we're determined we don't miss as a leadership team. And certainly, that's a constant conversation with the board, given where we've been, given where we are today and given where we're determined to get at in terms of the future. 
I will and we will, René and myself, be presenting. We will be relatively quick in moving to the data. We just come off of a fairly long session in December, and so from our point of view, we don't see much point in going back through the ground you already know. What we want to do is try to give you more opportunity to ask questions about what you see as being the critical issues in the business. So from our point of view, we'll move through fairly quickly, fairly briskly. If we don't pick up something during the course of the presentation, be very open to pick it up in Q&A and then follow that with our roundtable. So that gives you more of an opportunity to ask questions and hear our thoughts of the business from the things that you see as being important. 
I will start up with conversation around the meat and potatoes part of the business. So without fanfare, we'll talk about quickly, EBIT, $4.9 billion, down 25% obviously impacted by the lower prices and the platinum strike. I will talk about the impact on platinum a little bit later, and if we adjust for what that meant for the business, how we performed against across the portfolio. In going through the clean numbers and you will have seen those numbers and we'll pick these points up and I, in particular, will dissect those numbers in more detail. So I won't go through that any further than to say the net debt number, 12.9 is about 1.8 less than we thought it would be when we were thinking forward 12 months ago. It reflects improvement in operating performance, tight control of capital, delivery on projects ahead of schedule and under cost, and it reflects a real focus on making sure that we could control those things we can control. There is some timing issues in capital but not significant. That's been achieved despite a tough pricing environment that we've experienced right across the portfolio. But from our point of view, that's been a very important number. And as a consequence of being able to manage the balance sheet in those exposures, we've been able to maintain the dividend. And we're confident with what we're doing and where we are even with these price environment that we'll manage that and continue to deliver on our commitments, both in terms of debt targets and dividend. 
From operations perspective across the business, Sishen delivered 15% above the plan, and at the same time, you will see that our waste numbers were a little bit less than what we were targeting. But if you remember halfway through the year, we said we've stripped 10% out of the long life of mine to waste schedule. So the waste that was moved is consistent with an operating plan, and the business is on track to deliver its ore targets for 2015 and 2016, and we've increased our or production guidance for 2016. So Norman and the guys have done some good work. 2015 is going to be a big year still, but good performance across those targets with more to be done. 
Minas-Rio, not much else to be said, 2 months early ahead of schedule rather, 2 months early, $400 million lower than the schedule. Platinum restructure are on track. Divestment process underway. I'll talk a little bit about that a bit later, and René will pickup divestments. Copper and nickel both turned around, very happy with the progress that's been made. I won't say much else about nickel later in the presentation. Just to make a comment that we've more than doubled production from where we started. We've got 30% out of the cost. The further rebuild started on the day we said it would come, and we're tracking ahead of the schedule so very pleased there. 
And De Beers, good work in the markets. The one thing that really pleases me is the operating improvements we've seen in De Beers, and I'll pick that up a little bit later. So generally, delivery on all of our major commitments, pretty happy with the progress but a lot more to be done. 
Safety, key measure for us in any environment. Obviously, no one's ever going to accept one fatality in any business, so for us, the loss of 6 colleagues is a tragedy and is something that we definitely feel. Having said that, we're pleased with the progress, reducing fatality rates by 60%, the single, most significant improvement in one year in the group's history, best side of safety results we delivered a 25% reduction in our total frequency rate. When we go back to the fatality number, if you remember in 2014, we had 1 incident where we lost 6 colleagues. So if I compared safety incidents or fatal incidents to fatal incidents, the improvement is more like 40%, still solid, but it's closer to that 25% to 30% improvement across the accidents. I think that's a fair reflection of the progress we've made, and so still a lot more work to be done on safety, but we're pleased with the progress so far. 
On the environmental side, again, we're focused on all aspects of the business. When we present our results, we make sure we touch each the key cornerstone positions and things we're focused on. Our events, which are spills or emissions to the environment, down to 15. Seamus and the guys have done a lot of work on the coal business, and this is about flooding events across a number of jurisdictions, so big improvements, still more to be done. I guess when you look at our sustainable approach in the environment, committee relationships and the broader stakeholder relationships, if you go to any index across the industry, we're usually 1 of the top 3 as we should be. For us, it's strategic. The world is becoming a tougher place. You have to have the right relationships. You don't want to wake up in the morning and find out that your business have been stopped because you haven't got the right relationships. Again, we remain focused, and for us, this is a key metric and one that we talked about consistently with all other parts of the business. 
From an operations perspective, we've made good progress across the portfolio. Each business compared to 2013 has improved. I do make the comment that from a platinum point of view, obviously, we've adjusted for the strike. All of those operations that continued through the strike were 3% above where they were last year. And we're able to deliver all of our contractual commitments, so that was important. And Chris and team saw the potential for a strike, and we said we were going to stand our ground and make sure that the outcome was a sustainable outcome. It certainly was tougher than we thought it would be, but we did stand our ground. 
And in copper, I think Duncan is sensitive to how that appears on our overhead. You've got to remember that 8% [ph] and 7% reduction in head rates, so in terms of throughputs, he's up almost 10%. He's got longer leads and he's moving more waste. And so the performance on an underlying basis have been very strong, and in fact, he's 7% above his guidance numbers as well. So we're very pleased with the progress, albeit the actual headline volumes are down. So across-the-board, significant improvement across the business. I think this is the first time that we've outperformed across the portfolio in the last 10 years, and that's driven the outperformance on budget in those numbers. 
In terms of unit operating cost, we're really focused on margins, and obviously, cost is something we can control aggressively. If I start with the challenges, inflation. South Africa, the big challenge for us as a business across the portfolio around about 5%. In local dollar terms, our costs were 2% above where we were in 2013. In terms of real performance, we've reduced our cost by around 3%. I don't know what I've done. We reduced our cost by about 3%. The big challenge in South Africa and for us, Kumba, coal and platinum have each got structural changes in process to turn those trends around so that we're reducing our cost in local dollar terms. And I'll talk about that when we do the quick analysis on each of the business. And in copper terms, as I said, we have the grade, plus the increasing waste movements. On a real basis, the copper team, I think we're about 5% down, Duncan, in real terms. So in progress, but more to be done. And we don't try and take the credit of the U.S. dollars. Many will just report the U.S. dollars. We think it's required to report our nominal figures, so you know what we're trying to turn those things around, and quite frankly, the U.S. dollar will be what it will be. Just to report the final number, we're down around 5% across the portfolio in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. Lots more work to be done on cost, certainly made good progress, but a lot more to be done. We haven't bought these costs. That is we haven't try massive amounts of capital at this performance. In some businesses, you will see significant capital and volume increase of capital. This is about improving the business and improving the controllables we have without throwing capital, so we pulled our capital back at the same time. So a lot more work to be done. Good progress, but more to be done. 
On a broader basis, and René will pick these up, you'll see the business area by business area variations. De Beers, I'll talk about a little bit later. Both costs and operating improvements are underpinning a very good result there. The one thing I didn't want to say though in terms of our leases for diversified miner being the ability to manage through the cycle and through various commodity cycles, we should be in the long term in a more robust position. Certainly, 2014 price have brought that out. Again, if I adjust for the platinum strike, our drop in earnings of 25% would have been 14%. That puts us top in class across the majors in terms of dealing with the overall price big drop over the 12 months. We should be doing better than that in our view in terms of managing costs. We've made good progress, but we need to do more. But certainly, that I was, I thought, a pretty important chart. And again, René will give you another spaghetti chart that holds across all of the commodities to give you a sense of what it was done. 
In terms of the unit analysis, Kumba dominated obviously price effects and inflation variations in terms of the earnings. We also increased our waste volumes. The good news is that Norman and the team that the unit costs that were reduced for [indiscernible] which is about 10% actually offset the increase in waste costs. So there's been a good -- there's been good work on unit cost, but there's a lot more to be done, and Norman and the team, through the course of this year, will be working overheads and their efficiencies and the unit costs in driving up the operating model across the full business. If I had put the operating model in place, we're seeing improvements in efficiency of around 30%. They are seeing in some areas 60% improvements, but that's more about equipment and other factors that have been done. We try and separate the improving so we understand what's working, what's not working. 
From a waste movement perspective, as I said, because we've changed the actual configuration of equipment to longer term, our waste movements have dropped a little. It does shorten the life by about 18 months, so it's not significant, but it does front-end load the value or certainly improves the front, including value and in terms of the business. Big focus this year will be to continue the waste measurement, make sure that we're opening up the order to deliver the tonnes for this year and the 38 million tonnes, which is an upgrade on the 37 million tonnes that we forecast this time last year. 
On coal, again, significant improvement in the cost, and I think we're at about 16% or 17% costs on an apples-to-apples basis. I think Grasstree is probably the #1 long haul in the country now, Seamus? We did have some challenges by some hydraulic challenges that will take us probably to a midyear [indiscernible] sort through change its it's going to take a bit of time. We also had some geotechnical issue. We got through the worst of the long-haul areas, but we'll pick that back up. I'm very pleased with their performance and, in particular, this has been hard-nosed focused on efficiency, reducing cost overheads, regional operations, the restructuring of and the restructuring of Foxleigh, the pulling of prospect in the Hunter Valley, so significant performance improvement across-the-board. We are now a low quartile cost producer in the global metallurgical coal business. We're one of the best metallurgical coal qualities in the world, so certainly improving. We've now, I think, we're #1 and #3 in the long haul rankings in Australia as well, so we certainly outperformed our peers in those areas that you can compare apples with apples, and I think Seamus and the team done some great work. 
In copper, now if you remember from 2012 to 2013, we went from 660,000 tonnes after the problems in the pits with mine development. Duncan and the team have turned that back around last year, in particular, with a very strong second half. We delivered 770,000 tonnes. This year, I think we're at about just a tad under 750,000. We knew there was grade and waste headwinds that they were traveling into, but they're still continue to improve the operation with a 7% improvement, 7% to 10% improvement depending on where you are on throughputs. Remember also that the great drops of Los Bronces had a big impact, so the underlying performance has been strong. we've consolidated the recovery. The pits are in proper sequence, and they setup to continue to improve performance. The one caveat or the risk I think that we need to flag, and we did do this in December, is Chile it is still in drought. It remains a risk, and in fact, it was impacting our operating performance in November and December. And so there's a whole range of things we put in place. And I'll take it up as a broader risk for the business and for the industry, quite frankly, later in the presentation. So good progress, still a lot more work to be done. And certainly, Collahuasi Los Bronces are really clear as its for us longer term and the improvements continue. 
In the platinum business, the strike dominates. I'll just do with some good news and then come back to the strike. In terms of those assets, the continue to operation 4% above budget, doing pretty well, Mogalakwena, in particular, up to 370,000 ounces. So Chris and the team were able to find some additional process capacity. The mine certainly got the capacity to do that plus, and so I think some good work there. And as you know, Mogalakwena got 45% cash margin, before the 2% in this price environment but doing very well. And the progress on the pit looks good. And if you look at almost every quarter, there's been a step-change in efficiency and delivery of Mogalakwena. And certainly, the guys are making every post a winner, so good performance. The clear now for us is to continue to bring the operation down, settle the relationships, drive the efficiencies and continue under the disposal program. Clearly, that will create some tension in some of the conversations. The most important thing is we're ahead of the rationalization or the restructuring, I should say. We're ahead on the restructuring in terms of reducing numbers, making good progress. But we're going to have to tiptoe carefully as we manage all the Kumba relationships over the next 12 months, but again really pleased with the progress the guys have made and how well they've done since coming back from the strike. 
On De Beers, modest price improvements during the course of the year. Obviously, the market a bit softer towards the end of the year and into the new year, certainly not something that we're panicking you about. It is what we expect to see in terms of the market. The good news for us, I guess, from an operations perspective is that improvement there, which is running up 10%. Costs are down 10%. Our apples down in terms of volume down in terms of cost, and we a lot more resources and referred reserve. So that's really the encouraging. piece. So really good work at De Beers. And if you then the benefits of integration, the reduction in overheads, certainly, some improvements, and again, more to be done but encouraging progress. 
Minas-Rio, 2 months early, 400 million. Today, as we stand with exchange rates and everything else moving around, we're under $50 a tonne landed in Asia. Still a lot more work to be done, but we're very pleased with the rate of progress and decommissioning. We are seeing the usual problems, bit of what they're going to do without drilling blast, the normal thing you see but the progress have been very good. We've loaded 8 ships. I was actually in China the day before our first shipment arrived with one of our customers. The feedback we've had on the ships that we have delivered been very good, very high quality. Remember, it's a 67% product, low deleterious elements, so the quality or certainly been a hit. They're very pleased with the progress in terms of the operation. Clearly, it's a challenging market, and the team is working on what they've got to do to make sure we remain competitive in the market. And that's what the Kumba conversation and the Ministry of conversation, but very pleased with the progress that Paul and team knowledge there've been some good work. 
On the project side, this is Seamus. I think Seamus last week we hold through the underground workings, so it's ahead of schedule. It's on budget, so very pleased with the progress. You will see when we do -- when I talk about Driving Value that we've now put it in as a potential contributor in 2016. It wasn't in our early numbers, but they've done a good job. I'm certainly very pleased with the progress. We're commissioning Bell of the stubble of his the. It will make a number of contribution in 2016 as well. On the diamond side, minus 55 degrees. The looks like it's good, so the biggest risk to the project was getting supplies pretty looks like it's been navigated so, so far, so good. I don't want to put the marker on you, I'm just saying that at the moment it looks pretty good. The one disappointing area and I won't overplay it, but we did find is the licensing process at Cerrejón with our other 2 joint ventures through the management company was a bit tougher than anticipated, which is something we've seen right through South America. You will see that we haven't nominated a contribution on the project for driving value. But we have found, though, Seamus and the team with our colleagues in the asset have identified operating improvements that will likely make contribution in the operating asset improvement area as opposed to the project area. So for me, that's still a good outcome and some lessons to be learned in the licensing, but other parts of the project have all gone to plan. 
With that, I'll hand across to Mr. Midori."

Thank you very much, Mark, always very helpful. He's an engineer. I'm an economist. Okay, good morning, everybody. First, in the highlights of the dividend. We maintain the final dividend that $0.53. We are fully committed to our dividend",815,"The other one. Thank you very much, Mark, always very helpful. He's an engineer. I'm an economist. Okay, good morning, everybody. 
First, in the highlights of the dividend. We maintain the final dividend that $0.53. We are fully committed to our dividend policy, which is to maintain or increase the dividend through the cycle. In terms of earnings, 17% decline of earnings compared to 25% decline in EBIT. That's due to the business mix. De Beers contributed in excess of 40% of the group earnings in 2014 compared to 20% in the prior year. You remember the way we account for one-off, the joint venture in Botswana. We consolidated this one on an after-tax basis, so that reduced the reported tax rate. 
In terms of tax rate for the current year, 2015, we expect tax rate between 30% and 32%. We also reported an impairment of $3.9 billion. I flagged this potential impairment at the December Investor Day. I think it was to answer a questions from you, Jason. $3.9 billion, quickly for Minas-Rio. As you know, we are completed the project ahead of the revised schedule, and we also announced that the total CapEx will be $400 million lower than the revised number, so no change from an operational standpoint. It's all driven by lower commodity prices, lower iron ore price in the short but also our expectation in the medium to long term. 
Both CapEx and net debt, just slightly better than the guidance we gave you back here in December. And return on capital employed, 8%. At constant, June 2013, price that 10%, so similar to 2013, again at constant prices. 
Turning to the price variance for the first half. We reported a 3% decline in basket price. The price erosion accelerated in the second half, so 9% for the full year. That includes for the full year almost a $200 million mark-to-market adjustment for copper. At the end of December, we had 165,000 tonnes of copper provisioning price at $2.87, the current price around $2.57. There were some further price erosion since the beginning of the year. The basket price declined 3% again due to copper. There was also, as Mark mentioned, a further easing in diamond price in January. 
Turning to the EBIT variance. I already cover the price variance of $2.4 billion. FX, so the decline in currency -- in the countries in which we operate had a positive impact of $1.3 billion, $800 million around goes through the benefit of weaker Aussie dollar and Chilean pesos. 
Inflation, 5% on a weighted average for the group, again South Africa being the main contributor with the CPI in excess of 6%. Then you see the benefit of the operational improvement that Mark has covered, both the 4% increase in production or the copper HLR but also the 3% decline in nominal real prices. As the platinum strike impact $760 million. That's impact both during the strike as well as during the ramp-up period seen in the second half of 2014. 
Turning to CapEx. $6 billion CapEx in 2014. 2 main projects in '14. Minas-Rio, we spent $1.9 billion; and Russ Vin in met coal is $4.5 [ph] billion. You see the improvement in SIB CapEx, 10% decline due to $2 billion despite the condition increase of 4% that I mentioned earlier. 2015, we have revised our guidance slightly lower, so at the bottom of the range that we gave you in December. We expect CapEx of $5.2 billion in 2015. And you remember that I flagged that we'll have more flexibility in 2016 with the level of committed CapEx below $4 billion. 
Turning to the cash flow and debt level. In terms of cash flow and debt for 2014, negative cash flow of $2.2 billion after the payment of the dividend of $1.1 billion. For 2015, at spot prices, with the level of CapEx around $5.2 billion and the benefit of the disposal of Tarmac, we expect the level of debt to peak between $13.5 billion and $14 billion at the end of 2015. 
In 2016, again, at spot prices, we had a level of committed CapEx of below $4 billion. We expect to be cash neutral after the payment of the dividend. We also highlighted back in December level of liquidity at $15 billion at the end of December, and we expect to maintain this level of liquidity over the next 2 years, limiting refinancing both in '15 and '16, $1.7 billion in '15 and $1.6 billion in 2016. 
We are progressing the restructuring of the group portfolio. You are familiar with the progress on Tarmac. We expect to close the transaction, again subject to the main merger being approved between Holcim and Lafarge. We expect to complete the transaction before June 2015. We have also added 2 assets to our disposal program in Australia, and Foxleigh. 
Thank you."
409115,283684193,762233,"Anglo American plc, 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Completely expected you to jump in my notes up, Renée. Just to be respectful. Just a quick wrap. Firstly, Driving Value. Progress during the course of the year, you see the waterfall charts went well. Projects, we've actually delivered during the course",2136,"Completely expected you to jump in my notes up, Renée. Just to be respectful. Just a quick wrap. Firstly, Driving Value. Progress during the course of the year, you see the waterfall charts went well. Projects, we've actually delivered during the course of 2014. You'll notice that these top line targets have actually hardened up, and we're now on track to $4 billion. If you remember, we started at $3.4 billion. We have $500 million worth of projects that we believe we could bring through. They have now been identified most of them had plans actually put against them, and we still got some cleaning up to do, but pretty confident now on the $4 billion. We'll close that gap. If we take consensus prices, that's the difference between the original starting point. But I think beyond that conversation which you've seen, what we've done is I just put 3 overheads here to explain the projects that underpinned the business improvement numbers and give you a sense of the spot price sensitivity so that it'll help you reconcile where we're going and what we're doing. I think the most important point to make is that we're on track to deliver the restructuring targets that we set from the outset. That's the key point to make, and certainly, we think this will might help the conversation and people understanding where we're going. 
Minas-Rio, based on all the original parameters, will deliver on this targets. Boa Vista Fresh Rock will make a nominal contribution. And Barro Alto, in fact, is probably going to do a little bit better than we thought, but we still kept at the $100 million that we nominated, which was the furnace rebuild a better contribution but the great thing about Barro Alto the encouraging thing is that we're able to pull 30% out of the cost to make significant improvements even with the furnaces in the condition they're in, so that's been a positive. So we're on track to deliver our project targets the $900 million that we originally set. Sorry, I should make a point that, that number really gives you a sense of the impact of prices on the project delivery component. 
The asset improvements, and again, I'm not going to go through these just to let you know that we're the broad buckets where we're tracking. We are now -- we said net-net, net of headwinds, we would have delivered $1.2 billion. It's now looking more like $1.6 billion, which take some of the $500 million that we've identified into hardboard project in the improvement. Now if you go back to my business-by-business analysis, if you look at the green, which is the operating performance improvement; and the red, which is a headwind, we net those 2 together to come up with this bottom line table, so we net the 2. So Renée's operating contribution, where you saw $700 million, is net of the positive operating improvements and the headwinds, for example, the coppers headwind that will help reconcile those numbers. And again, if any questions, Paul and the team will just guide you through that. Particularly clear where we see the opportunities. In terms of those things that are now being worth so in terms of the hardwiring of timing and schedules, the improvements based on what we see and the good work Norman and the team have done, Seamus and the guys, every day is about finding another dollar. Copper, Duncan and the team are working very hard at all the pieces they're putting together. And Philippe and the team working right across the portfolio to improve margins. All very important and all pretty good. And again, sorry, I should point out the impact of the pricing assumptions just to give you a reconciling point. 
On this side, which is the Driving Value, value leakage. We've already polled $330 million out of that part of that program. We'll certainly do better than the $300 million, but we're holding $300 million at the moment. On supply chain, somewhere we can still some work to do. Until we get the full 2016 target. We have set up new strategic relationships, Joy, Caterpillar, Komatsu and others just work through the process, but certainly some goods indication. This one, we will point to, if I could just make one simple observation. Better than 2.7% or 3% above our reference price, the performance in the commercial team has been exceptional in terms of driving value. We've got the hardwired number we compared to and it's certainly making a very good contribution, so really pleased with the progress of Peter and the team. We remain low key because it's always that one that some people a little bit skeptical. But against our reference prices, they've made significant improvements in ground. I spent time, Peter, myself over in Asia talking to our customers, and the different approach we're taking with a customer's is certainly been appreciated and we're seeing it across-the-board. That will move around a little bit depending on the market the circumstance and prices going down. You tend to get that a bit more of a benefit, but against our peers and our targets are above with our peers talking to when they talk reference price, we're doing very well. We're very happy with the progress made and the Singapore team has been a big very good well. On overheads of still a lot more to be done. This year is a big as we roll through the restructuring. Kumba, you're aware of. Norman has already started in January, certainly reductions and another certain to come. He's done 189 [ph] so he's running to the progress. He's got 2 months up and then he find the next level of change. That's going on right across the business, so that's one of those things you keep working through the pulled the numbers down, so we expect to hit the 500 target. So across-the-board, we target at $1.5 billion, which is on what we said before. And the pricing impact of that is negligible because of on the cost side. So you should get full value so that work and we're making good progress. 
In terms of risks, the one thing I think we should always do is flag through where we see the risks. These are industry risks in many cases, and there are specific risks with us across the portfolio. I just to let you know what we're doing. In terms of asset disposals, for us, it's strategic. The reason we're pruning back the size of the portfolio, there are a number of assets that aren't making contribution and, in fact, the assets we're targeting for us have made a relatively modest contribution to EBIT. And certainly, from a life-of-mine perspective, they're not going to be the assets to move the dial. That's why we're selling the business, and that's why we won't be pressed to sell something if it's not the reasonable value. But at the same time, we're not going to argue about the last dollar because it's just strategic play, not about the simple dollars. And so for us, that's -- we're going well on as René indicated on Tarmac. The issue for as well be across other parts abruptly. We've been a number of offers some very encouraging, some not terribly good. For us, probably likely path we will be the listing option in platinum, but we do have cash offers on the table, so it's a matter of how those 2 will compare up over the next few months. But certainly, by midyear, Chris will be pretty clearly knowing where he's going, making good progress on that. Same for copper, same for coal. We added 2 assets, which we've been taking about for sometime. Seamus and the team went through the whole analysis, very happy that, that's the right thing to do with those assets in the portfolio. In terms of ROCE, South America in the midst of a 5-year drop. You've got shortages of water in Chile, in Brazil as well, and so all companies are going to have to manage access to water very carefully. We've already identified alternative sources. We've already got a range of things that Duncan and the team have put in place to protect the Collahuasi, Los Bronces that's happening across-the-board. We've got other additional contingencies in residual I guess the message I'd say is if you hold portfolios that have got asset in South America, it's a good question of asking what are you doing about water across the portfolio. For us, it's very important. We're working hard to make sure that we minimize any impact, if there are any. 
Power in South Africa, again, most of you know. We do have flexibility within each of our operations, but there's a limit to that flexibility. Working with the government, certainly, there's a sensitivity in the government to make sure that industry is not starved for power and create more financial pressure. But it's one that we're watching very carefully and working with the government to make sure that the got options in place. And all the things we can do internally within the business with our own emergency generation to the people up and help the situation and that's an ongoing conversation. But again, generally, we've traveled through the last few months pretty well, but the country is tight, and so we're watching that carefully. And finally, right across the globe, mining life is a big issue. The sustainability conversation, the relationship you have with local governments is absolutely critical. It's strategic, and it's one that we're certainly talking a lot of interest in to make sure that we don't have major surprises in the business. 
Not going to do a summary. If we just finish off with key deliverables. Ministry -- we want to see that at least 80% capacity by year-end. That will put us in a place to deliver our 26.5 target for 2016. That's where Paul and the team are very focused and at the right costs. We've got the opportunity to keep working those cost now. That's what Paul is doing. He will be, in parallel, implementing the new operating model as he commissions the site as well, so he's going to work on both sides of the question. 
Portfolio, Renée talked about, the other assets are in process. We've only taken into account that the Lafarge, Tarmac this year in terms of our numbers, we do expect the bulk of things to be finished off by the end of '16, but again, the only caveat there is we are not any far, so we're not pressed. We've manage the balance sheet every dollar we put out of the operations are certainly having a 2 to 3x effect on the debt that we're reporting, and that's where the big focus is, but we'll work those sites of the street. Operating model, the key is to get this out faster. The benefits that we've seen in coal, at Sishen are now being taken on and rolled out to other parts of the business. Chris, Duncan, Norman and other parts of Kolomela, they've have already picked up the key elements and are cherrypicking and supporting improvements in their operations, plus our team is making good progress. So it's had a much broader impact, so there are the areas that we're focusing on in the next 12 months. And for us, as I said, in managing mining inflation in South Africa, it's not simply about mining smarter and efficiency. It's about structural change and efficiencies. And for us, productivity is a keyword in South Africa. Norman has already made announcements about what he's doing, head office overheads, his efficiencies and the improvement he's made. He's already made the 10% improvement on his unit operating cost. There's more to be had. That's where he's focused with the team. In platinum, the restructuring of the business so that we ultimately come down to Mogalakwena [indiscernible] as the core of the asset, dominating the left-hand side of the cost curve. Mogalakwena 45% margin on des prices today. It will be a very different business within 2 to 3 years. And thermal coal, the early signs in the rollout of the operating model we've seen very good improvements in productivity. In particular, we've seen big increases in equipment performance, which is something we want to roll out more broadly in South Africa. And we'll learn from what we're doing here and then take that into other parts of business and vice versa. So big push this year in getting south African cost back in control and running certainly significantly lower than those normal inflation rates. 
With that, we're very happy to take questions."

Going the other way, we are -- the benefit from production standpoint or the recovery at Kumba and we refinish the level of inventory in Kumba. So flat on inventory side. On the side, it was a reduction of $400 million, both the pricing reduction, which is what you saw I guess yesterday with Rio, but also there was highly debtors at Kumba at the end of 2013.

I think the mining companies that have done well long term of those companies that have worked the resources to their potential, I think that's we're the big opportunity is for Anglo American.

Clearly, the work is going on in getting the scope of the resource both for Collahuasi and Los Bronces.

Everything we done today suggests we've got a much bigger resource potential. I want won't put numbers for it. That would be inappropriate at this stage. But certainly, how we can work those through being off there. I think water is the key issue. And as you know, we're doing environmental work on [indiscernible] which is adjacent to Los Bronces and also during the regional exploration. So both are in the early phases, and certainly, we're not in a position to say this or that. But by the end of this year, in our December review, we'll give you much better shape in terms of both of those in terms of direction in travel and what the key issues will be in taking those assets up to their potential. On specifically, I think, first, we got to say good progress on the feasibility work and the project development strategy. We certainly enhanced the project in many ways. I'm very pleased with the progress that's been made. The project will go to the board in June for review. The challenges we have, as you all know, is around copper price in the market, so those issues will be taking into account. Our approach in any investment of this type will be to syndicate the project, so all of the things we said from a strategic point of view hold. And from our point of view, I think it's important to acknowledge unlike many projects that are being talked about, we've got tremendous support from the government at the Federal level, the regional level and the local community. So we've done all the work at all the right levels to position the project. The key will be the market and how we assess things going forward in terms of what we can do and we'll have discussions with the board midyear.

On Minas-Rio, I mean it's still early in decommissioning. We said 33 to 35 operating cost. About 70% of our cost are denominated in real. 30% -- I think at USD 72.28. We've obviously got a big kick out on freight. So our delivery costs are well under 55, well over 50 actually based on current costs. Paolo and the team seized some opportunities to improve the cost base, but we're not going to change the 33 to 35 until he's got 6 to 9 months under his build on commissioning. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. By the year-end, we'll give you a good look on our way we think we're it is. We still think the operating model has got a lot of possibilities, but at the same time, I think early the forecasts on real. I think 2.7, a few weeks back, it was 2.3, 2.4. So there's a fair bit of movement. And so we'll stick with the current guidance until we've got some hard stuff see we're going to do much better.

The question is whether when we will approve it, when we will go ahead. But in any case, we will this project. So as we sell down, we expect we'll be able to monetize some of the value. We should offset any additional CapEx if we decide to go ahead in 2016."

And from our point of view, that's been taken into account in the way we've put the numbers forward. As René said, we would syndicate and decision to go forward would go with the syndication decision, which would manage our capital inside the targets that we've talked to. Other projects will have to then run the gamut of the market and the discipline and the targets we set for ourselves as a business. I still think there's improvement available in our ongoing capital spend. We've improved our capital efficiency more than 10%. I still think there's a lot more there in certain areas. Other areas have done pretty well pulling their capital down. So from our point of view, I think there's a lot more we can do on capital, albeit there's been some really good guide. So if I could make the point, you're not going to see a major capital blowout in this organization. We're going to be prudent, careful, but we're also going to make sure that we're making decisions for the long-term benefit of the business. And so, if it's the right decision to go forward, what we'll do is we'll think about the syndication is a way the financing it and protecting our flexibility as the business and making the right call. Can I go here to be here and then -- Then I'm going to pick up South Africa as well. Yes."

We said very clearly that the government we were looking to reduce because the domestic supply lines are generally smaller scale, shorter life, so from our point of view, just dialing down our position over time. The government was actually quite supportive of that conversation because they're looking for more than 51% for supplies. So their point of view line with what they wanted to see. So we originally started the conversation that's a strategic position. If someone were to come in and offer us something to step right back, then we'd be open to that conversation. And we're certainly not out there canvassing. We'll see what comes in. The current situation, no difference, no change for our strategy, and it's been a constructive open conversation and we seen no major barbs on that. Key issue, make sure that whatever comes in can deliver on this social level playing commitments, appropriate level of transformation in terms of the mining charter, and beyond that, it's a commercial transaction. It is a free country Constitution. You do what you do appropriately and treat us with respect. That's it. In terms of the head office restructuring, I mean you got to be a bit careful. When we look at overhead, we look at any board that's not on a side touching the product. And we've been restructuring the overheads right across the group. I think reductions in London are over 150. We're continuing reductions, but we are moving things around. We're closing offices. For example, we've closed São Paulo. We've closed a number of offices around the globe as we've consolidated our base metals business in Brazil. Duncan's been rationalizing his copper regional structures. Seamus, I think, was 350 reduction, Seamus, between Australia and South Africa. That's the last I think this is the fifth time you've gone through so it's really squeezing it down. London, we are consolidating some technical functions. And Seamus, for example, is now sitting in London hurting because of the price of properties in the country. But so we've started that we're continuing on the program, we'll continue through the year in terms of production. So if I look across the broad, the broad spectrum, we're about 20% and continuing. For us, you'll see that we're down 40% on the numbers. And by the end of the year, we'll be at a $500 million run rate, and we expect to go beyond that as we look at the impact of disposals on the structures as well, which will go into 2016. So it will be continuing across the globe. Okay. Can we take a call from South Africa? Paul, I'm not sure. Okay, good."

Gareth [ph], I'm looking at you. All right, thanks. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us here today.
If I were to talk to industry themes that we've all been hearing about the last few weeks and, in particular, probably the last few days, you will have heard commodity prices, capital discipline and returns, restructuring and costs. I'm going to say that you'll hear a bit more of that during the course of my conversation. And I would hope that those here representing shareholders will see that we remain absolutely focused on delivering total shareholder returns.
In terms of Anglo American, in the last 5 quarters, we've talked about delivering, and we have delivered on commitments. We've actually consistently increased our operations guidance, and we've consistently been cutting our capital. You will be in the same conversation, albeit coming off the December results. There's not going to be that much difference in the last 2 months in terms of what we've done, but again, we're continuing to tighten up the business. And if I could say in a very somber way, it's a tough market. In terms of the work we've done, we've positioned ourselves to continue to improve, but I would say there's still a lot more to be done. And in our view, the markets will probably remain very tough for the next 1 to 2 years. The real judge for us or the real challenge for us is to make sure that, when the market does come back our way, we've done all the right things to ensure that we pick it up and go forward in a positive and constructive way and that we don't miss the lessons that had needed to be learned coming into the situation we're in. And I think, in going through the conversations, the most important point for me to make is, as an organization and in particular with our strategy and our focal points on performance, that's something we're determined we don't miss as a leadership team. And certainly, that's a constant conversation with the board given where we've been, given where we are today and given where we're determined to go in terms of the future.
I will and we will, René and myself, be presenting. We will be relatively quick in moving through the data. We just come off a fairly long session in December, and so from our point of view, we don't see much point in going back through the ground you already know. What we want to do is trying to give you more opportunity to ask questions about what you see as being the critical issues in the business. So from that point of view, we'll move through fairly quickly, fairly briskly. If we don't pick up something during the course of the presentation, be very open to pick it up in Q&A and then follow with our roundtable so it gives you more of an opportunity to ask questions and hear our thoughts on the business from the things that you see as being important.
I will start up with conversation around the meat and potatoes part of the business. So without fanfare, we'll talk about quickly EBIT, $4.9 billion, down 25%, obviously impacted by lower prices and the platinum strike. I will talk about the impact on platinum a little bit later and, if we adjust for what that meant for the business, how we've performed against across the portfolio. In going through the clean numbers, and you will have seen those numbers, and we'll pick these points up. And René in particular will dissect those numbers in more detail, so I won't go through that any further than to say the net debt number, $12.9 billion is about $1.8 billion less than we thought it would be when we were thinking forward 12 months ago. It reflects improvement in operating performance, tight control of capital, delivery on projects ahead of schedule and under cost. And it reflects a real focus on making sure that we could control those things we can control. There is some timing issues on capital but not significant. That's been achieved despite a tough pricing environment that we've experienced right across the portfolio, but from our point of view, that's been a very important number. And as a consequence of being able to manage the balance sheet in those exposures, we've been able to maintain the dividend. And we're confident, with what we're doing and where we are even with this price environment, that we'll manage that and continue to deliver on our commitments both in terms of debt targets and dividend.
From an operations perspective across the business. Sishen delivered 15% above plan. And at the same time, you will see that our waste numbers were a bit, a little bit less than what we were targeting. But if you remember, halfway through the year, we said we've stripped 10% out of the long ""life of mine to waste"" schedule. So the waste that was moved is consistent with the new operating plan, and the business is on track to deliver its ore targets for 2015 and 2016. And we've increased our ore production guidance for 2016. So Norman and the guys have done some good work. 2015 is going to be a big year still, but good performance across those targets, with more to be done.
Minas-Rio, not much else to be said, 2 months early -- ahead of schedule, rather, 2 months early; $400 million lower than the schedule. Platinum restructure, on track, divestment process underway. I'll talk a little about that a little bit later, and René will pick up divestments.
Copper and nickel both turned around, very happy with the progress that's been made. I won't say much else about nickel later in the presentation. Just to make a comment that we've more than doubled production from where we started. We've cut 30% out of the cost. The furnace rebuild, that started on the day we said it would, and we're tracking ahead of the schedule. So very pleased there.
And De Beers, good work in the markets. The one thing that really pleases me is the operating improvements we've seen in De Beers, and I will pick that up a little bit later.
So generally, delivery on all of our major commitments, pretty happy with the progress but a lot more to be done.
Safety, key measure for us in any environment. Obviously, no one's ever going to accept 1 fatality in any business, so for us, the loss of 6 colleagues is a tragedy and is something that we deeply feel. Having said that, we're pleased with the progress reducing fatality rates by 60%. The single, most significant improvement in 1 year in the group's history, best set of safety results we've ever delivered: a 25% reduction in our total frequency rate. When you go back to the fatality number, if you remember, in 2014, we had 1 incident where we lost 6 colleagues. So if I compared safety incidents or fatal incidents to fatal incidents, our improvement is more like 40%, still solid but it's closer to that 25% to 30% improvement across the accidents. I think that's a fair reflection of the progress we've made. And so still a lot more work to be done on safety, but we're pleased with the progress so far.
On the environmental side, again, we're focused on all aspects of the business. When we present our results, we make sure we touch each of the key cornerstone positions and things we're focused on. Our events, which are spills or emissions to the environment, down to 15. Seamus and the guys have done a lot of work in the coal business, and this was about flooding events across a number of jurisdictions. So big improvements, still more to be done.
I guess, when you look at our sustainable approach in environment, community relationships and the broader stakeholder relationships, if you go to any index across the industry, we're usually 1 of the top 3, as we should be. For us, it's strategic. The world is becoming a tougher place. You have to have the right relationships. You don't want to wake up in the morning and find out that your business have been stopped because you haven't got the right relationships. Again, we remain focused. And for us, this is a key metric and one that we talk about consistently with all other parts of the business.
From an operations perspective, we've made good progress across the portfolio. Each business, compared to 2013, has improved. I do make the comment that, from a platinum point of view, obviously we've adjusted for the strike. All of those operations that continued through the strike were 3% above where they were last year. And we were able to deliver on all of our contractual commitments, so that was important. Chris and team saw the potential for a strike, and we said we were going to stand our ground and make sure that the outcome was a sustainable outcome. It certainly was tougher than we thought it would be, but we did stand our ground.
And in copper, I think Duncan is sensitive to how that appears on that overhead. You've got to remember that he's eaten a 7% reduction in head grades, so in terms of throughputs, he's up almost 10%. He's got longer leads, and he's moving more waste. And so the performance on an underlying basis have been very strong. And in fact, he's 7% above his guidance numbers as well. So we're very pleased with the progress, albeit the actual headline volumes are down. So across the board, significant improvement across the business. I think this is the first time that we've outperformed across the portfolio certainly in the last 10 years, and that's driven the outperformance on budget and guidance numbers.
In terms of unit operating costs, as people know, we're really focused on margins. And obviously, cost is something we can control aggressively.
If I start with the challenges. Inflation, South Africa, the big challenge for us as a business across the portfolio, around about 5%. In local dollar terms, our costs were 2% above where we were in 2013. In terms of real performance, we've reduced our costs by around 3% -- I don't know what I've done there. Oh, there we go.
We've reduced our costs by about 3%. The big challenge in South Africa and, for us, Kumba, coal and platinum have each got structural changes in process to turn those trends around so that we're reducing our costs in local dollar terms. And I'll talk about that when we do the quick analysis on each of the business. And in copper terms, as I said, we've had the grade, plus the increasing waste, movements. On a real basis, the copper team, I think we're about 5% down, Duncan, in real terms. So some progress but more to be done.
And we don't try and take the credit of the U.S. dollars. Many will just report the U.S. dollars. We think it's appropriate to report our nominal figures so you know what we're trying to do to turn those trends around. And quite frankly, the U.S. dollar will be what it will be. Just to report the final number: We're down around 5% across the portfolio in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar.
Lots more work to be done on cost, certainly made good progress but a lot more to be done. We haven't bought these costs. That is, we haven't thrown massive amounts of capital at this performance. In some businesses, you will see significant capital and volume increase of capital. This is about improving the business and improving the controllables we have without throwing capital. So we pulled our capital back at the same time. So a lot more work to be done, good progress but more to be done.
On a broader basis, and René will pick these up, you'll see the ""business area by business area"" variations. De Beers, I'll talk about a little bit later. Both cost and operating improvements are underpinning a very good result there. The one thing I did want to say, though, in terms of our thesis for a diversified miner being the ability to manage through the cycle and through various commodity cycles, we should be, in the long term, in a more robust position. Certainly, 2014 prices bore that out. Again, if I adjust for the platinum strike, our drop in earnings of 25% would have been 14%. That puts us top in class across the majors in terms of dealing with the overall price big drop over the 12 months. We should be doing better than that, in our view, in terms of managing costs. We've made good progress, but we need to do more. But certainly, that was, I thought, a pretty important chart. And again, René will give you another spaghetti chart that pulls across all of the commodities to give you a sense of what each one's done.
In terms of the unit analysis. Kumba dominated, obviously, price effects and inflation variations in terms of the earnings. We also increased our waste volumes. The good news is, for Norman and the team, that the unit costs that were reduced for tonne moved, which is about 10%, actually offset the increase in waste costs. So there's been a good -- there's been good work on unit costs, but there's a lot more to be done. And Norman and the team, through the course of this year, will be working overheads and their efficiencies and their unit costs in driving out the operating model across the full business. Where they have put the operating model in place, they're seeing improvements in efficiency of around 30%. They are seeing in some areas 60% improvements, but that's more about equipment and other factors that have been done. We try and separate the improvements so we understand what's working, what's not working.
From a waste movement perspective, as I said, because we've changed the actual configuration that the pit would drop waste out in the longer term, our waste movements have dropped a little. It does shorten the life by about 18 months, so it's not significant, but it does front-end load the value or certainly improves the front-end loading of the value and certainly worthwhile in terms of the business.
Big focus this year will be to continue the waste movement, make sure that we're opening up the ore to deliver the tonnes for this year; and the 38 million tonne, which is an upgrade on the 37 million tonne that we forecast this time last year.
On coal, again significant improvement in the costs, and I think we're at about 16% or 17% costs on an apples-for-apples basis. I think Grasstree is probably the #1 longwall in the country now, Seamus? We did have some challenges at Moranbah with some hydraulic ram challenges that'll take us probably till mid-year to sort through and change that, yes, so it's going to take a bit of time. We also had some geotechnical issues. We've got through the worst of the longwall areas, but we will pick that back up.
Very pleased with their performance. And in particular, this has been hard-nosed focused on efficiency, reducing costs: overheads, regional, operations, the restructuring of Dawson, the restructuring of Foxleigh, the pulling of costs back in the Hunter Valley. So significant performance improvement across the board. We are now a low-quartile-cost producer in the global metallurgical coal business with one of the best metallurgical qualities in the world, so certainly improving. We've now there -- I think, we're #1 and #3 in the longwall rankings in Australia as well, so we've certainly outperformed our peers in those areas that you can compare apples with apples. And I think Seamus and the team have done some great work.
In copper. Now if you'll remember, from 2012 to 2013, we went from 660,000 tonnes after the problems in the pits with mine development. Duncan and the team have turned that back around last year, in particular with a very strong second half. We delivered 770,000 tonne. This year, I think we're at about just a tad under 750,000. We knew there was grade and waste headwinds that they were traveling into, but they've still continued to improve the operation with a 7% improvement, 7% to 10% improvement, depending on where you are, on throughputs. Remember also that, when the grade drops at Los Bronces, we've had a big impact. So the underlying performance has been strong.
We've consolidated the recovery. The pits are in proper sequence, and they set up to continue to improve performance. The one caveat or the risk, I think, that we need to flag, and we did do this in December, is Chile is still in drought. It remains a risk, and in fact, it was impacting our operating performance in November and December. And so there's a whole range of things we've put in place, and I'll pick it up as a broader risk for the business and for the industry, quite frankly, later in the presentation. So good progress, still a lot more work to be done.
And certainly, Collahuasi and Los Bronces are really clear assets for us longer term, and the improvements continue.
In the platinum business, the strike dominates. I'll just do with some good news and then come back to the strike. In terms of those assets, they've continued to operate 3% above budget, doing pretty well, Mogalakwena in particular up to 370,000 ounces. So Chris and the team were able to find some additional process capacity. The mine certainly got the capacity to do that, plus, and so I think some good work there. And as you know, Mogalakwena got a 45% cash margin. Before, they're 2% in this price environment but doing very well. And the progress on the pit looks good. And if you look at almost every quarter, there's been a step change in efficiency and delivery at Mogalakwena. And certainly, the guys are making every post a winner. So good performance.
But clear now for us is to continue to bed the operation down, settle the relationships, drive the efficiencies and continue on with the disposal program. Clearly, that will create some tension in some of the conversations. The most important thing is we're ahead on the rationalization -- or the restructuring, I should say. We're ahead on the restructuring in terms of reducing numbers, making good progress, but we're going to have to tiptoe carefully as we manage all the clear relationships over the next 12 months. But again, really pleased with the progress the guys have made and how well they've done since coming back from the strike.
On De Beers, modest price improvements during the course of the year; obviously, the market a bit softer towards the end of the year and into the new year, certainly not something that we're panicking about. It is what we'd expect to see in terms of the market. The good news for us, I guess, from an operations perspective is that improvement there, which is Jwaneng is up 10%. Costs are down 10%. Orapa's down -- or up in terms of volume, down in terms of costs. And we found a lot more resources and reserves at Orapa. So that's the really encouraging piece. So some really good work at De Beers and if you then add the benefits of integration, the reduction in overheads, certainly some improvements. And again, more to be done but encouraging progress.
Minas-Rio, 2 months early, $400 million. Today, as we stand with exchange rates and everything else moving around, we're under $50 a tonne landed in Asia. Still a lot more work to be done, but we're very pleased with the rate of progress in the commissioning. We are seeing the usual problems, ""If [indiscernible], what are we going to do with our drill and blast?"" They're the normal things you see, but the progress has been very good.
We've loaded 8 ships. I was actually in China the day before our first shipment arrived with one of our customers. The feedback we've had on the ships that we have delivered have been very good, very high quality. If we remember, it's a 67% product, low deleterious elements, so the quality has certainly been a hit. And I'm very pleased with the progress in terms of the operation.
Clearly, it's a challenging market, and the team is working on what they've got to do to make sure we remain competitive in the market. And that's both a Kumba conversation and a Minas-Rio conversation, but very pleased with the progress that Paulo and the team [indiscernible] have some good work.
On the projects side. Grosvenor, this is Seamus's tunnel borer. I think, Seamus, last week, we held through to the underground workings, so it's ahead of schedule. It's on budget, so very pleased with the progress. You will see, when we do -- when I talk about Driving Value, that we've now put it in as a potential contributor in 2016. It wasn't in our early numbers, but they've done a good job. I'm certainly very pleased with the progress.
We're commissioning Boa Vista. It will likely make a nominal contribution in 2016 as well. On the diamonds side, minus 55 degrees, the ice road looks like it's good. So the biggest risk to the project was getting supplies for the ice road. It looks like it's been navigated, so, so far, so good. I don't want to put the marker on you, Philippe. So I'm just saying that, at the moment, it looks pretty good.
The one disappointing area, and I won't overplay it, but what we did find is the licensing process at Cerrejón with our other 2 joint ventures through the management company was a bit tougher than anticipated, which is something we've seen right through South America. You will see that we haven't nominated a contribution on the project, per Driving Value. What we have found, though, Seamus and the team, with our colleagues in the asset, have identified operating improvements that will likely make a contribution in the operating asset improvement area, as opposed to the project area. So for me, that's still a good outcome and some lessons to be learned on the licensing, but other parts of the project have all gone to plan.
With that, I'll hand across to Mr. Midori."

Okay, good morning, everybody.
First in the highlights, the dividend. We maintain the final dividend at $0.53. We are fully committed to our dividend policy, which is to maintain or increase the dividend through the cycle.
In term of earnings, a 17% decline of earnings compared to a 25% decline in EBIT. That's due to the business mix. De Beers contributed in excess of 40% of the group earnings in 2014 compared to 20% in the prior year. You'll remember the way we account for Debswana, the joint venture in Botswana. We consolidate Debswana on an after-tax basis, so that reduced the reported tax rate. In term of tax rate for the current year, 2015, we expect tax rate between 30% and 32%.
We also reported an impairment of $3.9 billion. I flagged this potential impairment at the December Investor Day. I think it was answering a question from you, Jason, $3.9 billion, predominantly for Minas-Rio. As you know, we have completed the project ahead of the revised schedule, and we also announced that the total CapEx will be $400 million lower than the revised number, so no change from an operational standpoint. It's all driven by lower commodity prices, lower iron ore price in the short but also our expectation in the medium to long term.
Both CapEx and net debt, just slightly better than the guidance we gave you back here in December. And return on capital employed, 8%; at constant June 2013 price deck, 10%, so similar to 2013, again at constant prices.
Turning to the price variance. So for the first half, we reported a 3% decline in basket price. The price erosion accelerated in the second half, so 9% for the full year. That includes for the full year almost a $200 million mark-to-market adjustment for copper. At the end of December, we had 165,000 tonne of copper provisioning priced at $2.87, and the current price is around $2.57. There was some further price erosion since the beginning of the year. And the basket price declined 3%, again due to copper. There was also, as Mark mentioned, a further easing in diamond price in January.
Turning to the EBIT variance. So I already covered the price variance of $2.4 billion. FX, so the decline in currency in the countries in which we operate, had a positive impact of $1.3 billion, $800 million through to the round. We also got the benefit of a weaker Aussie dollar and Chilean pesos. Inflation, 5% on a weighted average for the group, again South Africa being the main contributor with a CPI in excess of 6%.
Then you see the benefit of the operational improvement that Mark has covered, both the 4% increase in production or that copper equivalent but also the 3% decline in nominal real prices. And then the platinum strike impact of $760 million, so that's impact both during the strike as well as during the ramp-up period seen in the second half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx, $6 billion CapEx in 2014. 2 main projects in '14: Minas-Rio, we spent $1.9 billion; and Grosvenor in met coal Australia, $0.5 billion. You see the improvement in SIB CapEx, a 10% decline to $2 billion despite the production increase of 4% that I mentioned earlier.
2015, we have revised our guidance slightly lower, so at the bottom of the range that we gave you in December. We expect CapEx of $5.2 billion in 2015. And you remember that I flagged that we'll have more flexibility in 2016, with the level of committed CapEx below $4 billion.
Turning to the cash flow and debt level. In term of cash flow and debt for 2014, negative cash flow of $2.2 billion after the payment of the dividend of $1.1 billion.
For 2015, at spot prices, with the level of CapEx around $5.2 billion and the benefit of the disposal of Tarmac, we expect the level of debt to peak between $13.5 billion and $14 billion at the end of 2015. In 2016, again, at spot prices and with at the level of committed CapEx of below $4 billion, we expect to be cash neutral after the payment of the dividend.
We also highlighted back in December the level of liquidity of $15 billion at end of December, and we expect to maintain this level of liquidity over the next 2 years; limited refinancing both in '15 and '16, $1.7 billion in '15 and $1.6 billion in 2016.
We are progressing the restructuring of the group portfolio. You are familiar with the progress on Tarmac. We expect to close the transaction, again subject to the main merger being approved between Holcim and Lafarge. We expect to complete the transaction before June 2015. We have also added 2 assets to our disposal program in Australia: Dawson and Foxleigh.
Thank you."

You've seen the waterfall chart. I won't dwell. Projects, what we've actually deliver",2199,"I completely expected you to jumble my notes up, René, just to be respectful.
Just a quick wrap, guys.
Firstly, Driving Value, progress during the course of the year. You've seen the waterfall chart. I won't dwell. Projects, what we've actually delivered during the course of 2014. You'll notice that these top line targets have actually hardened up, and we're now on track for $4 billion. If we remember, we started at $3.4 billion. We had $500 million worth of projects that we believe we could bring through. They've now been identified. Most of them have had plans actually put against them. And we've still got some cleaning up to do but pretty confident now on the $4 billion. So it'll close that gap.
If we take consensus prices, that's the difference between the original starting point. But I think, beyond that conversation which you've seen, what we've done is I've just put 3 overheads here to explain the projects that underpin the business improvement numbers and give you a sense of the spot price sensitivity so that it'll help you reconcile where we're going and what we're doing. I think the most important point to make is that we're on track to deliver the restructuring targets that we set from the outset. That's the key point to make. And certainly, we think this will, might help the conversation and people understanding where we're going.
Minas-Rio, based on all the original parameters, will deliver on its targets. Boa Vista Fresh Rock will make a nominal contribution. And Barro Alto, in fact, is probably going to do a little bit better than we thought, but we still kept it at the $100 million that we nominated, which was the furnace rebuild as being better contribution. But the great thing about Barro Alto or the encouraging thing is that we're able to pull 30% out of the costs, make significant improvements even with the furnaces in the condition they're in. So that's been the positive.
So we're on track to deliver on our project targets, the $900 million that we originally set. Sorry, I should make a point that, that number there gives you a sense of the impact of prices on the project delivery component.
The asset improvements, and again I'm not going to go through these, just to let you know that, where the broad buckets were, where we're tracking, we are now, we said, net-net -- net of headwinds, we would have delivered $1.2 billion. It's now looking more like $1.6 billion, which takes some of the $500 million that we identified into hardboard projects in the improvement. Now if you go back to my business-by-business analysis, if you look at the green, which is the operating performance improvement; and the red, which is a headwind, we net those two together to come up with this bottom line table. So we net the two.
So René's operating contribution, where you saw $700 million, is net of the positive operating improvements and the headwinds, for example, that coppers headwind. That will help reconcile those numbers. And again, if there's any questions, Paul and the team will just guide you through that. So pretty clear where we see the opportunities.
In terms of those things that are now being worked through in terms of the hardwiring of timing and schedules. The column now are [ph] improvements based on what we see and the good work Norman and the team have done. Seamus and the guys, every day, is about finding another dollar. Copper, Duncan and the team working very hard on all of the pieces they're putting together and Philippe and the team working right across the portfolio to improve margins. All very important and all pretty good. And again, sorry, I should point out the impact of the pricing assumptions, just to give you a reconciling point.
On this side, which is the Driving Value, value leakage. We've already pulled $330 million out of that part of the program. We'll certainly do better than the $300 million, but we're holding it at $300 million at the moment. On supply chain, some early gains, still some work to do to get the full 2016 target. We have set up new strategic relationships, Joy, Caterpillar, Komatsu and others, just working through the process now but certainly some good indications.
This one, we will point to if I could just make one simple observation: better than 2.7%, almost 3% above our reference price, the performance in the commercial team has been exceptional in terms of Driving Value. We've got a hardwired number we compared to and it's certainly making a very good contribution, so really pleased with the progress with Peter and the team. We remain low key because it's always that one that some people are a little bit skeptical, but against our reference prices, they've made significant improvements in ground. I spend time, Peter and myself, over in Asia talking to our customers. And the different approach we're taking with our customers has certainly been appreciated, and we're seeing it across the board. That will move around a little bit depending on the market and the circumstance and prices going down. You tend to get a little bit more of a benefit, but against our peers and our targets, we're above what our peers have been talking to when they talk reference price. We're doing very well and very happy with the progress made. And the Singapore team has done very well.
On overheads, a lot more to be done. This year is a big year for us as we roll through the restructuring. Kumba, you're aware of. Norman has already started in January, 70 reductions, another 70 to come. He's done only Section 189, so he's rolling through the progress. He's got the team on the side identifying the next level of change. That's going on right across the business, and it's one of those things you keep working it through to pull the numbers down, so we expect to hit the $500 million target.
So across the board, we target that $1.5 billion, which is up on what we've said before. And the pricing impact of that is negligible because it's on the cost side. So you should get full value for that work, and we're making good progress.
In terms of risks, the one thing I think we should always do is flag to you where we see the risks. These are industry risks, in many cases, and there are specific risks for us across the portfolio.
Just to let you know what we're doing. In terms of asset disposals, for us, it's strategic. The reason we're pruning back the size of the portfolio, there are a number of assets that aren't making a contribution. And in fact, the assets we're targeting, for us, have made a relatively modest contribution to EBIT and certainly, from a life-of-mine perspective, are not going to be the assets to move the dial. That's why we're selling the businesses. That's why we won't be pressed to sell something if it's not for a reasonable value. But at the same time, we're not going to argue about the last dollar because it's a strategic play, not about the simple dollars. And so for us, that's important.
We're going well on -- as René indicated, on Tarmac. The issue for us will be across other parts of the portfolio. We've got a number of offers in, some very encouraging, some not terribly good. For us, probably the likely pathway will be the listing option in platinum, but we do have cash offers on the table, so it's a matter of how those 2 will compare over the next few months. But certainly, by mid-year, Chris will be pretty clearly knowing where he's going, making good progress on that.
The same for copper and same for coal. We added 2 assets which we've been thinking about for sometime. Seamus and the team went through the whole analysis. Very happy that, that's the right thing to do with those assets in the portfolio.
In terms of water. South America, in the midst of a 5-year drought. You got shortages of water in Chile, in Brazil as well, and so all companies are going to have to manage access to water very carefully. We've already identified alternative sources. We've already got a range of things that Duncan and the team have put in place to protect that Collahuasi and Los Bronces, but it's happening across the board. We've got other additional contingencies. And there's -- are some residual risks.
I guess the message I'd say is, if you hold portfolios that have got assets in South America, as a good question to ask is what are you doing about water across the portfolio. For us, it's very important, and we're working hard to make sure that we minimize any impacts, if there are any.
Power in South Africa, again most of you know. We do have flexibility within each of our operations, but there is a limit to that flexibility. And working with the government, certainly there is a sensitivity in the government to make sure that industry is not starved of power and create more financial pressure, but it's one that we're watching very carefully and working with the government to make sure that we've got options in place and are there things we can do internally within the business with our own emergency generation to maybe people up [ph] or help the situation. And that's an ongoing conversation. But again, generally, we've traveled through the last few months pretty well, but the country is tight, and so we're watching that carefully.
And finally, right across the globe, mining license is a big issue. The sustainability conversation and the relationship you have with local governments is absolutely critical. It's strategic. And it's one that we're certainly taking a lot of interest in to make sure that we don't have major surprises in the business.
Not going to do a summary. If we just finish off with key deliverables.
Minas-Rio, we want to see it at least at 80% capacity by year-end. That will put us in a place to deliver our 26.5 million tonnes target for 2016, that's where Paulo and the team are very focused, and at the right costs. We've got the opportunity to keep working those costs now. That's what Paulo is doing. He will be, in parallel, implementing the new operating model as he commissions the site as well, so he's going to work on both sides of the equation.
Portfolio, René talked about Lafarge. The other assets are in process. We've only taken into account that -- the Lafarge Tarmac this year in terms of our numbers. We do expect the bulk of things to be finished off by the end of '16, but again, the only caveat there is we are not -- in the far South [ph], we're not pressed. We've managed the balance sheet. Every dollar we pull out of the operations are certainly having a 2 to 3x effect on the debt that we're reporting. And that's where the big focus is, but we'll work both sides of the street.
Operating model, the key is to get this out faster. The benefits that we've seen in coal, at Sishen are now being taken on and rolled out to other parts of the business. Chris, Duncan, Norman, in other parts, in Kolomela, Philippe have already picked up key elements and are cherrypicking and supporting improvements in their operations, plus, with their own teams and ideas, and they're making good progress, so it's had a much broader impact. So there are the areas that we're focusing on in the next 12 months.
And for us, as I said, in managing mining inflation in South Africa, it's not simply about mining smarter and efficiency. It's about structural change and efficiencies. And for us, productivity is a keyword in South Africa. Norman has already made announcements about what he's doing, head office overheads, his efficiencies and the improvements he's made. He's already made a 10% improvement on his unit operating cost. There's more to be had. That's where he's focused with the team.
In platinum, the restructuring of the business so that we ultimately come down to a Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Twickenham and then Unki as the core of the asset, dominating the left-hand side of the cost curve, Mogalakwena 45% margin on these prices today. It will be a very different business within 2 to 3 years. And thermal coal, the early signs in the rollout of the operating model, we've seen very good improvements in productivity. In particular, we've seen big increases in equipment performance, which is something we want to roll out more broadly in South Africa. And we'll learn from what we're doing here then take that into other parts of the business and vice versa. So big push this year in getting South African costs back in control and running certainly significantly lower than those normal inflation rates. 
With that, we're very happy to take questions."

A couple of questions, firstly going back to your comments about platinum and the listing option at the moment looking most likely. Could you maybe give a bit more context around how you see that unfolding? Do you think that there is -- it's practically possible to list 100% of that business? Or would you see Anglo American or Anglo platinum holding onto a stake in that? And then secondly, a question on working capital, I guess, for René. You obviously saw a very small build in working capital through the course of this year, which was in contrast to what we saw yesterday with Rio Tinto. You obviously have Minas-Rio, which I guess is influencing that; some stuff going on at De Beers. I was just wondering if you can maybe provide some commentary around, stripping those one-offs, if you like, or special items, what do you think that the underlying working capital performance was for the business."

On the inventory side, you had the benefit of the sell-down of platinum inventory. You remember we built the safety inventory in 2013 in the anticipation of this price. That's what allowed us to continue to supply our customers. So there was the reduction in platinum inventories, especially in the first half of the year, during the strike. Going the other way, we had the benefit from a production standpoint or the recovery at Kumba, and we replenished the level of inventory in Kumba. So flat on the inventory side. On the debtors side, it was a reduction of $400 million, both the pricing reduction, which is what you saw as, I guess, yesterday with Rio, but also there was high level debtors at Kumba at the end of 2013. And then on the creditors side, there was a negative movement of $400 million. That's due to Cerrejón but also the unraveling of some of the creditors on the CapEx side, especially with Minas-Rio, as we are paying off the suppliers."

I think the mining companies that have done well long term are those companies that have worked their resources to their potential. I think that's where the big opportunity is for Anglo American. We've got 15 to 20 resources that aren't being worked to their potential in the next 3 to 5 years. The real value proposition for this organization is getting those assets right up to their potential. That's where I think we've got more upside than most in terms of the way we're running the portfolio. That's where we're focused.

And everything we've done to date suggests we've got a much bigger resource potential. I won't put numbers to it. That would be inappropriate at this stage, but certainly, how we can work those through as being off debt [ph], I think water is the key issue. And as you know, we're doing environmental work on Los Sulfatos, which is adjacent to Los Bronces. And we're also doing the regional exploration. So both are in the early phases, and certainly we're not in a position to say it'll be this or that. By the end of this year, in our December review, we'll give you much more shape in terms of both of those in terms of direction in travel and what the key issues will be in taking those assets up to their potential. On Quellaveco specifically, I think, first, that we've got to say good progress on the feasibility work and the project development strategy. We've certainly enhanced the project in many ways. I'm very pleased with the progress that's been made. The project will go to the board in June for review. The challenges we have, as you all know, is around copper price in the market. So those issues will be taken into account. Our approach in any investment of this type would be to syndicate the project, so all of the things we've said from a strategic point of view hold. And from our point of view, I think it's important to acknowledge, unlike many projects that are being talked about, we've got tremendous support from the government at the federal level, the regional level and the local community. So we've done all the work at all the right levels to position the project. The key will be the market and how we assess things going forward in terms of what we can do.

We spend more -- twice as much as most as on training so, in the end, we can stand up in any forum and just to follow the contribution we've made to South Africa, and the Mining Charter, in my view, will confirm that we are a responsible corporate citizen. The Mining Charter holds no fears for us, in my view, but there will be the usual conversations about could we do it better? The answer is, yes, we can, not a big risk, I don't think. In terms of diamonds, we've said that the market was a little weaker. It's still too early to forecast beyond where we are today. I think we've had one site, Philippe, this year, yes, it's a bit weaker post-Christmas. We expected that. I think you've got to be in the second quarter before we get good sense of how well the market's moving forward. There were some good reports in sales. There were some weaker reports. So at the moment, it's still a little mixed. We're certainly doing better than others are reporting in terms of their value received per products. Don't forget quality.

We're certainly not suggesting a negative contribution in terms of the tax, so don't connect the 2. They are 2 separate conversations.

So we're very proud of what the De Beers team has done. And certainly, we'll be doing everything to support them as they go forward and improve the business overall. But the market, yes, a little bit weaker, but certainly from our point of view, we're hopeful in terms of looking forward. Tax, do you want to make specific comments on tax, René?"

De Beers also had a very low tax rate in 2014 because we were able, following the approval of the Gahcho Kué project, to recognize a new fair tax asset associated with some tax losses in Canada.

And from our point of view, that's been taken into account in the way we've put the numbers forward. As René said, we would syndicate. And the decision to go forward would go with the syndication decision, which would manage our capital inside the targets that we've talked to. Other projects will have to then run the gamut of the market and the discipline and the targets we've set for ourselves as a business. I still think there's improvement available in our ongoing capital spend. We've improved our capital efficiencies more than 10%. I still think there's a lot more there in certain areas. Other areas have done really well pulling their capital down. So from our point of view, I think there's a lot more we can do on capital, albeit there's been some really good guide. So if I could make the point, you're not going to see a major capital blowout in this organization. We're going to be prudent, careful, but we're also going to make sure that we're making decisions for the long-term benefit of the business. And so if it's the right decision to go forward, what we'll do is we'll think about the syndication as a way of financing it and protecting our flexibility as a business and making the right call. Can I go here, to be fair? And then I'll come -- then I'm going to pick up South Africa as well. Yes?"

We said very clearly to the government that we were looking to reduce because the domestic-supplier mines are generally smaller scale, shorter life, so from that point of view, just dialing down our position over time. The government was actually quite supportive of that conversation because they're looking for more than 51% for suppliers. So from their point of view, it aligned with what they wanted to see. So we originally started the conversation as a strategic position. If someone were to come in and offer us something to step right back, then we'd be open to that conversation, but we're certainly not out there canvassing then. We'll see what comes in. The current situation, no difference, no change to our strategy. And it's been a constructive, open conversation, and there -- we see no major barbs on that. Key issue, make sure that whoever comes in can deliver on their social and labor plan commitments; appropriate level of transformation in terms of the Mining Charter; and beyond that, it's a commercial transaction. It is a free country constitution. You do what you deem appropriately, long as you treat us with respect. That's it. In terms of the head office restructuring, I mean you got to be a bit careful. The -- their overhead -- when we look at overheads, we look at anybody that's not on a site touching the product. And we've been restructuring the overheads right across the group. I think reductions in London are over 150. We're continuing reductions, but we are moving things around. We're closing offices. For example, we've closed São Paulo. We've closed a number of offices around the globe as we've consolidated our base metals business in Brazil. Duncan's been rationalizing his copper regional structures. Seamus, I think, was about a 350 reduction, Seamus, in -- between Australia and South Africa. That's the last -- I don't know. I think this is the fifth time you've gone through this, so it's really squeezing it down. London, we are consolidating some technical functions. And Seamus, for example, is now sitting in London, hurting because of the price of properties in the country. But so we've started that and we're continuing on. And the program will continue through the year in terms of reductions. So if I looked across the broad spectrum, we're about 20% and continuing. For us, you'll see that we're down 40% on the numbers. And by the end of the year, we'll be at a $500 million run rate. And we expect to go beyond that as we look at the impact of disposals on the structures as well, which will go into 2016. So it will be continuing across the globe, okay? Can we take a call from South Africa, Paul? I'm not sure who we -- okay, good."

Gareth [ph], I'm looking at you. All right, thanks. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us here today.
If I were to talk to industry themes that we've all been hearing about the last few weeks and, in particular, probably the last few days, you will have heard commodity prices, capital discipline and returns, restructuring and costs. I'm going to say that you'll hear a bit more of that during the course of my conversation. And I would hope that those here representing shareholders will see that we remain absolutely focused on delivering total shareholder returns.
In terms of Anglo American, in the last 5 quarters, we've talked about delivering, and we have delivered on commitments. We've actually consistently increased our operations guidance, and we've consistently been cutting our capital. You will be in the same conversation, albeit coming off the December results. There's not going to be that much difference in the last 2 months in terms of what we've done, but again, we're continuing to tighten up the business. And if I could say in a very somber way, it's a tough market. In terms of the work we've done, we've positioned ourselves to continue to improve, but I would say there's still a lot more to be done. And in our view, the markets will probably remain very tough for the next 1 to 2 years. The real judge for us or the real challenge for us is to make sure that, when the market does come back our way, we've done all the right things to ensure that we pick it up and go forward in a positive and constructive way and that we don't miss the lessons that have needed to be learned coming into the situation we're in. And I think, in going through the conversations, the most important point for me to make is, as an organization and in particular with our strategy and our focal points on performance, that's something we're determined we don't miss as a leadership team. And certainly, that's a constant conversation with the board given where we've been, given where we are today and given where we're determined to go in terms of the future.
I will and we will, René and myself, be presenting. We will be relatively quick in moving through the data. We just come off a fairly long session in December, and so from our point of view, we don't see much point in going back through the ground you already know. What we want to do is trying to give you more opportunity to ask questions about what you see as being the critical issues in the business. So from that point of view, we'll move through fairly quickly, fairly briskly. If we don't pick up something during the course of the presentation, be very open to pick it up in Q&A and then follow with our roundtable so it gives you more of an opportunity to ask questions and hear our thoughts on the business from the things that you see as being important.
I will start up with conversation around the meat and potatoes part of the business. So without fanfare, we'll talk about quickly EBIT, $4.9 billion, down 25%, obviously impacted by lower prices and the platinum strike. I will talk about the impact on platinum a little bit later and, if we adjust for what that meant for the business, how we've performed against across the portfolio. In going through the clean numbers, and you will have seen those numbers, and we'll pick these points up. And René in particular will dissect those numbers in more detail, so I won't go through that any further than to say the net debt number, $12.9 billion is about $1.8 billion less than we thought it would be when we were thinking forward 12 months ago. It reflects improvement in operating performance, tight control of capital, delivery on projects ahead of schedule and under cost. And it reflects a real focus on making sure that we could control those things we can control. There is some timing issues on capital but not significant. That's been achieved despite a tough pricing environment that we've experienced right across the portfolio, but from our point of view, that's been a very important number. And as a consequence of being able to manage the balance sheet in those exposures, we've been able to maintain the dividend. And we're confident, with what we're doing and where we are even with this price environment, that we'll manage that and continue to deliver on our commitments both in terms of debt targets and dividend.
From an operations perspective across the business. Sishen delivered 15% above plan. And at the same time, you will see that our waste numbers were a bit, a little bit less than what we were targeting. But if you remember, halfway through the year, we said we've stripped 10% out of the long ""life of mine to waste"" schedule. So the waste that was moved is consistent with the new operating plan, and the business is on track to deliver its ore targets for 2015 and 2016. And we've increased our ore production guidance for 2016. So Norman and the guys have done some good work. 2015 is going to be a big year still, but good performance across those targets, with more to be done.
Minas-Rio, not much else to be said, 2 months early -- ahead of schedule, rather, 2 months early; $400 million lower than the schedule. Platinum restructure, on track, divestment process underway. I'll talk a little about that a little bit later, and René will pick up divestments.
Copper and nickel both turned around, very happy with the progress that's been made. I won't say much else about nickel later in the presentation. Just to make a comment that we've more than doubled production from where we started. We've cut 30% out of the cost. The furnace rebuild, that started on the day we said it would, and we're tracking ahead of the schedule. So very pleased there.
And De Beers, good work in the markets. The one thing that really pleases me is the operating improvements we've seen at De Beers, and I will pick that up a little bit later.
So generally, delivery on all of our major commitments, pretty happy with the progress but a lot more to be done.
Safety, key measure for us in any environment. Obviously, no one's ever going to accept 1 fatality in any business, so for us, the loss of 6 colleagues is a tragedy and is something that we deeply feel. Having said that, we're pleased with the progress reducing fatality rates by 60%. The single, most significant improvement in 1 year in the group's history, best set of safety results we've ever delivered: a 25% reduction in our total frequency rate. When you go back to the fatality number, if you remember, in 2014, we had 1 incident where we lost 6 colleagues. So if I compared safety incidents or fatal incidents to fatal incidents, our improvement is more like 40%, still solid but it's closer to that 25% to 30% improvement across the accidents. I think that's a fair reflection of the progress we've made. And so still a lot more work to be done on safety, but we're pleased with the progress so far.
On the environmental side, again, we're focused on all aspects of the business. When we present our results, we make sure we touch each of the key cornerstone positions and things we're focused on. Our events, which are spills or emissions to the environment, down to 15. Seamus and the guys have done a lot of work in the coal business, and this was about flooding events across a number of jurisdictions. So big improvements, still more to be done.
I guess, when you look at our sustainable approach in environment, community relationships and the broader stakeholder relationships, if you go to any index across the industry, we're usually 1 of the top 3, as we should be. For us, it's strategic. The world is becoming a tougher place. You have to have the right relationships. You don't want to wake up in the morning and find out that your business have been stopped because you haven't got the right relationships. Again, we remain focused. And for us, this is a key metric and one that we talk about consistently with all other parts of the business.
From an operations perspective, we've made good progress across the portfolio. Each business, compared to 2013, has improved. I do make the comment that, from a platinum point of view, obviously we've adjusted for the strike. All of those operations that continued through the strike were 3% above where they were last year. And we were able to deliver on all of our contractual commitments, so that was important. Chris and team saw the potential for a strike, and we said we were going to stand our ground and make sure that the outcome was a sustainable outcome. It certainly was tougher than we thought it would be, but we did stand our ground.
And in copper, I think Duncan is sensitive to how that appears on that overhead. You've got to remember that he's eaten a 7% reduction in head grades, so in terms of throughputs, he's up almost 10%. He's got longer leads, and he's moving more waste. And so the performance on an underlying basis has been very strong. And in fact, he's 7% above his guidance numbers as well. So we're very pleased with the progress, albeit the actual headline volumes are down. So across the board, significant improvement across the business. I think this is the first time that we've outperformed across the portfolio certainly in the last 10 years, and that's driven the outperformance on budget and guidance numbers.
In terms of unit operating costs, as people know, we're really focused on margins. And obviously, cost is something we can control aggressively.
If I start with the challenges. Inflation, South Africa, the big challenge for us as a business across the portfolio, around about 5%. In local dollar terms, our costs were 2% above where we were in 2013. In terms of real performance, we've reduced our costs by around 3% -- I don't know what I've done there. Oh, there we go.
We've reduced our costs by about 3%. The big challenge in South Africa and, for us, Kumba, coal and platinum have each got structural changes in process to turn those trends around so that we're reducing our costs in local dollar terms. And I'll talk about that when we do the quick analysis on each of the business. And in copper terms, as I said, we've had the grade, plus the increasing waste movements. On a real basis, the copper team, I think we're about 5% down, Duncan, in real terms. So some progress but more to be done.
And we don't try and take the credit of the U.S. dollars. Many will just report the U.S. dollars. We think it's appropriate to report our nominal figures so you know what we're trying to do to turn those trends around. And quite frankly, the U.S. dollar will be what it will be. Just to report the final number: We're down around 5% across the portfolio in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar.
Lots more work to be done on cost, certainly made good progress but a lot more to be done. We haven't bought these costs. That is, we haven't thrown massive amounts of capital at this performance. In some businesses, you will see significant capital and volume increase off capital. This is about improving the business and improving the controllables we have without throwing capital. So we pulled our capital back at the same time. So a lot more work to be done, good progress but more to be done.
On a broader basis, and René will pick these up, you'll see the ""business area by business area"" variations. De Beers, I'll talk about a little bit later. Both cost and operating improvements are underpinning a very good result there. The one thing I did want to say, though, in terms of our thesis for a diversified miner being the ability to manage through the cycle and through various commodity cycles, we should be, in the long term, in a more robust position. Certainly, 2014 prices bore that out. Again, if I adjust for the platinum strike, our drop in earnings of 25% would have been 14%. That puts us top in class across the majors in terms of dealing with the overall price big drop over the 12 months. We should be doing better than that, in our view, in terms of managing costs. We've made good progress, but we need to do more. But certainly, that was, I thought, a pretty important chart. And again, René will give you another spaghetti chart that pulls across all of the commodities to give you a sense of what each one's done.
In terms of the unit analysis. Kumba dominated, obviously, price, FX and inflation variations in terms of the earnings. We also increased our waste volumes. The good news is, for Norman and the team, that the unit costs that were reduced for tonne moved, which is about 10%, actually offset the increase in waste costs. So there's been a good -- there's been good work on unit costs, but there's a lot more to be done. And Norman and the team, through the course of this year, will be working overheads and their efficiencies and their unit costs in driving out the operating model across the full business. Where they have put the operating model in place, they're seeing improvements in efficiency of around 30%. They are seeing in some areas 60% improvements, but that's more about equipment and other factors that have been done. We try and separate the improvements so we understand what's working, what's not working.
From a waste movement perspective, as I said, because we've changed the actual configuration that the pit would drop waste out in the longer term, our waste movements have dropped a little. It does shorten the life by about 18 months, so it's not significant, but it does front-end load the value or certainly improves the front-end loading of the value and certainly worthwhile in terms of the business.
Big focus this year will be to continue the waste movement, make sure that we're opening up the ore to deliver the tonnes for this year; and the 38 million tonne, which is an upgrade on the 37 million tonne that we forecast this time last year.
On coal, again significant improvement in the costs, and I think we're at about 16% or 17% costs on an apples-for-apples basis. I think Grasstree is probably the #1 longwall in the country now, Seamus? We did have some challenges at Moranbah with some hydraulic ram challenges that'll take us probably till mid-year to sort through and change that?"

We've got through the worst of the longwall areas, but we will pick that back up.
Very pleased with their performance. And in particular, this has been hard-nosed focused on efficiency, reducing costs: overheads, regional, operations, the restructuring of Dawson, the restructuring of Foxleigh, the pulling of costs back in the Hunter Valley. So significant performance improvement across the board. We are now a low-quartile-cost producer in the global metallurgical coal business with one of the best metallurgical qualities in the world, so certainly improving. We've narrowed that now -- I think, we're #1 and #3 in the longwall rankings in Australia as well, so we've certainly outperformed our peers in those areas that you can compare apples with apples. And I think Seamus and the team have done some great work.
In copper. Now if you'll remember, from 2012 to 2013, we went from 660,000 tonnes after the problems in the pits with mine development. Duncan and the team have turned that back around last year, in particular with a very strong second half. We delivered 770,000 tonne. This year, I think we're at about just a tad under 750,000. We knew there was grade and waste headwinds that they were traveling into, but they've still continued to improve the operation with a 7% improvement, 7% to 10% improvement, depending on where you are, on throughputs. Remember El Soldado and the grade drops at Los Bronces had a big impact. So the underlying performance has been strong.
We've consolidated the recovery. The pits are in proper sequence, and they're set up to continue to improve performance. The one caveat or the risk, I think, that we need to flag, and we did do this in December, is Chile is still in drought. It remains a risk, and in fact, it was impacting our operating performance in November and December. And so there's a whole range of things we've put in place, and I'll pick it up as a broader risk for the business and for the industry, quite frankly, later in the presentation. So good progress, still a lot more work to be done.
And certainly, Collahuasi and Los Bronces are really key assets for us longer term, and the improvements continue.
In the platinum business, the strike dominates. I'll just deal with some good news and then come back to the strike. In terms of those assets, they've continued to operate 3% above budget, doing pretty well, Mogalakwena in particular up to 370,000 ounces. So Chris and the team were able to find some additional process capacity. The mine certainly got the capacity to do that, plus, and so I think some good work there. And as you know, Mogalakwena got a 45% cash margin. It would be 42% in this price environment but doing very well. And the progress on the pit looks good. And if you look at almost every quarter, there's been a step change in efficiency and delivery at Mogalakwena. And certainly, the guys are making every post a winner. So good performance.
The key now for us is to continue to bed the operation down, settle the relationships, drive the efficiencies and continue on with the disposal program. Clearly, that will create some tension in some of the conversations. The most important thing is we're ahead on the rationalization -- or the restructuring, I should say. We're ahead on the restructuring in terms of reducing numbers, making good progress, but we're going to have to tiptoe carefully as we manage all the key relationships over the next 12 months. But again, really pleased with the progress the guys have made and how well they've done since coming back from the strike.
On De Beers, modest price improvements during the course of the year; obviously, the market a bit softer towards the end of the year and into the new year, certainly not something that we're panicking about. It is what we'd expect to see in terms of the market. The good news for us, I guess, from an operations perspective is that improvement there, which is Jwaneng is up 10%. Costs are down 10%. Orapa's down -- or up in terms of volume, down in terms of costs. And we found a lot more resources and reserves at Orapa. So that's the really encouraging piece. So some really good work at De Beers and if you then add the benefits of integration, the reduction in overheads, certainly some improvements. And again, more to be done but encouraging progress.
Minas-Rio, 2 months early, $400 million. Today, as we stand with exchange rates and everything else moving around, we're under $50 a tonne landed in Asia. Still a lot more work to be done, but we're very pleased with the rate of progress in the commissioning. We are seeing the usual problems, ""If [indiscernible], what are we going to do with our drill and blast?"" They're the normal things you see, but the progress has been very good.
We've loaded 8 ships. I was actually in China the day before our first shipment arrived with one of our customers. The feedback we've had on the ships that we have delivered have been very good, very high quality. If we remember, it's a 67% product, low deleterious elements, so the quality has certainly been a hit. And I'm very pleased with the progress in terms of the operation.
Clearly, it's a challenging market, and the team is working on what they've got to do to make sure we remain competitive in the market. And that's both a Kumba conversation and a Minas-Rio conversation, but very pleased with the progress that Paulo and the team [indiscernible] have done some good work.
On the projects side. Grosvenor, this is Seamus' tunnel borer. I think, Seamus, last week, we holed through to the underground workings, so it's ahead of schedule. It's on budget, so very pleased with the progress. You will see, when we do -- when I talk about Driving Value, that we've now put it in as a potential contributor in 2016. It wasn't in our early numbers, but they've done a good job. I'm certainly very pleased with the progress.
We're commissioning Boa Vista. It will likely make a nominal contribution in 2016 as well. On the diamonds side, minus 55 degrees, the ice road looks like it's good. So the biggest risk to the project was getting supplies through the ice road. It looks like it's been navigated, so, so far, so good. I don't want to put the marker on you, Philippe. So I'm just saying that, at the moment, it looks pretty good.
The one disappointing area, and I won't overplay it, but what we did find is the licensing process at Cerrejón with our other 2 joint ventures through the management company was a bit tougher than anticipated, which is something we've seen right through South America. You will see that we haven't nominated a contribution on the project, per Driving Value. What we have found, though, Seamus and the team, with our colleagues in the asset, have identified operating improvements that will likely make a contribution in the operating asset improvement area, as opposed to the project area. So for me, that's still a good outcome and some lessons to be learned on the licensing, but other parts of the project have all gone to plan.
With that, I'll hand across to Mr. Médori."

Okay, good morning, everybody.
First in the highlights, the dividend. We maintain the final dividend at $0.53. We are fully committed to our dividend policy, which is to maintain or increase the dividend through the cycle.
In term of earnings, a 17% decline of earnings compared to a 25% decline in EBIT. That's due to the business mix. De Beers contributed in excess of 40% of the group earnings in 2014 compared to 20% in the prior year. You'll remember the way we account for Debswana, the joint venture in Botswana. We consolidate Debswana on an after-tax basis, so that reduced the reported tax rate. In term of tax rate for the current year, 2015, we expect tax rate between 30% and 32%.
We also reported an impairment of $3.9 billion. I flagged this potential impairment at the December Investor Day. I think it was answering a question from you, Jason, $3.9 billion, predominantly for Minas-Rio. As you know, we have completed the project ahead of the revised schedule, and we also announced that the total CapEx will be $400 million lower than the revised number, so no change from an operational standpoint. It's all driven by lower commodity prices, lower iron ore price in the short but also our expectation in the medium to long term.
Both CapEx and net debt, just slightly better than the guidance we gave you back here in December. And return on capital employed, 8%; at constant June 2013 price deck, 10%, so similar to 2013, again at constant prices.
Turning to the price variance. So for the first half, we reported a 3% decline in basket price. The price erosion accelerated in the second half, so 9% for the full year. That includes for the full year almost a $200 million mark-to-market adjustment for copper. At the end of December, we had 165,000 tonne of copper provisioning priced at $2.87, and the current price is around $2.57. There was some further price erosion since the beginning of the year. And the basket price declined 3%, again due to copper. There was also, as Mark mentioned, a further easing in diamond price in January.
Turning to the EBIT variance. So I already covered the price variance of $2.4 billion. FX, so the decline in currency in the countries in which we operate, had a positive impact of $1.3 billion, $800 million due [ph] to the round. We also got the benefit of a weaker Aussie dollar and Chilean pesos. Inflation, 5% on a weighted average for the group, again South Africa being the main contributor with a CPI in excess of 6%.
Then you see the benefit of the operational improvement that Mark has covered, both the 4% increase in production or that copper equivalent but also the 3% decline in nominal real prices. And then the platinum strike impact of $760 million, so that's impact both during the strike as well as during the ramp-up period seen in the second half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx, $6 billion CapEx in 2014. Two main projects in '14: Minas-Rio, we spent $1.9 billion; and Grosvenor in met coal Australia, $0.5 billion. You see the improvement in SIB CapEx, a 10% decline to $2 billion despite the production increase of 4% that I mentioned earlier.
2015, we have revised our guidance slightly lower, so at the bottom of the range that we gave you in December. We expect CapEx of $5.2 billion in 2015. And you remember that I flagged that we'll have more flexibility in 2016, with the level of committed CapEx below $4 billion.
Turning to the cash flow and debt level. In term of cash flow and debt for 2014, negative cash flow of $2.2 billion after the payment of the dividend of $1.1 billion.
For 2015, at spot prices, with the level of CapEx around $5.2 billion and the benefit of the disposal of Tarmac, we expect the level of debt to peak between $13.5 billion and $14 billion at the end of 2015. In 2016, again, at spot prices and with at the level of committed CapEx of below $4 billion, we expect to be cash neutral after the payment of the dividend.
We also highlighted back in December the level of liquidity of $15 billion at end of December, and we expect to maintain this level of liquidity over the next 2 years; limited refinancing both in '15 and '16, $1.7 billion in '15 and $1.6 billion in 2016.
We are progressing the restructuring of the group portfolio. You are familiar with the progress on Tarmac. We expect to close the transaction, again subject to the main merger being approved between Holcim and Lafarge. We expect to complete the transaction before June 2015. We have also added 2 assets to our disposal program in Australia: Dawson and Foxleigh.
Thank you."

Just a quick wrap, guys.
Firstly, Driving Value, progress during the course of the year. You've seen the waterfall chart. I won't dwell. Projects, what we've actually delivered during the course of 2014. You'll notice that these top line targets have actually hardened up, and we're now on track for $4 billion. If we remember, we started at $3.4 billion. We had $500 million worth of projects that we believed we could bring through. They've now been identified. Most of them have had plans actually put against them. And we've still got some cleaning up to do but pretty confident now on the $4 billion. That'll close that gap.
If we take consensus prices, that's the difference between the original starting point. But I think, beyond that conversation which you've seen, what we've done is I've just put 3 overheads here to explain the projects that underpin the business improvement numbers and give you a sense of the spot price sensitivity so that it'll help you reconcile where we're going and what we're doing. I think the most important point to make is that we're on track to deliver the restructuring targets that we set from the outset. That's the key point to make. And certainly, we think this will, might help the conversation and people understanding where we're going.
Minas-Rio, based on all the original parameters, will deliver on its targets. Boa Vista Fresh Rock will make a nominal contribution. And Barro Alto, in fact, is probably going to do a little bit better than we thought, but we still kept it at the $100 million that we nominated, which was the furnace rebuild as being better contribution. But the great thing about Barro Alto or the encouraging thing is that we're able to pull 30% out of the costs, make significant improvements even with the furnaces in the condition they're in. So that's been the positive.
So we're on track to deliver on our project targets, the $900 million that we originally set. Sorry, I should make a point that, that number there gives you a sense of the impact of prices on the project delivery component.
The asset improvements, and again I'm not going to go through these, just to let you know that, where the broad buckets were, where we're tracking, we are now, we said, net-net -- net of headwinds, we would have delivered $1.2 billion. It's now looking more like $1.6 billion, which takes some of the $500 million that we identified into hardwired projects in the improvement. Now if you go back to my business-by-business analysis, if you look at the green, which is the operating performance improvement; and the red, which is a headwind, we net those 2 together to come up with this bottom line table. So we net the 2.
So René's operating contribution, where you saw $700 million, is net of the positive operating improvements and the headwinds, for example, that copper's had to eat. That will help reconcile those numbers. And again, if there's any questions, Paul and the team will just guide you through that. So pretty clear where we see the opportunities.
In terms of those things that are now being worked through in terms of the hardwiring of timing and schedules. The column now are [ph] improvements based on what we see and the good work Norman and the team have done. Seamus and the guys, every day, is about finding another dollar. Copper, Duncan and the team working very hard on all of the pieces they're putting together, and Philippe and the team working right across the portfolio to improve margins. All very important and all pretty good. And again, sorry, I should point out the impact of the pricing assumptions, just to give you a reconciling point.
On this side, which is the Driving Value, value leakage. We've already pulled $330 million out of that part of the program. We'll certainly do better than the $300 million, but we're holding it at $300 million at the moment. On supply chain, some early gains, still some work to do to get the full 2016 target. We have set up new strategic relationships, Joy, Caterpillar, Komatsu and others, just working through the process now but certainly some good indications.
This one, we will point to if I could just make one simple observation: better than 2.7%, almost 3% above our reference price, the performance in the commercial team has been exceptional in terms of Driving Value. We've got a hardwired number we compared to and they're certainly making a very good contribution, so really pleased with the progress with Peter and the team. We remain low key because it's always that one that some people are a little bit skeptical, but against our reference prices, they've made significant improvements in ground. I spent time, Peter and myself, over in Asia talking to our customers. And the different approach we're taking with our customers has certainly been appreciated, and we're seeing it across the board. That will move around a little bit depending on the market and the circumstance and prices going down. You tend to get a little bit more of a benefit, but against our peers and our targets, we're above what our peers are talking to when they talk reference price. We're doing very well and very happy with the progress made. And the Singapore team has done very well.
On overheads, a lot more to be done. This year is a big year for us as we roll through the restructuring. Kumba, you're aware of. Norman has already started in January, 70 reductions, another 70 to come. He's done only Section 189, so he's rolling through the progress. He's got the team on site identifying the next level of change. That's going on right across the business, and it's one of those things you keep working it through to pull the numbers down, so we expect to hit the $500 million target.
So across the board, we target that $1.5 billion, which is up on what we've said before. And the pricing impact of that is negligible because it's on the cost side. So you should get full value for that work, and we're making good progress.
In terms of risks, the one thing I think we should always do is flag to you where we see the risks. These are industry risks, in many cases, and there are specific risks for us across the portfolio.
Just to let you know what we're doing. In terms of asset disposals, for us, it's strategic. The reason we're pruning back the size of the portfolio, there are a number of assets that aren't making a contribution. And in fact, the assets we're targeting, for us, have made a relatively modest contribution to EBIT and certainly, from a life-of-mine perspective, are not going to be the assets that move the dial. That's why we're selling the businesses. That's why we won't be pressed to sell something if it's not for a reasonable value. But at the same time, we're not going to argue about the last dollar because it's a strategic play, not about the simple dollars. And so for us, that's important.
We're going well on -- as René indicated, on Tarmac. The issue for us will be across other parts of the portfolio. We've got a number of offers in, some very encouraging, some not terribly good. For us, probably the likely pathway will be the listing option in platinum, but we do have cash offers on the table, so it's a matter of how those 2 will compare over the next few months. But certainly, by mid-year, Chris will be pretty clearly knowing where he's going, making good progress on that.
The same for copper and same for coal. We added 2 assets which we've been thinking about for some time. Seamus and the team went through the whole analysis. Very happy that, that's the right thing to do with those assets in the portfolio.
In terms of water. South America, in the midst of a 5-year drought. You got shortages of water in Chile, in Brazil as well, and so all companies are going to have to manage access to water very carefully. We've already identified alternative sources. We've already got a range of things that Duncan and the team have put in place to protect both Collahuasi and Los Bronces, but it's happening across the board. We've got other additional contingencies. And there's -- are some residual risks.
I guess the message I'd say is, if you hold portfolios that have got assets in South America, there's a good question to ask, is what are you doing about water across the portfolio. For us, it's very important, and we're working hard to make sure that we minimize any impacts, if there are any.
Power in South Africa, again most of you know. We do have flexibility within each of our operations, but there is a limit to that flexibility. And working with the government, certainly there is a sensitivity in the government to make sure that industry is not starved of power and create more financial pressure, but it's one that we're watching very carefully and working with the government to make sure that we've got options in place and are there things we can do internally within the business with our own emergency generation to maybe people up [ph] will help the situation. And that's an ongoing conversation. But again, generally, we've traveled through the last few months pretty well, but the country is tight, and so we're watching that carefully.
And finally, right across the globe, mining license [ph] is a big issue. The sustainability conversation and the relationship you have with local governments is absolutely critical. It's strategic. And it's one that we're certainly taking a lot of interest in to make sure that we don't have major surprises in the business.
Not going to do a summary. If we just finish off with key deliverables.
Minas-Rio, we want to see it at least at 80% capacity by year-end. That will put us in a place to deliver our 26.5 million tonnes target for 2016, that's where Paulo and the team are very focused, and at the right costs. We've got the opportunity to keep working those costs now. That's what Paulo is doing. He will be, in parallel, implementing the new operating model as he commissions the site as well, so he's going to work on both sides of the equation.
Portfolio, René talked about Lafarge. The other assets are in process. We've only taken into account that -- the Lafarge Tarmac this year in terms of our numbers. We do expect the bulk of things to be finished off by the end of '16, but again, the only caveat there is we are not in a fire sale, we're not pressed. We've managed the balance sheet. Every dollar we pull out of the operations are certainly having a 2 to 3x effect on the debt that we're reporting. And that's where the big focus is, but we'll work both sides of the street.
Operating model, the key is to get this out faster. The benefits that we've seen in coal at Sishen are now being taken on and rolled out to other parts of the business. Chris, Duncan, Norman, in other parts, in Kolomela, Philippe have already picked up key elements and are cherry-picking and supporting improvements in their operations, plus, with their team's own ideas, and they're making good progress, so it's had a much broader impact. So there are the areas that we're focusing on in the next 12 months.
And for us, as I said, in managing mining inflation in South Africa, it's not simply about mining smarter and efficiency. It's about structural change and efficiencies. And for us, productivity is a key word in South Africa. Norman has already made announcements about what he's doing, head office overheads, his efficiencies and the improvements he's made. He's already made a 10% improvement on his unit operating cost. There's more to be had. That's where he's focused with the team.
In platinum, the restructuring of the business so that we ultimately come down to a Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Twickenham and then Unki as the core of the asset, dominating the left-hand side of the cost curve, Mogalakwena 45% margin on these prices today. It will be a very different business within 2 to 3 years. And thermal coal, the early signs in the rollout of the operating model, we've seen very good improvements in productivity. In particular, we've seen big increases in equipment performance, which is something we want to roll out more broadly in South Africa. And we'll learn from what we're doing here then take that into other parts of the business and vice versa. So big push this year in getting South African costs back in control and running certainly significantly lower than those normal [ph] inflation rates. 
With that, we're very happy to take questions."

A couple of questions, firstly going back to your comments about platinum and the listing option at the moment looking most likely. Could you maybe give a bit more context around how you see that unfolding? Do you think that there is -- it's practically possible to list 100% of that business? Or would you see Anglo American or Anglo platinum holding onto a stake in that? And then secondly, a question on working capital, I guess, for René. You obviously saw a very small build in working capital through the course of this year, which was in contrast to what we saw yesterday with Rio Tinto. You obviously have Minas-Rio, which I guess is influencing that; some stuff going on at De Beers. I was just wondering if you can maybe provide some commentary around, stripping those one-offs, if you like, out or special items, what do you think that the underlying working capital performance was for the business."

So they're probably within broad 2 or 3 transaction, except it's reversed listing in an existing listing company -- listed company. On the working capital, flat year-on-year. On the inventory side, you had the benefit of the sell-down of platinum inventory. You remember we built the safety inventory in 2013 in the anticipation of the strike. That's what allowed us to continue to supply our customers. So there was the reduction in platinum inventories, especially in the first half of the year, during the strike. Going the other way, we had the benefit from a production standpoint of the recovery at Kumba, and we replenished the level of inventory in Kumba. So flat on the inventory side. On the debtors' side, it was a reduction of $400 million, both the pricing reduction, which is what you saw as, I guess, yesterday with Rio, but also there was high level of debtors at Kumba at the end of 2013. And then on the creditors' side, there was a negative movement of $400 million. That's due to Cerrejón but also the unraveling of some of the creditors on the CapEx side, especially with Minas-Rio, as we are paying off the suppliers."

We've got 15 to 20 resources that aren't being worked to their potential in the next 3 to 5 years. The real value proposition for this organization is getting those assets right up to their potential.

And everything we've done to date suggests we've got a much bigger resource potential. I won't put numbers to it. That would be inappropriate at this stage, but certainly, how we can work those through is being looked at, I think water is the key issue. And as you know, we're doing environmental work on Los Sulfatos, which is adjacent to Los Bronces. And we're also doing the regional exploration. So both are in the early phases, and certainly we're not in a position to say it'll be this or that. By the end of this year, in our December review, we'll give you much more shape in terms of both of those in terms of direction in travel and what the key issues will be in taking those assets up to their potential. On Quellaveco specifically, I think, firstly, we've got to say good progress on the feasibility work and the project development strategy. We've certainly enhanced the project in many ways. I'm very pleased with the progress that's been made. The project will go to the board in June for review. The challenges we have, as you all know, is around copper price in the market. So those issues will be taken into account. Our approach in any investment of this type would be to syndicate the project, so all of the things we've said from a strategic point of view hold. And from our point of view, I think it's important to acknowledge, unlike many projects that are being talked about, we've got tremendous support from the government at the federal level, the regional level and the local community. So we've done all the work at all the right levels to position the project. The key will be the market and how we assess things going forward in terms of what we can do.

Your ability to capture the value-in-use of this high-quality product that is being well received and the fact that you've changed the offtake agreements, et cetera, when can we hope to get some visibility on your capturing of that view? Is that something that we'll see coming through this year? Or is it really a 2016 story in terms of transparency? And then on the operating model side, the guidance you've provided in terms of operational gains, with the implementation at Los Bronces, Mogalakwena and Minas-Rio, are those benefits already in those 2016 estimates? And you talked about 30% at Kumba. Maybe some easy or low-hanging fruit there than, let's say, at Minas-Rio where you're starting from scratch. So can you talk a little bit about the magnitude of potential savings from these changes at the other 3 operations?"

We haven't baked-in additional improvements from the operating implementations other than Duncan and the team in copper have already taken into account improvements they will deliver, and that's in my $1.6 billion. There are potentially more benefits to be had, which was in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion that Tony O'Neill flagged in December. So our intention is to then update beyond 2016 in December this year, picking up what we see in the implementation. We'll be pretty well through the operating model implementations. We'll update you on what additional benefits we see going into 2017, plus we will put more shape around Tony's improvement targets that he's working because these are the guys who actually do the work. It's easy for me to talk about it. And with Tony, these guys work together, and they do the implementation which will take us beyond 2016. So those that have been planned in, in the $1.6 billion; the additional benefits that we think are there, we'll talk about in December, and that will look beyond 2017, and that's in Tony's $1.5 billion to $2 billion. I think the big challenge for us as a team is try and drive them in early based on the market we're in because I think the more pressure, the tougher the cost regime, the more urgency in driving the value in terms of our teams. So that's, I think, a big opportunity for us, but we're not putting that on the table at this stage until we're more comfortable that we've got the next level of improvement consolidated and we'll take it to the next, okay?

Can you remind us what the unapproved projects are and how likely you are to approve some of those in the current sort of price environment?

We're in good shape whichever way they choose to measure the key outcomes. There will be, I think, some more punchy conversations around social labor plans, but I think that'll be an industry conversation. If you look across the industry, we're the most significant investor in corporate social development. We train. We spend more -- twice as much as most on training so, in the end, we can stand up in any forum and just to follow the contribution we've made to South Africa, and the Mining Charter, in my view, will confirm that we are a responsible corporate citizen. The Mining Charter holds no fears for us, in my view, but there will be the usual conversations about could we do it better? The answer is, yes, we can, not a big risk, I don't think. In terms of diamonds, we've said that the market was a little weaker. It's still too early to forecast beyond where we are today. I think we've had one site, Philippe, this year, yes, it's a bit weaker post-Christmas. We expected that. I think you've got to be in the second quarter before we get good sense of how well the market's moving forward. There were some good reports in sales. There were some weaker reports. So at the moment, it's still a little mixed. We're certainly doing better than others are reporting in terms of their value received per products. Don't forget quality. De Beers is the diamond market in many ways in terms of the quality and what we put out there. So a bit early to pick. We're certainly not suggesting a negative contribution in terms of the tax, so don't connect the 2. They are 2 separate conversations. And from our point of view, the De Beers team has done a very good job operationally. And we're looking for those trends to continue during the course of the next 12 to 18 months. So we're very proud of what the De Beers team has done. And certainly, we'll be doing everything to support them as they go forward and improve the business overall. But the market, yes, a little bit weaker, but certainly from our point of view, we're hopeful in terms of looking forward. Tax, do you want to make specific comments on tax, René?"

And from our point of view, that's been taken into account in the way we've put the numbers forward. As René said, we would syndicate. And the decision to go forward would go with the syndication decision, which would manage our capital inside the targets that we've talked to. Other projects will have to then run the gamut of the market and the discipline and the targets we've set for ourselves as a business. I still think there's improvement available in our ongoing capital spend. We've improved our capital efficiencies more than 10%. I still think there's a lot more there in certain areas. Other areas have done really well pulling their capital down. So from our point of view, I think there's a lot more we can do on capital, albeit there's been some really good guide. So if I could make the point, you're not going to see a major capital blowout in this organization. We're going to be prudent, careful, but we're also going to make sure that we're making decisions for the long-term benefit of the business. And so if it's the right decision to go forward, what we'll do is we'll think about the syndication as a way of financing it and protecting our flexibility as a business and making the right call. Can I go here, to be fair? And then I'll come -- then I'm going to pick up South Africa as well. Yes?"

We said very clearly to the government that we were looking to reduce -- because the domestic-supplier mines are generally smaller scale, shorter life, so from our point of view, just dialing down our position over time. The government was actually quite supportive of that conversation because they're looking for more than 51% for suppliers. So from their point of view, it aligned with what they wanted to see. So we originally started the conversation as a strategic position. If someone were to come in and offer us something to step right back, then we'd be open to that conversation, but we're certainly not out there canvassing that. We'll see what comes in. The current situation, no difference, no change to our strategy. And it's been a constructive, open conversation, and there -- we see no major barbs on that. Key issue, make sure that whoever comes in can deliver on their social labor plan commitments; appropriate level of transformation in terms of the Mining Charter; and beyond that, it's a commercial transaction. It is a free country, constitution. You do what you deem appropriately, and as long as you treat us with respect. That's it. In terms of the head office restructuring, I mean you got to be a bit careful. The -- their overhead -- when we look at overheads, we look at anybody that's not on a site touching the product. And we've been restructuring the overheads right across the group. I think reductions in London are over 150. We're continuing reductions, but we are moving things around. We're closing offices. For example, we've closed São Paulo. We've closed a number of offices around the globe as we've consolidated our base metals business in Brazil. Duncan's been rationalizing his copper regional structures. Seamus, I think, was about a 350 reduction, Seamus, in -- between Australia and South Africa. That's the last go. I think this is the fifth time you've gone through this, so it's really squeezing it down. London, we are consolidating some technical functions. And Seamus, for example, is now sitting in London, hurting because of the price of properties in the country. But so we've started that and we're continuing on. And the program will continue through the year in terms of reductions. So if I looked across the broad spectrum, we're about 20% and continuing. For us, you'll see that we're down 40% on the numbers. And by the end of the year, we'll be at a $500 million run rate. And we expect to go beyond that as we look at the impact of disposals on the structures as well, which will go into 2016. So it will be continuing across the globe, okay? Can we take a call from South Africa, Paul? I'm not sure who we -- okay, good."

Before I kick away, I just want to make sure I acknowledge Jim Rutherford, our NAD or 1 of our NAD is here with us today. Tony O'Neill, who's just been appointed to the board. So the outgoing front row for those who wondering which is Tony. Rene, the other old guy at the front, and I'm not good of founding the young looking fellow of the 3.
I have all of our executive colleagues here with us today. Also a few other members of the team here so thanks, guys, for the work you've done and in particular, thank you for making the time to come talk to us.
In November last year, as an executive team, we sat down and did really did uptake and a catch-up on the change programs we've been introducing in particular, looking at the foundation we've been setting up in terms of making Anglo American or positioning Anglo American for the future.
The 1 thing that struck us at that time was the pressure on commodity prices, and we talked to view that it was likely that commodity prices were going to be pressed further. Quite frankly, we didn't expect to see the wrath to be so dramatic but at that point in time, we agreed we needed to push the foot to the accelerator and start moving the change, given that we had established the stability or relative stability in the operations.
And so the numbers you see today reflect the work that we were getting on with post the first phase of the restructuring. And so costs out, the productivity improvements, announcements you've heard since January, where we've been cutting overheads, staffing with Kumba, platinum, other parts of the business started in November last year. We were quite in the process. We had to be, given stakeholders and the other important people that we had to connect with in those conversations. The $700 million reduction in capital, the works started or the next phase of work started as early as November last year. And together, we committed to pull another $1.6 billion or accelerate the pulling of $1.6 billion out of the cost structure.
Those changes aren't or are consistent with the driving venue program. They're not new. What we've been doing is pressing the accelerator. Certainly, the capital disposals are new or the capital reductions are new but in terms of operations, we are absolutely consistent with the overall program but given the nature of the market we've been pushing the foot to the accelerator to drive that change.
And so for us, we're in a very important juncture where we have to continue to accelerate because quite frankly, there's a good chance and in all likelihood the next 6 months is going to be even tougher. So for us, we've got to continue driving the change and driving the change quicker and that will be the main focus of the presentation that we're going through with you today.
Firstly, on the financial highlights. You've seen the numbers this morning. I don't need to go back to them with you. EBIT, CapEx, success on disposals and the fact that on the EBIT number, whilst we're down 36%, if we talk prices into account, we've be down 50%. The fact that we pulled back around the $700 million on costs and productivity improvements and certainly helped and with a little bit help on the FX side, we've been able to do a little bit better than most people thought.
As well as that with pulling back the capital and obviously, doing a little bit better on the tarmac proceed, you see our net debt of $11.9 billion. I think that's the most important number on that page, along with maintenance and the dividend. In terms of the dividend, I'll give you a little more color but very simply put, we have a dividend policy. We've exceeded our net debt and cash flow targets in the first 6 months despite $1.7 billion annualized impact on commodity prices since we spoke in February. But what we have done is we've pulled $1 billion out of our cost base, including capital to deal with that. We've still got a lot of work to do before the end of the year to make sure that we could going forward but again, we'll look at all of those things in December once we've got the market and once we see how much progress we've been able to make across the group.
In terms of the operations, what we've tried to do is present our numbers a little differently. We've had feedback with some of the Driving Value is a little more complex and hard to model. So in these numbers, I'm not including the market improvements and of 2.5% to 3% we had in realized prices against where we were a couple of years ago. They're not included in the numbers. And some of the other more difficult areas out there. Obviously, the projects aren't there yet because we're still in commissioning phase. We're just showing here is what we've actually delivered on a cumulative basis, that's part of the restructuring.
On the right-hand side, and this will be my only reference to the key elements of Driving Value because we'll try again talk to a set of numbers that are easier to model and we'll follow-up to make sure that you're able to model these numbers. On major projects, big change for this organization, all of our major projects from where we spoke 2 years ago are on track in terms of schedule or doing better than schedule. You'll see 6 months ahead in 1 case, 3 months ahead in another and below budget. Again, helping us reduce capital.
On operations, productivities are up 17%, costs are down 22% in U.S. dollar terms and we are continuing to focus on rebuilding our technical capability and the announcement yesterday of Tony going to the board was a very clear message that, 1, we've made significant progress but quite frankly, think we are only stretching the surface and that there's a continuing commitment to getting the engine room running towards its potential. And for us, we see lots of potential.
In terms of value leakage, Peter and the team continue to do great job in the marketing side. Again, doing very well on a relative pricing basis. And the heads and other associated costs are down $600 million. Again, on the team will help unpack those numbers outside the 4 -- sorry , I should say the $1.7 billion improvement is the important number that you can reconcile back to the numbers we've shown you before in terms of where we've done better in the operations.
Just to present that story a little differently. What we're showing here margins, EBITDA margins since 2012. And we show that against the price of our commodities in U.S. dollar terms down 25%. So clearly, under pressure. We have had some help from foreign exchange, but we will so made significant improvements in productivity and costs. And so we've pulled cost out of the business. We need to do a lot more because the prices continue to deteriorate. But just wanted to show you where we've come from. And at the same time, we've improved our relative production by 9% despite closing a number of operations in platinum, gold and other parts of the business. So for us, it's about production and production -- and productivity from the operations that we do have and that's a central data the longer-term restructuring of the business and for us, absolutely critical in terms of cash, cash flow, maintaining margins and making sure that in the long term, every 1 of the steps we're taking is it sustainable, it's not about simply cutting out costs because you have 2 in a short period of time. It's doing it's because you have to and making sure it's sustainable. And that's in our view the key for this organization to be successful in the long term.
In terms of where we're going to from here, we see $1.5 billion worth of opportunities that we believe we can grab and will grab in the next 18 months. And that $1.5 billion is also consistent with the run rate improvement we would expect to be at the end of 2016 on today's prices. And so for us, it's important there I should say prices first half. For us, accelerating the changes is up secluded critical Mexican months, operating cost reductions, restructuring the overheads base across the organization, continuing with a focus on productivity and getting the engine room to work. And making sure that our capital guidance is reduced first $700 million this year and at least another $300 million next year. Absolutely critical in terms of the change programs.
In terms of that work, it's both putting back or eliminating projects that we don't see adding value and it's about improving the efficiency of mine development consistent with the efficiency changes we've seen on the operating side. So we're getting 2 hits at each of those cost items.
Beyond 2016, I'll talk about the restructuring the overheads in another $200 million that beyond 2016. We will talk about our progress on assets. We had 68 assets when I first stood up and then December 2013. we are down to 55 today from our point of view, we see that going to less than 40. We see where we'll see at the same time more than a 30% reduction in labor in terms of numbers and production will be relatively, in fact, marginally above where we are today, which indicates an underlying productivity improvement of 50%. And that's why we'll improve our relative position of the cost curves and again, I'll show that a little bit later.
In terms of what that means in using when I using H1 prices, on a like-for-like basis, we go from a 25% margin to 35%, a 40% improvement on a like-for-like basis. At the end of the day, none of us can forecast what prices will be or we could do is keep taking costs out, become more efficient and position ourselves to be competitive and we'll show you what those competitive positions look like a little bit later in the presentation.
Now in terms of the restructuring the business, I have to make a couple of I think very important points. No as an engineer, we started here 162,000 employees. If you remember the first presentation I made a very simple observation. We had only had to our budget once in 10 years. We were constantly missing our production targets, our cost targets, and we had major issues on projects. So we focused on where 90% of the costs were, the engine room in terms of the operations or are there for set a different way and we show a little differently here, in 151 where we are today, 90% of our costs relate to people who touch product from exploration through marketing, we see those functions as in line and the approach to driving efficiencies in the in-line functions requires a very different approach to the way you drive efficiencies in what we call the indirect cost structures or those 13,000 that don't touch product.
We also look at our other hits and directs London, in Jo'burg and in all the regional offices and on the mine sights. If you don't touch product, you're an overhead. What we have to do is clean-up those structures right to the organization and eliminate duplication. So it's not 500 here, a bit here and a bit there. We've taken a holistic approach to the way we run the business and the way we've got the business structured. Clearly, as we reduced the assets, we make a big change and we can change those structures. So what we've identified from today, 151,000 employees, 13,000 in those indirect functions, that's right through to and including the mine sights. In the next couple of years, we'll drop by 3,000. And in the following year, another 1,000 and that is simply a function of the efficiencies and the elimination of duplication we see across the group.
That's the focus of the work today and over the next 6 months as we as a team readies the organization. The indirect, the dropout of the system as a function of the sale of assets is another 2,000. Now there's 1,000 here that represent regional and corporate overheads that have worked that has some association with the assets that are being disposed of but we have to restructure and make decisions and we don't have to wait for the asset to be disposed of to get up those improvements. Some will go with the assets, some well where we can move earlier. So we've shown efficiency improvements we see by getting rid of duplication and other functions that aren't under value that we see is important and then we get down to 7,000 as a function of the disposals. And that's how we get to 98,000 post the disposal in the restructuring of the whole overhead structure within the business.
And that's part of the key to improving our underlying productivity is across the business, going into 2017 and the new structure, and that's a big part of the change in that you've seen in this organization. We very deliberately started with the engine room. In my experience and every major change, very difficult to take the engine room and also take overheads at the same time because in fact, you create other confusion here, which manifests in massive confusion here. So we started here. We took 15% out in that first 16 months or 1st 6 months or other and now we're going to the second phase, which has been accelerated and is certainly necessarily due to market conditions but it's also in terms of the change in the change approach that we've adopted. So with that, I'll hand across to René and then I'll pick up the operations was René's given taken you through the financials."

You see the lower effective tax rate of 28% compared to 31.5% in 2014. That reflects the commodity mix with a much stronger relative contribution from the De Beers, which has an effective tax rate in the low 20s and lower relative contribution from copper or effective tax rate in Chile is 36%.
And underlying earnings, $0.9 billion, again, reflects the lower effective tax rate but also the lower minorities us attribution from copper but also Kumba, which have significant minorities declined. Earnings per share of $0.70, that includes $0.07 associated with one-off contribution in platinum due to the physical the impact of the EBIT level was 2.2 South African rand billion. CapEx weight down to $2.1 billion as we are completing a number of major projects, especially ministry oh, but also the benefit of so focus on SIB CapEx, I will go in more detail through what we are doing SIB CapEx in my presentation.
Net debt, $13.5 billion at June. Again, as Mark mentioned, that before reflecting the benefit of the disposal of plus 50% stake in the joint venture with, $1.6 billion pro forma. This is $11.9 billion. Return on capital employed, 8%. If you go back to our Driving Value program, so look at the return on capital employed at constant [indiscernible] and excluding the benefit of impairment, the return on capital employed for the first half would have been 12%. So reflecting what we're doing in term of controllable and again, excluding the assets that we are planning to dispose, 13.5% for the first 6 months.
So turning to the EBIT reconciliation on the next page. Mark mentioned the $1.9 billion for price variance. That includes $0.5 billion for copper, $133 billion due to the market -- mark-to-market adjustment in the first half and end of June, we had 74,000 tonnes of copper provisioning priced at $2.61. We got the benefit the weaker currencies, most specifically the rand and Australian dollar. The weaker rand contributed $400 million and the Aussie dollar, $200 million.
Inflation, the weighted group average was just above 3%, 3.3%.
With the benefit of sales productivity and cash improvement, $700 million but includes a gain as a one-off of SAR 2.2 billion. Negative value of $300 million dollars. We reduced our level of sales to 13.3 million carats, a decline of 27% compared to the first half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx. $2 billion in the first half of 2015. We have reduced our guidance both for this year, $4.5 billion and for 2016. So that's already shows a $1 billion over the 2015, 2016 per year. $400 million of the $1 billion reduction comes from SIB CapEx. SIB CapEx and stripping will be down this year to $2.3 billion, and you see the improvement compared to '14, $2.8 billion -- $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion and if you go back to 2012, $3.2 billion. So that's -- the benefit of the focus on saying business CapEx both in terms of efficiency but also in term of procurement.
Turning to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. In the first half of this year, we were cash positive at before the payment of the final dividend in April of $700 million. And again, on a pro forma basis, net debt of $11.9 billion.
Despite the decline in commodity prices since we made back in February, we of reduced our guidance in term of net debt for the end of this year. Our previous guidance was for net debt between $13.5 billion and $14 billion. We are now projecting net debt at the end of this year between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. So significant progress in term of cost savings, CapEx reduction, cash flow generation, which allow us to improve our projection in term of net debt number for the end of this year.
We have maintained a very healthy liquidity. We have raised $2.2 billion in the first half of this year. So $15 billion of liquidity at end of June, again, with the cash received a week ago. So it's $16.6 billion liquidity at -- as of July. No further bond maturities for the rest of this year. $1.6 billion of maturity and '16, $0.5 billion in April  and $1.1 billion at the end of 2016.
In term of impairment, Mark will give an update of where we are with ministry oh, as you remember, we commissioned the project that the end of 2014. We are on track in term of ramp-up. So the impairment is all driven by the sharp decline in iron ore prices, earlier this year but also the review of our projection in term of midterm and long-term iron ore prices. Thank you."

I think given arsenals performance on the road when we first couple of months I think it's got a view that Arsenal made Chelsea for the championship this year in my view, this is something you need [indiscernible].
It is going to be a tough 6 months. Commodity prices certainly have deteriorated since the first half, so we're going to do have to continue to accelerate and work a lot harder to low cost of the business.
Starting with safety and the operations review. We have had a disappointing first half given the big improvements we've made in that first 18 months. We are focusing on controls around our more critical risk areas and so this a lot of work being done there. Quite normal do the same sort of thoughts sponsoring these types of pages the important thing now is now we come to that and I've down and that's where the focus is across the operations.
Consistent with the focus on safety and all parts of the business that you have to manage, in terms of environment and social development, again, I think the improvement in or the reduction in spills and environmental incidents reflects a much more important than broader issue across the business, and that is that we're working on all parts of the business in terms of improvement. And whilst in of itself it's only 1 part of the business, think it goes with safety environmental control, cost management, productivity, marketing getting better prices for our product. We have the touch every part of the business with this is going to be the leading money company and that's what we committed to achieve. And in our case, where things are becoming much be difficult and challenging from a social development perspective, our ability to engage stakeholders first us with looking after people, making sure that we are looking after their community and the environment and engaging in that constructive way in terms of all of our relationships and it remains critical and it is a strategic for us as a leadership team and as a business.
On the operating side, in terms of production, you'll see clearly that platinum benefiting from a relatively quieter industrial environment. Iron ore, making progress, a little bit disappointed in the last couple of months on the with and have been will come back we strongly. In those areas where we have introduced the operated model, we're up about 26% on efficiencies. So very pleased with that progress. We have to get that right across the site and we certainly are picking up a number of elements across the whole business.
On coal, export coal thermal, good progress on productivity improvements and I'll show that out of it later to have done very well. De Beers, quite deliberate in pulling back some volume from the market. So again, consequence of deliberate action. Coal, don't forget we closed P.R.C. at the end of last year and Sheamus and the guys have been quite selective in where they working to make sure that we continued the improvements and coal in agenda other but that is some challenges on the hydraulics at Kumba, which will be rectified as we do change overcome in August. Copper, very much a water story. The operations have been improving consistently but they are constrained at the moment with water. And that risk stays in the second half. On nickel, very deliberate, first furnace rebuild, the good news is on time a little bit early, lower cost, the good news is we've taken the learnings from the first furnace rebuild into the second furnace rebuild and we're running 20 days ahead of schedule on this and rebuild so I said to you about 8 months ago that we expect to be at full rate in our nickel business by the middle of next year. You can probably bring that back at least 3 months, possibly 6 months, so Duncan and his team has done a fantastic job in the nickel business and relative to what's happening across the industry, very pleased with the progress we're making there. Unfortunately, the costs are not doing what would like them to do but we certainly improving it cost position.
On unit costs, across the business, I think the 2 areas that we're working hard on Kumba is a waste story and with the changes to configuration and if you remember, number the team with Tony looked at the design and we turned the design configuration around what that's allowed us to do now is to be much more flexible and moving to a different that configuration for different cross scenarios and that works very good, very pleased with the progress there. This very much about our part of the story in terms of how Kumba is going to deal with the current challenging pricing environment.
And on the copper, again, very much constrained in what they've done. They have continued to strip costs out but certainly, from a production point of view, that water issue is -- has had a really impact. I should say and production and costs, Duncan and the team have actually delivered on them targets for the first half. So these work especially 1% ahead of his targets. So not a surprise and certainly expected but the comparison against last year, obviously, little disappointing.
In terms of operating costs across the business, we always look at local currencies in terms of what the guys are doing on-site. So our average inflation was around 5%. So I thought as an improvement in nominal terms has been good work. And foreign exchange has helped us to report a 14% reduction in U.S. dollar terms and we have to keep the work going and continue the acceleration.
At Kumba, very much a price and waste story but the operating improvements continue to come through, albeit with a couple of disappointments. We'll move beyond that, keep driving the overall program forward. We certainly see -- would see some good progress on the cusp and then if I go to the next page, it tells the story better than I probably can. In 2014, we were delivering ore into China at $72. Yes, we've had some help from the freight and other uncontrolled elements. The things Mormons working on are improved is to $56. The second half, we expect to be around $52 commotion which we substantially enormous and the team cents. And they have their focus and that -- I should explain and I should explain that time there. The $8 and 40 attorneys the premium over the benchmark prices that you would normally see it's 62%[ph] that reflects both quality and lump premium. If you use $7 as an average, what that says is at $52, we're breakeven at $45 a tonne. In my view, and I think Norman and I share this view and we share this view, we need to do a lot more to make sure that we are competitive by still have a view and I said about 6 months ago that Norman has to get a 4 in front of his costs. I think to be in the right ballpark and I wouldn't argue with the premise that $40 as a breakeven cost is probably cost but you need to get to to be in the right ballpark. I think it's got a lot tougher and probably we'll get tougher. That's not a commitment is yet. That's what Norman and the team are working on and will update you in December in terms of this progress in making sure we get those sort of numbers and what we look like for next year.
At Minas-Rio, solid progress in the first 4 months, couple of issues on the focus because as we opened the picked up, then we have variability of the order we get the Fedora types going through the system. Certain orders with a little bit higher alumina, but down the thickness you've got to work out the Mineralogy and the reality and that chemical requirements in making sure the filters work optimally. We've solved the problem for the first pass through the pit so we've seen a significant pickup in volumes in June, in particular, or late may, early June. And so we still believe we could hit them and 11 million to 14 million tonne -- in the 11 million tonne for the 14 million tonne range for the year.
The good news is for us is that we haven't seen anything that would were yes, in terms of the original price or cost forecast for the operation. What we have done is reflected foreign exchange movements that upon our way. Paulo and the team are working on additional cost reductions but given where it only halfway through the commissioning process, I think we'd be fooling ourselves and misleading you to say that we're on top of those in terms of the final outcome. We have to finish or get I think about it a percent of the way through the commissioning process to be confident that we can do more on the cost front. But so far, we've not seen anything that were resized in terms of hitting us on those cost targets, hence, the confidence in that target. The key number for us is to actually hit the tonnage rate in the last quarter because what we want to do is to be better than 80% capacity, so we've got running started into 2016. I'm not particularly worried by the 1 or 2 million tonne variation. It's about solving all the technical issues that we hit the ground running going into 2016 and certainly, think we're making good progress on that front. And certainly the cost all look pretty good. And coal, James and the team continue to make a solid improvements again, losing a lot on price of our peaking at up back in terms of productivity and cost out of the business. So again, good progress, made a tough call on Peace River coal, good option for the future but certainly not something that is competitive where is competitive it used to be today. Thinking about different ways of doing it but a good option longer-term. But Costa maintained that option is about $10 million a year so we think that's a worthwhile investment again, thinking about the long-term positioning of the group. And from our point of view, we try and get that balance between the 2 and so it's a good work, continuing improvement. We expect to see the second half but very good progress there.
And I'm just showing and this in Aussie dollars. So the cost performance in currency, I think, is always the right measure of performance. We go from $95 to $75 and this is across all of our products and Australia, this is thermal and. So the dollar per tonne, I think's in met coal we're down to something like $58 to $60 in that range [indiscernible] so really significant progress but good work on the cost side.
Getting a lot tougher to squeeze extra improvements here. Sheamus and the team are the first ones to adopt from last operating model and that's what we call the months and that has been a great success and we said that we expected at least 30% of the first 12 months and Norman, think we were at 26% of those areas. So good progress and shipments has been delivering in terms of that work in helping us across over the past and the mine.
In South Africa, Sheamus took over the operations in January last year. And what we've seen is starting to see the improvements come through. Still very early days, but from that trend to that trend, we started to see the right things happen. A lot of work still to be done, but encouraging, nevertheless.
In copper, it's been a lot tougher. Water, substantially a critical issue in terms of volume. There are some issues that around the mill that I think we've now track the problem, so it looks like we've had a foundation problem under the main mills of Collahuasi, so the goodness I think we've got the problem that working on the rectification as we speak. So we think we'll got that sorted.
So on look forward basis, water is the key. And we've done a lot of work and I think we're now we've now identified and we're using 70% more water from sources we've identified compared to what we had 2 years ago but still a lot of work to be done and we're still in the middle of a pretty significant drought 
In nickel, again, under Duncan and the team, we've taken our costs from $620. If you remember in mid-2013, we didn't are made a very significant change the way we were running the furnaces. And we saw over short period of time a 20% increase in the operating volumes. that's Continued. we've finished the first rebuild, learned a lot of lessons. We're now, i Think, 15 to 20 days ahead of schedule. Costs Are coming down. So we believe that full capacity now we're looking at around $4 a pound, again, the call of our operation, we continue to hunt for opportunities but that's been the significant improvements in terms of where we are. And we said the base was around $5.50, that's significant improvement in terms of that. And certainly, the progress on the furnace has been a good story.
In platinum, as you know, Chris and the guys have been very busy at about 57 different fronts. The good news is the recovery post strike, still more to be settled but we better. We did get a one-off adjustment. Certainly from our point of view, a good outcome, always better to get a positive stop adjustment then a negative so it tells us that the balances are probably leaning on the right side. But lots of work to be done and in what is typically a tough market, the good news for us in particular is the long-term asset. Mogalakwena, 2012, these are the cash operating margins that you've seen so against the price profile, that's what's happening with our margins. So significant improvement in the operations, the efficiencies of the operating level manifesting in the material improvements in our margins and so I think Chris and the team have done a great job there. And if you remember, we were at about 300,000 to 320,000 ounces. For 6 months, 400,000 ounces a record for the operation. Virtually no capital. We have had the help from the boiler plant that virtually no capital. We are doing most of this work in fact, all of this work production at the moment is been focused on intellectual capital, not cash and I think that's the important thing and we still see more opportunities across the business. In Rustenburg, lots of work. When you go from 24,000 to 16,500, after all the noise, it's been done. And the success in terms of the program going from a SAR 597 million cash drain in 2012, Chris and the team have turned those operations cash positive. And that change there, I think, plus that guys, sorry about that, has been significant and probably underappreciated in terms of that so income against that price line I think that performance has been very credible and certainly from our point of view, Rustenburg has proven to be an asset that has some value. And certainly I think Chris and the guys have  done a good job and Chris would be the first to say that he's nowhere near where we could be in terms of operations across the board.
So still a lot more work and each day they're making improvements.
At De Beers, it's been a tough couple of months. The market is certainly tightening up. What we have experienced is a flattening of demand where we're seeing very strong demand in the last 2 or 3 years. We have seen a flattening of demand. As a consequence, we've pulled our guidance back down to 29 million to 31 million carats and if you think about the market and volumes and sales go, we generally sell 55%, 45% in terms of distribution of sales during the course of the year. This year, it's more likely to be more like 50-50. And so with that in mind, we've pulled our volumes back and I'll you work out what you think the sales might be as a consequence but we are working with our customers and all the place in the chain to see if we can manage the volume that's sitting in the midstream and from our point of view, I think that's a very important piece of work over the next 2 or 3 months to make sure that the market becomes stronger and that we go forward so as we go into 2016, we've got the market in the right place and heading in the right direction for all of the key stakeholders.
In that, we provided a bit of a description of what we see the market, particularly with the buildup of stock in the midstream. Again, working with our customers, working with our stakeholders to make sure that we're managing the areas that we touch consistent with taking a leadership position across those areas that we lead.
In terms of our response production, qualification a lot of work sort oldest and making sure that we're providing our customers with the flexibility they need to manage through this more difficult time.
Finally, a few slides just to wrap. Talking about Anglo American in the future. Today, we're well underway. We started with 68 assets, 55 today. Some of those assets have been close, so we're not talking about the 68 to 55. We have sold some assets, generally we've closed -- we've made tough decisions on assets. We're looking in terms of going from 55 to 40, the dominating theme will be sales through that process. So that's a 27% reduction from where we are. Labor forces, as I said, we'll get under 98,000 across the group. With the addition of the Grosvenor and making its contribution, we actually stick our nose up above where we have been. And so when you look at those numbers over the next 3 to 5 years, we're looking at a 50% improvement in productivity. That is a structural cost base shift and that's absolutely critical. And in my view, that's what has really defined or supported those larger companies being successful in the longer term. And I think that's something we won't focus on 2 years ago. I think that in of itself, the nature of the portfolio, the metals precious and diamonds versus the which I think will be tough the next 5 to 10 years with the supply situation and that's why our niche position is very strong, quality, cost competitive position, generally good cash generators even in those markets but our base pressures and diamonds makes these quite unique and certainly from our point of view, we think it positions us well off this strategy.
What that looks like from a competitive position? You'll see our businesses, diamonds, copper, nickel, straddling the midpoint of the cost curve. In fact, on an aggregated basis, we're slightly above the midpoint of the cost curve. We need to do much better, and with the changes, in particular, with the portfolio, I'm just talking of the portfolio changes now so as we focus on the quality assets, we move our positions in a relative basis by commodity and I'll make that a little bit cleaner for you, so the after picture sees us straddling the midpoint of the second quarter quartile. And that's a significant structural shift. Now, we're not assuming business improvements. We're not assuming that the operating model adds any value. Just by making a structural change, which is the strategic change that we're making in this business, we shift our relative cost position. That's critical from our point of view.
We believe we'll continue to make business improvements, and that should keep us up with, if not compete with all of our competitors, in the spaces we're in but from a structural point of view, we improve our relative position.
With that, the focus on those assets that our industry-leading assets, Q1 positions remains critical to continue to improve that performance on a relative basis. That's where we are.
What does that look like? Against the numbers that we posted in the first half, post divestments, we move that margin, EBITDA margin to 29%. And just so you understand the cost backs that we are talking about over the next 18 months, we improve like-for-like to about 35%. We will give you more shape and color of that towards the end of the year. Obviously, we'll have another 6 months under a rug in terms of the market probably get tougher but that will be under pressure but from an apples-for-apples perspective, that gives you a sense of where we're going.
Finally, in terms of the half year, production up despite mine closures. Operating unit costs, down 5% in local currencies, 14% U.S. dollars. Capital spend, driven off. The efficiencies and keeping a tight rein on the major projects as well as improving our efficiencies. On disposals, good to see the $1.6 billion hit the bank around probably a little bit more than $200 million better than most people thought. Copper in progress, platinum on a jewel track, we will continue to keep you informed when we hit significant milestones. And we'll give you another update, obviously, in December.
On delivery and in looking forward, we continue to press the foot on the accelerator in terms of driving more cost improvements in the business. In terms of EBIT improvement, we're targeting that $1.5 billion that I talked about, again, absolutely consistent with the Driving Value program just hope that, that's easy for people to pickup in their models. And that includes as part of the program a 4,000 headcount reduction over the period where we're restructuring and reducing our overhead costs.
For us, when we talk about Anglo American, we believe the portfolio is unique  and innovates itself provides shareholders with some choices relative to what we have in the business. Beyond that choice, which in and of itself is a strategic or from our point of view, the positioning of the portfolio, the restructuring of the assets and the focus on driving the best out of each of those assets, for us, provides us a significant opportunity to improve where we are and position ourselves more effectively as a stand-alone unit and relative to our competitors in the commodities in which we compete.
We have no control over the price. We have to do with what the market throws at us. What we want to make sure we do is make every post a winner in a tough environment so that we're creating a more sustainable and competitive business.
We're talking about -- we talked about Driving Value. I think maybe a better way to finish this presentation is we're driving change. This is a different Anglo American. With that, happy to take questions."

We will keep an eye out of the operations. Further each of the executives have improvement programs to continue improving the business and the question there then can you accelerate that program further? That's the conversation we're in today. As we were in November last year. So it's a constant process driving our costs, looking for every opportunity we can. Certainly, by the end of this year, we'll have done the London type corporate changes that we've been talking to and consistent with that, looking at where we reside ultimately I did say this morning and I know it did hit 1 of the headlines that we will be relocating offices. It won't be in the next few months because we've got commercial considerations but I made that change is a bit too expensive for a mining company considering this environment and it's not the right place to be and we're going to make a change. And that goes with some of the changes we're making in driving a very different culture across the organization. In terms of copper, is a good project but in today's market, very, very tough and certainly not something that we're ready to endorse today to go forward. So we have to watch the market very carefully. Duncan and the team have done great work. Tony and his team are now going through of that work with Duncan, making sure that all the loose bits and other opportunities that we can find to make it a better projects.

And they remain cash positive, obviously, it's getting tougher out there but the operations continue to improve the post and the platinum operation, Chris, I think we would benefit doing pretty well. Union still on its ramp-up plan but the Rustenburg assets have been pretty solid. Copper, we are still on the right side. It's getting tighter, obviously, but still in the right side. In coal, most of the assets are still in the rights. we've got a couple that we're doing work on. For example, Foxleigh, we're putting further costs out of the Foxleigh operation. So generally, we've still got our notes above the waterline. But if we've got assets there that look like being underwater for a period of time, then we'll make tougher calls and I think that's appropriate. At the end of the day, quite frankly, on the 55 down to 40, if 2 or 3 of those assets aren't able to be sold in the market from we will close them losing cash. We'll make the tough call because in the end, it's focusing on the assets that make the material difference of the business, is the strategy we're putting in place and people will still buy an asset that's on option open. And the second part of the conversation in diamonds, clearly, the second half is going to be a tougher period from what we can see.

And to get those operations on an even curve I think we've done that pretty well pretty consistent. The $1.7 billion that's being delivered actually includes the productivity benefits and a much higher revenue base. So we talk EBIT terms, been a much higher revenue base as well. Don't forget with a much lower revenue base today so the productivity benefits don't give you the same, so we believe we can deliver the $1.5 billion. We clearly want to try and do better with that but we want to do it in a way that's sustainable it doesn't blow sense the bank and we're also making thoughts on our capital on the same business so from a cash benefit that is much more significant the $700 million this year is a better efficiency improvement as well. So that's what we see and that's what we're working on today. And that's what we see going forward and we will continue to be on through 2016 but it's a real root and branch approach if you saw from the overhead restructuring as well. So that's where we are."

Their overhead structure today is a little bit less than $2 a tonne compared to 3 of their our major competitor or over $3.50 per tonne move in their overhead structure. Yes, we had a lot of stuff to take out we're attacking those costs. At Kumba, we move us out of there, 20% to 30% cheaper than our competitors in the cobra. We've got more opportunities to improve our cost but when you look at the engine room and analyze the numbers, some of those numbers that or has the perception of, so what I got to do is deal with the facts and work the numbers on the ground that we can see and we know we've got a lot more work to do on the productivity side and combined that's where we think big opportunity because we should be doing even better than 20% to 30% per tonne moved, so we do take that part. I'll make another statistic we've now got the highest productivity operations in the shadow by some 30% against our nearest competitor. So we've moved hard in changing the nature of the business. From a competitive position in platinum, we're doing pretty well against our competitors are not conference on basis. So in nickel, we've gone from 620 to $4 so each commodity pardon record against our peers, we started to stand up reasonably but there's a lot more to be done we've got to get a lot tougher and we've got to work the next level of change a lot tougher and the overhead I think it's a really important message in terms of cultural changes I do take your point but I also want to stand up and say that the metrics up side-by-side.

So yes, I think it important thing that would've to make a big story of so we all knew about the restructuring reductions that we made in 2013. When we took between right about 300,000 ounces of the market. 1 of the things that we do to make much mention was the reduction of 60,000 ounces  last year at the Union Mine and about another 30,000 ounces at Dishaba. So areas that were loss-making, so if just take small step back. Remember Union, we had 260,000 ounces. We reduced that in the restructuring to runabout 220,000 ounces. And then we had the 2 vertical shafts and the decline section. What we're able to do and the decline section and so is going to be a replacement as we both have preserved of the 2 vertical shafts. Last year, when those decline sessions were loss-making, we shut down 60,000 ounces at Union. We also had some loss-making ounces at Dishaba and although we're building up the production over a couple of years in a much more profitable areas at Dishaba, we shut down probably about 30,000 ounces. So we had 1,000 people that we had to redeploy across the group and reduce at the end of last year so we did that. So what I'm describing is actually without a lot of fanfare. We have been reducing ounces. And that's why if you see the units or the average guidance that we get to the market of between 2.3 million ounces and 2.4 million ounces, you actually see that we are increasing ounces at areas like Mogalakwena but overall, they ounces were putting not increasing. That means that we are having to reduce ounces in other areas. So essentially I think that the right way to go about reducing volume to the market and then shutdown loss-making areas across the group and I think you're starting to see that coming from London today with the announcements this morning and I think it's the right way. I think it's much easier to do that, that to try and shut down some of the very big minds, all those Mark said, equity to the will go that route but we are producing ounces in the constant basis out of our portfolio we've already reduced our own mine ounces from 1.9 million ounces to about 1.6 million. And even as we increase at much more profitable areas, you will see us pulling back in other areas and we will continue to do that. The platinum price, why is it so weak? I mean, clearly, the market has softened quite a bit then we have seen much more uncertainty in some of our key markets so China, Europe and then of course, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues with perhaps some increased strengthening of the dollar coming to the end of the year. So overall, not too bad but the softening of the market may downside risk even further. And I think the point Mark made is we're going to manage the business for this environment not some future price environment."

I'd like to say thank you for making the time to be with us this morning.
Before I kick away, I just wanted to make sure I acknowledged Jim Rutherford, our NEB or one of our NEBs, who's here with us today; Tony O'Neill, who's just been appointed to the board. So the old guy in the gray suit in the front row, for those wondering which is Tony; Rene, the other old guy up the front; and I'm Mark Cutifani, the young-looking fellow of the 3.
I have all of our executive colleagues here with us today, also a few other members of the team here. So thanks, guys, for the work you've done and in particular, thank you for making the time to come and talk to us.
In November last year, as an executive team, we sat down and did -- really did an uptake and a catch-up on the change programs we'd been introducing in particular, looking at the foundation we've been setting up in terms of making Anglo American -- or positioning Anglo American for the future. The one thing that struck us at that time was the pressure on commodity prices, and we took the view that it was likely that commodity prices were going to be pressed further. Quite frankly, we didn't expect to see the wrap to be so dramatic but at that point in time, we agreed we needed to push the foot to the accelerator and start moving the change, given that we had established the stability -- or relative stability in the operations.
And so the numbers you see today reflect the work that we were getting on with post the first phase of the restructuring. And so costs out, the productivity improvements, announcements you've heard since January, where we've been cutting overheads, starting with Kumba, platinum, other parts of the business started in November last year. We were quite in the process. We had to be, given stakeholders and the other important people that we had to connect with in those conversations. The $700 million reduction in capital, the work started -- or the next phase of work started as early as November last year. And together, we committed to pull another $1.6 billion -- or accelerate the pulling of $1.6 billion out of the cost structure.
Those changes aren't -- or are consistent with the driving venue program. They're not new. What we've been doing is pressing the accelerator. Certainly, the capital disposals are new -- or the capital reductions are new. But in terms of operations, we were absolutely consistent with the overall program. But given the nature of the market, we've been pushing the foot to the accelerator to drive that change.
And so for us, we're in a very important juncture where we have to continue to accelerate because quite frankly, there's a good chance -- and in all likelihood the next 6 months is going to be even tougher. So for us, we've got to continue driving the change and driving that change quicker, and that will be the main focus of the presentation that we're going through with you today.
Firstly, on the financial highlights. You've seen the numbers this morning. I don't need to go back through them with you. EBIT, CapEx, success on disposals and the fact that on the EBIT number, whilst we're down 36%, if we took prices into account, we'd be down 50%. The fact that we've pulled back around $700 million on costs and productivity improvements have certainly helped. And with a little bit help on the FX side, we've been able to do a little bit better than most people thought. As well as that, with pulling back the capital and obviously, doing a little bit better on the tarmac proceeds, you see our net debt of $11.9 billion, I think is the most important number on that page, along with maintenance of the dividend. 
In terms of the dividend, René will give you a little bit more color. But very simply put, we have a dividend policy. We've exceeded our net debt and cash flow targets in the first 6 months despite $1.7 billion annualized impact on commodity prices since we spoke in February. But what we have done is we've pulled $1 billion out of our cost base, including capital to deal with that. We've still got a lot of work to do before the end of the year to make sure that we can keep going forward. But again, we look at all of those things in December once we've got the market and once we see how much progress we've been able to make across the group.
In terms of the operations, what we've tried to do is present our numbers a little differently. We've had feedback that some of the Driving Value is a little more complex and hard to model. So in these numbers, I'm not including the market improvements and the 2.5% to 3% improvement we have on realized prices against where we were a couple of years ago. They're not included in the numbers and some of the other more difficult areas out there. Obviously, the projects aren't there yet because we're still in commissioning phase. We'll be just showing you here is what we've actually delivered on a cumulative basis. That's part of the restructuring.
On the right-hand side, and this will be my only reference to the key elements of Driving Value, because we'll try and again talk to a set of numbers that are easier to model and we'll follow up to make sure that you're able to model these numbers. 
On major projects, big change for this organization, all of our major projects from where we spoke 2 years ago are on track in terms of schedule or doing better than schedule. And you'll see 6 months ahead in 1 case, 3 months ahead in another, and below budget. Again, helping us reduce capital.
On operations, productivities are up 17%, costs are down 22% in U.S. dollar terms and we are continuing to focus on rebuilding our technical capability. And the announcement yesterday of Tony going to the board was a very clear message that, one, we've made significant progress. But quite frankly, I think we're only scratching the surface and that there's a continuing commitment to getting the engine room running towards its potential. And for us, we see lots of potential.
In terms of value leakage, Peter and the team continue to do a great job in the marketing side, again, doing very well on a relative pricing basis. And overheads and other associated costs are down $600 million. And again, Paul and the team will help unpack those numbers outside the 4 -- sorry , I should say the $1.7 billion improvement is the important number that you can reconcile back to the numbers we've shown you before in terms of where we've done better in the operations.
Just to present that story a little differently. What we're showing here is margins -- EBITDA margins since 2012. And we show that against the price of our commodities in U.S. dollar terms, down 25%, so clearly under pressure. We have had some help from foreign exchange, but we've also made significant improvements in productivity and costs. And so we've pulled cost out of the business. We need to do a lot more because the prices continue to deteriorate. But just wanted to show you where we've come from. And at the same time, we've improved our relative production by 9% despite closing a number of operations in platinum, coal and in other parts of the business. So for us, it's about production and productivity from the operations that we do have, and that's a central paint [ph] for the longer-term restructuring of the business and for us, absolutely critical in terms of cash, cash flow, maintaining margins and making sure that in the long term, every one of the steps we're taking is sustainable. It's not about simply cutting out costs because you have to in a short period of time. It's doing it because you have to and making sure it's sustainable. And that's, in our view, the key for this organization to be successful in the long term.
In terms of where we're going to from here, we see $1.5 billion worth of opportunities that we believe we can grab and will grab in the next 18 months. And that $1.5 billion is also consistent with the run rate improvement we would expect to be at, at the end of 2016 on today's prices. And so for us, it's important -- or I should say prices first half. For us, accelerating the change is absolutely critical. So in the next 18 months, operating cost reductions; restructuring the overhead base across the organization; continuing with the focus on productivity and getting the engine room to work; and making sure that our capital guidance is reduced, first $700 million this year and at least another $300 million next year, absolutely critical in terms of the change programs.
In terms of that work, it's both putting back or eliminating projects that we don't see adding value and it's about improving the efficiency of mine development consistent with the efficiency changes we've seen on the operating side. So we're getting 2 hits at each of those cost items.
Beyond 2016, I'll talk about the restructuring of the overheads in the indirects. There's another $200 million that will come beyond 2016. We will talk about our progress on assets. We had 68 assets when I first stood up in December 2013. We're down to 55 today. From our point of view, we see that going to less than 40. We see -- or we'll see at the same time more than a 30% reduction in labor in terms of numbers. And production will be relatively fact -- in fact, is calculated to be marginally above where we are today, which indicates an underlying productivity improvement of 50%. And that's why we'll improve our relative position on the cost curves. And again, I'll show that a little bit later.
In terms of what that means in using -- when I use half 1 -- H1 prices, on a like-for-like basis, we go from a 25% margin to 35%, a 40% improvement on a like-for-like basis. At the end of the day, none of us can forecast what prices will be. All we can do is keep taking costs out, become more efficient and position ourselves to be competitive. And we'll show you what those competitive positions look like a little bit later in the presentation.
Now in terms of restructuring the business, I have to make a couple of, I think, very important points. Now as an engineer, we started here 162,000 employees. If you remember the first presentation, I made a very simple observation: We had only hit our budget once in 10 years. We were constantly missing our production targets, our cost targets. And we had major issues on projects. So we focused on where 90% of the costs were: the engine room in terms of the operations. Or if I say it a different way and we show it a little differently here, and the 151,000 is where we are today, 90% of our costs relate to people who touch product. From exploration through to marketing, we see those functions as in the line, and the approach to driving efficiencies in the in-line functions requires a very different approach to the way you drive efficiencies in what we call the indirect cost structures or those 13,000 that don't touch product.
We also look at our overheads and indirects in London, in Jo'burg and in all of our regional offices and on the mine sites. If you don't touch product, you're an overhead. What we have to do is clean up those structures right through the organization and eliminate duplication. So it's not 500 here, a bit here and a bit there. We've taken a holistic approach to the way we run the business and the way we've got the business structured. Clearly, as we reduce the assets, we make a big change and we can change those structures. So what we've identified from today, 151,000 employees, 13,000 in those indirect functions, that's right through to and including the mine sites, in the next couple of years will drop by 3,000. And in the following year, another 1,000 and that is simply a function of the efficiencies and the elimination of duplication we see across the group.
That's the focus of the work today and over the next 6 months as we, as a team, readies our new organization. The indirect, the dropout of the system as a function of the sale of assets is another 2,000. Now there's 1,000 here that represent regional and corporate overheads that have worked -- that has some association with the assets that are being disposed of. But we'll have to restructure and make decisions and we don't have to wait for the asset to be disposed of to get at those improvements. Some will go with the assets, some will -- we can move earlier. So we've shown that a little bit differently. But overall, we will drive from 13,000 to 9,000 is the efficiency improvement we see by getting rid of duplication and other functions that aren't adding value that we see is important. And then we get down to 7,000 as a function of the disposals. And that's how we get to 98,000 post the disposal and the restructuring of the whole overhead structure within the business.
And that's part of the key to improving our underlying productivities across the business, going into 2017 in the new structure, and that's a big part of the change that you're seeing in this organization. We very deliberately started with the engine room. In my experience in driving major change, very difficult to take the engine room and also take overheads at the same time because in fact, you create other confusion here, which manifests in massive confusion here. So we started here. We took 15% out in that first 16 months -- or 1st 6 months rather, and now we're going into the second phase, which has been accelerated and is certainly necessarily due to market conditions. But it's also logic in terms of the change and the change approach that we've adopted. 
So with that, I'll hand across to René and then I'll pick up the operations, once René's given -- taken you through the financials."

You see the lower effective tax rate of 28% compared to 31.5% in 2014. That reflects the commodity mix with a much stronger relative contribution from De Beers, which has an effective tax rate in the low 20s and a lower relative contribution from copper, while effective tax rate in Chile is 36%. Underlying earnings, $0.9 billion, again, reflects the lower effective tax rate but also the lower minorities as a relative contribution from copper but also Kumba, which have significant minorities declined. 
Earnings per share of $0.70, that include $0.07 associated with one-off contribution in platinum due to the physical account, the impact at the EBIT level was ZAR 2.2 billion. CapEx went down to $2.1 billion as we are completing a number of major projects, especially Minas-Rio, but also the benefit of the focus on SIB CapEx. I will go in more detail to what we are doing in term of SIB CapEx later in my presentation.
Net debt, $13.5 billion at June. Again, as Mark mentioned, that before reflecting the benefit of the disposal of our 50% stake in the joint venture with Lafarge, $1.6 billion. So on a pro forma basis, $11.9 billion. 
Return on capital employed, 8%. If you go back to our Driving Value program, so look at the return on capital employed at constant June 30 prices and excluding the benefit of impairment, the return on capital employed for the first half would have been 12%. So reflecting what we are doing in term of controllable and again, excluding the assets that we are planning to dispose, 13.5% for the first 6 months.
So turning to the EBIT reconciliation on the next page. Mark mentioned the $1.9 billion of price variance. That includes $0.5 billion for copper, $133 billion due to the mark-to-market adjustment in the first half. At end of June, we had 74,000 tonnes of copper provisionally priced at $2.61. 
We got the benefit the weaker currencies, most specifically the rand and the Australian dollar. The weaker rand contributed $400 million and the Aussie dollar, $200 million. Inflation, the weighted group average was just above 3%, 3.3%.
With the benefit of sales productivity and cash improvement, $700 million but includes again the one-off in [indiscernible] of ZAR 2.2 billion. De Beers negative variance at $300 million. We reduced our level of sales to 13.3 million carats, a decline of 27% compared to the first half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx. $2 billion in the first half of 2015. We have reduced our guidance, both for this year, $4.5 billion; and for 2016. So that already shown of $1 billion over the 2015, 2016 period. $400 million of the $1 billion reduction come from SIB CapEx. SIB CapEx and stripping will be down this year to $2.3 billion, and you see the improvement compared to '14, $2.8 billion -- $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion and if you go back to 2012, $3.2 billion. So that's -- the benefit of the focus on staying business CapEx both in term of efficiency but also in term of procurement.
Turning to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. In the first half of this year, we were cash positive before the payment of the final dividend in April of $700 million. And again, on a pro forma basis, net debt of $11.9 billion.
Despite the decline in commodity prices since we made -- back in February, we have reduced our guidance in term of net debt for the end of this year. Our previous guidance was for net debt between $13.5 billion and $14 billion. We are now projecting a level of net debt at the end of this year between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. So significant progress in term of cost saving, CapEx reduction, cash flow generation, which allow us to improve our projection in term of net debt number for the end of this year.
We have maintained a very healthy liquidity. We have raised $2.2 billion in the first half of this year. So $15 billion of liquidity at end of June. Again, with the cash received a week ago, so it's $16.6 billion liquidity at of July. No further bond maturities for the rest of this year: $1.6 billion of maturity in '16, $0.5 billion in April and $1.1 billion at the end of 2016.
In term of impairment, Mark will give an update of where we are with Minas-Rio. As you remember, we've commissioned the project that end of 2014. We are on track in term of ramp-up. So the impairment is all driven by the sharp decline in iron ore prices earlier this year, but also the review of our projection in term of midterm and long-term iron ore prices. Thank you."

I think for those that are observing a bit more of a spring René's step, it's certainly not because of commodity prices. I think given Arsenals performance on the road early the first couple of months, I think he's got a view that Arsenal may Chelsea for the championship this year. In my view, there's something in his Perrier water. 
It is going to be a tough 6 months. Commodity prices certainly have deteriorated since the first half, so we're going to have to continue to accelerate and work a lot harder pull costs out of the business.
Starting with safety in the operations review. We have had a disappointing first half, given the big improvements we made in that first 18 months. We are focusing on controls around our more critical risk areas. And so there's a lot of work being done there. Quite normal to see this sort of flat spot in these types of changes. The important thing now is we come through that and drive again down. And that's where the focus is across the operations.
Consistent with the focus on safety and all parts of the business that you have to manage, in terms of environment and social development, again, I think the improvement in -- or the reduction in spills and environmental incidents reflects a much more important than broader issue across the business, and that is that we're working on all parts of the business in terms of improvement. And whilst in of itself it's only one part of the business, I think it goes with safety, environmental control, cost management, productivity, marketing getting better prices for our product. We have to touch every part of the business if this is going to be the leading mining company. And that's what we committed to achieve. 
And in our case, where things are becoming much more difficult and challenging from a social development perspective, our ability to engage stakeholders first starts with looking after people, making sure that we're looking out to their community and the environment and engaging in a constructive way in terms of all of our relationships. And it remains critical and it is strategic for us as a leadership team and as a business.
On the operating side, in terms of production, you'll see clearly that platinum benefiting from a relatively quieter industrial environment. Iron ore, making progress, a little bit disappointed in the last couple of months on the season performance but normal in the term. We've got that in hand and will come back pretty strongly. In those areas where we have introduced the operating model, we're up about 26% on efficiencies. So I'm very pleased with that progress. We have to get that right across the site and we're certainly picking up a number of elements out across the whole business.
On coal, export coal, thermal, good progress on productivity improvements. And I'll show that a little bit later. Seamus and Timber [ph] and the team have done very well. De Beers, quite deliberate in pulling back some volume from the market, so again, a consequence of deliberate action. Coal, don't forget we closed PRC at the end of last year, and Seamus and the guys have been quite selective in where they're working to make sure that we continued the improvements in coal, and I'll share that a little bit later. But also, some challenges on the hydraulics at Moranbah, which would be rectified as we do the longwall changeover come August. 
Copper, very much a water story. The operations have been improving consistently but they are constrained at the moment with water. And that risk stays with us in the second half. On nickel, very deliberate, furnace -- the first furnace rebuild, the good news is: on time, in fact a little bit early; lower cost. The good news is we've taken the learnings from the first furnace rebuild into the second furnace rebuild and we're running 20 days ahead of schedule on the second rebuild. So I said to you about 8 months ago that we expect to be at full rate in our nickel business by middle of next year. You can probably bring that back at least 3 months, possibly 6 months. So Duncan and the team has done a fantastic job in the nickel business, and relative to what's happening across the industry, very pleased with the progress we're making there. Unfortunately, the costs are not doing what we'd like them to do but we're certainly improving our cost position.
On unit costs across the business, I think the 2 areas that we're working hard on Kumba is a waste story. And with the changes to configuration -- and if you remember, Norman and the team with Tony looked at the design and we turned the design configuration around. What that's allowed us to do now is to be much more flexible and move into a different pit configuration for different price scenarios. I think that works very good, so I'm very pleased with the progress there. And that's very much about -- or part of the story in terms of how Kumba's going to deal with the current challenging price environment.
And on copper, again, very much constrained in what they've done. They have continued to strip costs out but certainly, from a production point of view, that water issue is -- has had a really impact. I should say on production and cost, Duncan and the team have actually delivered on their targets for the first half. So these were expected. He's actually 1% ahead of his targets. So not a surprise and certainly expected but the comparison against last year, obviously, a little disappointing.
In terms of operating costs across the business, we always look at local currencies in terms of what the guys are doing on-site. So on average, inflation was around 5%, so a 5% an improvement in nominal terms has been good work. And foreign exchange has helped us to report a 14% reduction in U.S. dollar terms. And we have to keep the work going and continue the acceleration.
At Kumba, very much a price and waste story but the operating improvements continue to come through, albeit with a couple of disappointments. We'll move beyond that, keep driving the overall program forward. We certainly see -- we've seen some good progress on the cost front. And if I go to the next page, it tells the story better than I probably can.  
In 2014, we were delivering ore into China at $72. Yes, we've had some help from freight and other uncontrolled elements. The things Norman's working on have improved us to $56. In the second half, we expect to be around $52, which will be substantially in Norman's and the team's hands. And they have their focus and that -- I should explain and I should explain that tag there. The $8.40 a tonne is the premium over the benchmark prices that you would normally see at 62%. That reflects both quality and lump premium. If you use $7 as an average, what that says is at $52, we're breakeven at $45 a tonne. In my view, and I think Norman and I share this view and we, as a team, share the view, we need to do a lot more to make sure that we're competitive. I still have a view and I said about 6 months ago that Norman has to get a 4 in front of his costs, I think, to be in the right ballpark. And I wouldn't argue with the premise that $40 as a breakeven cost is probably cost that you need to get to, to be in the right ballpark. I think it's got a lot tougher and probably will get tougher. That's not a commitment as yet. That's what the -- that's what Norman and the team are working on, and we'll update you in December in terms of his progress in making sure we get those sort of numbers and what we'll look like for next year.
At Minas-Rio, solid progress in the first 4 months. Couple of issues on the filters. Because as we opened the pit up and we have variability of the ore, we get different ore types going through the system. Certain ores with a little bit higher alumina bog down the thickness, so you got to work out the mineralogy and the riology [ph] and the chemical requirements in making sure the filters work optimally. We've solved the problem for the first pass through the pit so we've seen a significant pickup in volumes in June, in particular -- or late May, early June. And so we still believe we could hit them 11 million to 14 million tonne -- can't see that there, the 11 million tonne to 14 million tonne range for the tonnes for the year.
The good news is for us, is that we haven't seen anything that would worry us in terms of the original price -- or cost forecast for the operation. What we have done is reflected foreign exchange movements that have gone our way. Paulo and the team are working on additional cost reductions, but given we're only halfway through the commissioning process, I think we'd be fooling ourselves and misleading you to say that we're on top of those in terms of the final outcome. We have to finish. We'll get, I think, about 80% of the way through the commissioning process to be confident that we can do more on the cost front. But so far, we've not seen anything that worries us in terms of hitting us on those cost targets, hence, the confidence in that target. 
The key number for us is to actually hit the tonnage rate in the last quarter because what we want to do is be at better than 80% capacity so we've got running start into 2016. I'm not particularly worried by the 1 or 2 million tonne variation. It's about making sure we're solving all the technical issues so we hit the ground running going into 2016. And certainly, I think we're making good progress on that front. And certainly, the costs all look pretty good. 
In coal, Seamus and the team continue to make solid improvements, again, losing a lot on price, picking it up back in terms of productivity and costs out of the business. So again, good progress, made the tough call on Peace River Coal, good option for the future but certainly not something that is competitive -- or is competitive as it needs to be today. Thinking about different ways of doing it but a good option longer term. The cost to maintain that option is about $10 million a year so we think that's a worthwhile investment, again, thinking about the long-term positioning of the group. And from our point of view, we try and get that balance between the 2 right. So it's a good work, continuing improvement. We expect to see in the second half but very good progress there.
And I'm just showing in -- this in Aussie dollars. So the cost performance in currency, I think, is always the right measure of performance. We're going from AUS 95 to AUS 75, and this is across all of our products in Australia. This is thermal and met coal. So it's the dollar per tonne. I think in met coal, we're down to something like AUS 58 to AUS 60 in that range on the longwall, yes, on the longwall. So really significant progress but good work on the cost side.
Getting a lot tougher to squeeze extra improvements out. Sheamus and the team are the first ones to adopt a formalized operating model and that's what we call the must [ph] and that has been a great success. And we said that we'd expected at least 30% in the first 12 months. And Norman, I think we were at 26% in those areas. So good progress and Seamus has been the leader in terms of that work and helping us across other parts of the mine.
In South Africa, Seamus took over the operations in January last year. And what we've seen is -- starting to see the improvements come through. Still very early days, but from that trend to that trend, we're starting to see the right things happen. A lot of work still to be done, but encouraging, nevertheless.
In copper, been a lot tougher. Water, substantially a critical issue in terms of volume. There are some issues at Collahuasi around the mill that, I think, we've now tracked the problem. So it looks like we've had a foundation problem under the main mills at Collahuasi. So the good news, I think we've got the problem. They're working on the rectification as we speak. So we think we've got that sorted.
So on a look-forward basis, water is the key. And we've done a lot of work and I think we're now -- we've now identified and we're using 70% more water from sources we've identified compared to what we had 2 years ago. But still a lot of work to be done, and we're still in the middle of a pretty significant drought. 
In nickel, again, under Duncan and the team, we've taken out costs from $620. If you remember in mid-2013, we did a -- or made a very significant change to the way we were running the furnaces. And we saw over a short period of time, a 20% increase in the operating volumes. That's continued. We've finished the first rebuild, learned a lot of lessons. We're now, I think, 15 to 20 days ahead on schedule. Costs are coming down and so we believe, at full capacity now. We're looking at around $4 a pound. Again, like all of our operation, we're continuing to hunt for opportunities but that's been the significant improvement in terms of where we are. And if we said the base was around $5.50, that's been a significant improvement in terms of that. And certainly, the progress on the furnace has been a good story.
In platinum, as you know, Chris and the guys have been very busy on about 57 different fronts. The good news is the recovery post strike, still more to be settled but doing better. We did get a one-off adjustment. Certainly from our point of view, a good outcome. Always better to get a positive stock adjustment then a negative so it tells us that the balances are probably leaning on the right side. But lots of work to be done and in what is typically tough market. The good news for us in particular is the long-term asset. Mogalakwena 2012, these are the cash operating margins that you've seen, so against that price profile, that's what's happening with our margins. So significant improvement in the operations, the efficiencies of the operating level manifesting in the material improvements in our margins. And so I think Chris and the team have done a great job there. And if we remember, we were at about 300,000 to 320,000 ounces; first 6 months, 400,000 ounces, a record for the operation. Virtually no capital. We have had the help from the BAOBAB plant, but virtually no capital. We're doing most of this work -- in fact, all of this work that I've shown you at the moment has been focused on intellectual capital, not cash. And I think that's the important thing and we still see more opportunities across the business. In Rustenburg, lots of work. When you go from 24,000 to 16,500, after all the noise, it's been done. And the success in terms of that program going from a ZAR 597 million cash drain in 2012, Chris and the team have turned those operations cash positive. And that change there, I think -- lost that [indiscernible]. Sorry about that, has been significant and probably underappreciated in terms of the work. So again, against that price line, I think that performance has been very credible and certainly, from our point of view, Rustenburg has proven to be an asset that has some value. And certainly, I think Chris and the guys have done a good job. And Chris would be the first to say that he's nowhere near where we could be in terms of operations across the board. So still a lot more work and each day, they're making improvement.
At De Beers, it's been a tough couple of months. The market is certainly tightening up. What we have experienced is a flattening of demand where we were seeing very strong demand in the last 2 or 3 years. We have seen a flattening of demand. As a consequence, we've pulled our guidance back down to 29 million to 31 million carats. And if you think about the market and the way volumes and sales go, we generally sell 55%, 45% in terms of distribution of sales during the course of the year. This year, it's more likely to be more like 50-50. And so with that in mind, we've pulled our volumes back, and I'll let you work out what you think the sales might be as a consequence. But we are working with our customers and all the players in the chain to see if we can manage that volume that's sitting in the midstream. And from our point of view, I think that's a very important piece of work over the next 2 or 3 months, to make sure that the market becomes stronger and that we go forward. So as we go into 2016, we've got the market in the right place and heading in the right direction for all of the key stakeholders.
In that, we provided a bit of a description of what we see in the market, particularly with the buildup of stock in the midstream. Again, working with our customers, working with our stakeholders to make sure that we're managing the areas that we touch consistent with taking a leadership position across those areas that we lead. In terms of our response production. New Sightholder qualification, a lot of work with our sightholders in making sure that we're providing our customers with the flexibility they need to manage through this more difficult time.
Finally, a few slides just to wrap, talking about Anglo American in the future. Today, we're well underway. We started with 68 assets, 55 today. Some of those assets have been closed. So when I talk about the 68 to 55, we have sold some assets. Generally, we've closed. We've made tough decisions on assets. We're looking, in terms of going from 55 to 40, the dominating theme will be sales through that process. So that's a 27% reduction from where we are. Labor forces, as I said, we'll get under 98,000 across the group. With the addition of the Grosvenor and the Gahcho Kué, Minas-Rio making its contribution, we actually stick our nose up above where we have been. And so when you look at those numbers over the next 3 to 5 years, we're looking at a 50% improvement in productivity. That is a structural cost base shift and that's absolutely critical. And in my view, that's what has really defined or supported those larger companies being successful in the longer term. And I think that's something we weren't focused on 2 years ago. And I think that in of itself, the nature of the portfolio, the weighting to metals, precious and diamonds versus the bulks, which I think will be tough for the next 5 to 10 years with the supply situation. And that's why our niche positions are very strong; quality, cost competitive position, generally good cash generators even in those markets. But our base precious and diamonds mix is quite unique. And certainly from our point of view, we think it positions us well off this strategy.
What that looks like from a competitive position? You'll see our businesses, diamonds, copper, nickel, straddling the midpoint of the cost curve. In fact, on an aggregated basis, we're slightly above the midpoint of the cost curve. We need to do much better. And with the changes, in particular, with the portfolio -- I'm just talking the portfolio changes now. So as we focus on the quality assets, we move our positions in a relative basis by commodity -- and I'll make that a little bit cleaner for you. So the after picture sees us straddling the midpoint of the second quartile. And that's a significant structural shift. Now we're not assuming business improvements. We're not assuming that the operating model adds any value. Just by making a structural change, which is the strategic change that we're making in this business, we shift our relative cost position. That's critical from our point of view. We believe we'll continue to make business improvements, and that should keep us up with, if not compete with all of our competitors, in the spaces we're in. But from a structural point of view, we improve our relative position.
With that, the focus on those assets, that are industry-leading assets, Q1 positions remains critical to continue to improve that performance on a relative basis. That's where we are. What does that look like? Against the numbers that we've posted in the first half, post divestments, we move that margin, EBITDA margin to 29%. And just so you understand the cost-outs that we're talking about over the next 18 months, we improve like-for-like to about 35%. We will give you more shape and color of that towards the end of the year. Obviously, we'll have another 6 months under our belt in terms of the markets, probably going to be tougher, so that will be under pressure, but from an apples-for-apples perspective, that gives you a sense of where we're going.
Finally, in terms of the half year, production up despite mine closures. Operating unit costs, down 5% in local currencies, 14% U.S. dollars. Capital spend, driven off the efficiencies and keeping a tight rein on the major projects as well as improving our efficiencies. On disposals, good to see the $1.6 billion hit the bank around, probably a little bit more than $200 million better than most people thought. Copper, in progress; platinum on a jewel track. We will continue to keep you informed when we hit significant milestones, and we'll give you another update, obviously, in December.
On delivery and in looking forward, we continue to press the foot on the accelerator in terms of driving more cost improvements in the business. In terms of EBIT improvement, we're targeting that $1.5 billion that I talked about, again, absolutely consistent with the Driving Value program just hope that, that's easy for people to pickup in their models. And that includes, as part of the program, a 4,000 headcount reduction over the period where we're restructuring and reducing our overhead costs.
For us, when we talk about Anglo American, we believe the portfolio is unique and in and of itself, provides shareholders with some choices relative to what we have in the business. Beyond that choice, which in and of itself is a strategic core from our point of view. The positioning of the portfolio, the restructuring of the assets and the focus on driving the best out of each of those assets, for us, provides us significant opportunity to improve where we are and position ourselves more effectively as a stand-alone unit and relative to our competitors in the commodities in which we compete.
We have no control over the price. We have to do with what the market throws at us. What we want to make sure we do is make every post a winner in a tough environment so that we're creating a more sustainable and competitive business.
We're talking about -- we talked about Driving Value. I think maybe a better way to finish this presentation is we're driving change. This is a different Anglo American. With that, happy to take questions."

We will keep an eye on all of the operations. Further, each of the executives have improvement programs to continue improving the business, and the question, then, is can you accelerate that program further? That's the conversation we're in today, as we were in November last year. So it's a constant process driving our costs, looking for every opportunity we can. Certainly, by the end of this year, we'll have done the London-type corporate changes that we've been talking to. And consistent with that, looking at where we reside, ultimately, I did say this morning, and I know it did hit one of the headlines, that we will be relocating offices. It won't be in the next few months because we've got commercial considerations, but I made really simple that I think St. James [ph] is probably too expensive for a mining company, considering this environment, and it's not the right place to be and we're going to make a change. And that goes with some of the changes we're making in driving a very different culture across the organization. In terms of copper, Quellavaco is a great project. But in today's market, very, very tough and certainly not something that we're ready to endorse today to go forward. So we have to watch the market very carefully. Duncan and the team have done great work. Tony and his team are now going through all of that work with Duncan, making sure that all the loose bits and other opportunities that we can find to make it a better project occur. That's a work in progress. We'll give you an update in December.

Despite the lower volume and preparing for a few cuts, the unit cost is down 1% in local currency and 10% in dollar terms. So we are cutting costs. We are improving efficiency in all our operations. And if I can add a few words about our project. We have 2 key projects now, Gahcho Kué and Venetia underground project, not talking about Cut-8 in Jwaneng because Cut-8 in Jwaneng has been going well and is still going well. In Gahcho Kué, we are 62% complete today on time, on budget. And the Venetia underground project, we are now at 18% and remind you that we are going to start production in underground in 2021 and we are also on time and on budget. So our 2 big projects, our new projects are on time and follow the trend that Mark said that the big projects are going doing well."

So for example, with Rustenburg, we have developed a new strategy and clearly, that's been part of our whole approach and they remain cash positive. Obviously, it's getting tougher out there, but the operations continue to improve post destruct. So in the platinum operation, Chris, I think it's fair to say, those assets we've identified are doing pretty well. Union is still on its ramp-up plan, but the Rustenburg assets have been pretty solid. Copper, we're still on the right side. It's getting tighter, obviously, but still in the right side. In coal, most of the assets are still in the right side. So we've got a couple that we're doing work on. For example, Foxleigh, we're pulling further costs out of the Foxleigh operation. So generally, we've still got our nose above the waterline. But if we've got assets there that look like being underwater for a period of time, then we'll make tougher calls, and I think that's appropriate. At the end of the day, quite frankly, on the 55, down to 40, if 2 or 3 of those assets aren't able to be sold in the market we're in, we will close them if they're losing cash. We'll make the tough call because in the end, it's focusing on the assets that make the material difference to the business, is the strategy we're putting in place. And people will still buy an asset that's on care and maintenance, we'll keep the option open. On the second part of the conversation in diamonds, clearly, the second half is going to be a tougher period from what we can see. So I'm hoping that we can do better, but it would be tough to deliver the same sort of result in the second half for De Beers in that environment. Does that answer your question?"

Unfortunately, we spent some capital in areas, but we haven't got that finished yet. What we've been doing is hitting the cost at the operating level in those areas within the business. In South Africa, obviously, we've had higher inflation, but we're dealing with that and starting to turn most trends around. So we've got some different jurisdiction issues. In terms of the operations, we said the first part of the strategy was to stabilize. And to get those operations on an even curve, I think we've done that pretty well in being consistent. The $1.7 billion that's being delivered actually includes the productivity benefits at a much higher revenue base. So we talk EBIT terms, been a much higher revenue base as well. Don't forget, we've got a much lower revenue base today, so the productivity benefits don't give you the same bang for you buck. So we believe we can deliver the $1.5 billion. We clearly want to try and do better with that, but we want to do it in a way that's sustainable and doesn't blow the bank, and we're also making cuts on our capital on the same basis. So from a cash point of view, it's much more significant than -- obviously, the $700 million this year is a better efficiency improvement as well. So that's what we see and that's what we're working on today. And that's what we see going forward, and we will continue to be on 2016. But it's a real root and branch approach if you saw from the overhead restructuring as well. So that's where we are."

One point, the perception of where we sit on a relative basis, and let's say, low-hanging fruit, I think in the overhead structures, we've got a lot more work to do. And I think some important statistics might help with the debate. Kumba cut 60% out of their head office. Their overhead structure today is a little bit less than $2 per tonne compared to, 3 of their our major competitors are over $3.50 per tonne move in their overhead structure. So yes, we had a lot of stuff to take out. We're attacking those costs. At Kumba, we move a tonne of dirt, 20% to 30% cheaper than our competitors in the Pilbara. We've got more opportunities to improve our cost, but when you look at the engine room and analyze the numbers, some of those numbers aren't as bad as one thinks or has the perception of. So what I've got to do is deal with the facts and work the numbers on the ground that we can see, and we know we've got a lot more work to do on the productivity side in Kumba, and that's where we think there's a big opportunity. But we should be doing even better than 20% to 30% per tonne move. So we do take that point because labor costs a lot. I'll make another statistic. We've now got the highest productivity longwall operations in Australia by some 20% against our nearest competitor. So we've moved hard in changing the nature of the business. From a competitive position in platinum, we are doing pretty well against our competitors on a pound-for-pound basis. So in nickel, we've gone from $6.20 to $4. So when you pull each commodity apart and rank us against our peers, we're starting to stand up reasonably. But there's a lot more to be done. We've got to get a lot tougher and we've got to work the next level of change a lot tougher. And the overhead restructuring, I think, is a really important message in terms of cultural changes. So I do take your point, but I also want to stand up and say put the metrics up side-by-side. We've improved significantly, a lot more to be done, but we're not that far back compared to where were a couple of years ago. Okay. Yes? I'm doing the next, and they'll income to René."

So yes, I think an important thing is we didn't to make a big story of, so we all knew about the restructuring reductions that we made in 2013. When we took between around about 300,000 ounces out the market, one of the things that we didn't to make much mention of was the reduction of 60,000 ounces last year at the Union Mine and about another 30,000 ounces at Dishaba, so areas that were loss-making. So if just take small step back. Remember Union, we had 260,000 ounces. We reduced that in the restructuring to around about 220,000 ounces. And then we had the 2 vertical shafts and the decline section. What we were able to do, and the decline section is always going to be a replacement as we both have preserved the 2 vertical shafts. Last year, when those decline sessions were loss-making, we shut down 60,000 ounces at Union. We also had some loss-making ounces at Dishaba. And although, we're building up that production over a couple of years in much more profitable areas at Dishaba, we shut down probably about 30,000 ounces. So we had 1,000 people that we had to redeploy across the group and reduce at the end of last year, so we did that. So what I'm describing is actually without a lot of fanfare. We have been reducing ounces. And that's why if you see the units or the average guidance that we get to the market of between 2.3 million and 2.4 million ounces, you actually see that we are increasing ounces at areas like Mogalakwena. But overall, the amount of ounces we're putting into the market are not increasing. That means that we're having to reduce ounces in other areas. So that's actually, I think, the right way to go about reducing volume to the market and then just to shutdown loss-making areas across the group, and I think you're starting to see that coming from London as well today, in the announcements this morning. And I think it is the right way. I think it's much easier to do that thing, to try and shut down some of the very big mines. Although as Mark said, if we need to really go that route, but we are producing ounces in the constant basis, out of our portfolio, we've already reduced our own mine ounces from 1.9 million ounces to about 1.6 million. And even as we increase at much more profitable areas you see us pulling back in other areas, and we'll continue to do that. The platinum price, why is it so weak? I mean, clearly is, the market has softened quite a bit and we have seen much more uncertainty in some of our key markets, so China, Europe and then of course, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues with perhaps some increased strengthening of the dollar as the rate hikes come in the end of the year. So overall demand, not too bad, but the softening of the market may -- there may be some downside risk even further. And I think the point Mark made is we're going to manage the business for this environment, not some future price environment."

We'll look at whatever we can get out of it. But I think to promise anything significantly lower would not be correct. With Kumba, the plan that we put up last year is perfectly good, and we're now adjusting the plan for the lower price that every mine around the world is doing. The issue with Kumba is not the plan but the execution of the plan. And that's making sure that we have the cultural shift across the company that we get enough granular planning and that people stick to their plans. So we have -- the plan that we put up is fine. Now, we've got to make sure we stick to it and we're making adjustments with our procedures and ultimately, with some of our people to make sure that we stick to our plans and get compliance. Kumba life, in pulling the pit back, the very high cost material gets pushed to the back end. If you had to operate in a current price environment, then we need to see other changes beyond 2025, if you like, in the lab scenario. But with Kumba as it is -- essentially, its reserve runs to about 2030, so it's just really the back end."

I'd like to say thank you for making the time to be with us this morning.
Before I kick away, I just wanted to make sure I acknowledged Jim Rutherford, our NED or one of our NEDs, who's here with us today; Tony O'Neill, who's just been appointed to the board. So the old guy in the gray suit in the front row, for those wondering which is Tony; Rene, the other old guy up the front; and I'm Mark Cutifani, the young-looking fellow of the 3.
I have all of our executive colleagues here with us today, also a few other members of the team here. So thanks, guys, for the work you've done and in particular, thank you for making the time to come and talk to us.
In November last year, as an executive team, we sat down and did -- really did an uptake and a catch-up on the change programs we'd been introducing, in particular, looking at the foundation we've been setting up in terms of making Anglo American -- or positioning Anglo American for the future. The one thing that struck us at that time was the pressure on commodity prices, and we took the view that it was likely that commodity prices were going to be pressed further. Quite frankly, we didn't expect to see the route to be so dramatic but at that point in time, we agreed we needed to push the foot to the accelerator and start moving the change, given that we had established stability, or relative stability in the operations.
And so the numbers you see today reflect the work that we were getting on with post the first phase of the restructuring. And so costs out, the productivity improvements, announcements you've heard since January, where we've been cutting overheads, starting with Kumba, platinum, other parts of the business, started in November last year. We were quite in the process. We had to be, given stakeholders and the other important people that we had to connect with in those conversations. The $700 million reduction in capital, the work started -- or the next phase of work started as early as November last year. And together, we committed to pull another $1.6 billion -- or accelerate the pulling of $1.6 billion out of the cost structure.
Those changes aren't -- or are consistent with the driving of that new program. They're not new. What we've been doing is pressing the accelerator. Certainly, the capital disposals are new -- or the capital reductions are new. But in terms of operations, we were absolutely consistent with the overall program. But given the nature of the market, we've been pushing the foot to the accelerator to drive that change.
And so for us, we're in a very important juncture where we have to continue to accelerate because quite frankly, there's a good chance, and in all likelihood, the next 6 months is going to be even tougher. So for us, we've got to continue driving the change and driving that change quicker, and that will be the main focus of the presentation that we're going through with you today.
Firstly, on the financial highlights. You've seen the numbers this morning. I don't need to go back through them with you. EBIT, CapEx, success on disposals and the fact that on the EBIT number, whilst we're down 36%, if we took prices into account, we'd be down 50%. The fact that we've pulled back around $700 million on costs and productivity improvements has certainly helped. And with a little bit of help on the FX side, we've been able to do a little bit better than most people thought. As well as that, with pulling back the capital and obviously, doing a little bit better on the Tarmac proceeds, you see our net debt of $11.9 billion. I think it's the most important number on that page, along with maintenance of the dividend. 
In terms of the dividend, René will give you a little bit more color. But very simply put, we have a dividend policy. We've exceeded our net debt and cash flow targets in the first 6 months despite a $1.7 billion annualized impact on commodity prices since we spoke in February. But what we have done is we've pulled $1 billion out of our cost base, including capital, to deal with that. We've still got a lot of work to do before the end of the year to make sure that we can keep going forward. But again, we'll look at all of those things in December once we've got the market and once we see how much progress we've been able to make across the group.
In terms of the operations, what we've tried to do is present our numbers a little differently. We've had feedback that some of the Driving Value stuff is a little more complex and hard to model. So in these numbers, I'm not including the market improvements and the 2.5% to 3% improvement we have on realized prices against where we were a couple of years ago. They're not included in the numbers. And some of the other more difficult areas out there, obviously, the projects aren't there yet because we're still in commissioning phase. We'll be just showing you here is what we've actually delivered on a cumulative basis as part of the restructuring.
On the right-hand side, and this will be my only reference to the key elements of Driving Value, because we'll try and again talk to a set of numbers that are easier to model, and we'll follow up to make sure that you're able to model these numbers. 
On major projects, big change for this organization. All of our major projects from where we spoke 2 years ago are on track in terms of schedule or doing better than schedule -- and you'll see 6 months ahead in 1 case, 3 months ahead in another -- and below budget. Again, helping us reduce capital.
On operations, productivities are up 17%, costs are down 22% in U.S. dollar terms and we are continuing to focus on rebuilding our technical capability. And the announcement yesterday of Tony going to the board was a very clear message that, one, we've made significant progress, but quite frankly, I think we're only scratching the surface; and that there's a continuing commitment to getting the engine room running towards its potential. And for us, we see lots of potential.
In terms of value leakage, Peter and the team continue to do a great job in the marketing side, again, doing very well on a relative pricing basis. And overheads and other associated costs are down $600 million. And again, Paul and the team will help unpack those numbers outside the forum. Sorry, I should say the $1.7 billion improvement is the important number that you can reconcile back to the numbers we've shown you before in terms of where we've done better in the operations.
Just to present that story a little differently. What we're showing here is margins -- EBITDA margins since 2012. And we show that against the price of our commodities in U.S. dollar terms, down 25%, so clearly under pressure. We have had some help from foreign exchange, but we've also made significant improvements in productivity and costs. And so we've pulled cost out of the business. We need to do a lot more because the prices continue to deteriorate. But just wanted to show you where we've come from. And at the same time, we've improved our relative production by 9% despite closing a number of operations in platinum, coal and in other parts of the business. So for us, it's about production and productivity from the operations that we do have, and that's a central plank for the longer-term restructuring of the business and, for us, absolutely critical in terms of cash, cash flow, maintaining margins and making sure that in the long term, every one of the steps we're taking is sustainable. It's not about simply cutting out costs because you have to in a short period of time. It's doing it because you have to and making sure it's sustainable. And that's, in our view, the key for this organization to be successful in the long term.
In terms of where we're going to from here, we see $1.5 billion worth of opportunities that we believe we can grab and will grab in the next 18 months. And that $1.5 billion is also consistent with the run-rate improvement we would expect to be at, at the end of 2016 on today's prices. And so for us, it's important -- or I should say prices first half. For us, accelerating the change is absolutely critical. So in the next 18 months, operating cost reductions; restructuring the overhead base across the organization; continuing with the focus on productivity and getting the engine room to work; and making sure that our capital guidance is reduced, first $700 million this year and at least another $300 million next year, absolutely critical in terms of the change programs.
In terms of that work, it's both putting back or eliminating projects that we don't see adding value and it's about improving the efficiency of mine development consistent with the efficiency changes we've seen on the operating side. So we're getting 2 hits at each of those cost items.
Beyond 2016, I'll talk about the restructuring of the overheads and the indirects. There's another $200 million that will come beyond 2016. We will talk about our progress on assets. We had 68 assets when I first stood up in December 2013. We're down to 55 today. From our point of view, we see that going to less than 40. We see -- or will see at the same time more than a 30% reduction in labor in terms of numbers. And production will be relatively flat. In fact, it is calculated to be marginally above where we are today, which indicates an underlying productivity improvement of 50%. And that's why we'll improve our relative position on the cost curves. And again, I'll show that a little bit later.
In terms of what that means in using -- when I use half 1 -- H1 prices, on a like-for-like basis, we go from a 25% margin to a 35% or 40% improvement on a like-for-like basis. At the end of the day, none of us can forecast what prices will be. All we can do is keep taking costs out, become more efficient and position ourselves to be competitive. And we'll show you what those competitive positions look like a little bit later in the presentation.
Now in terms of restructuring the business, I have to make a couple of, I think, very important points. Now as an engineer, we started here 162,000 employees. If you remember the first presentation, I made a very simple observation: We had only hit our budget once in 10 years. We were constantly missing our production targets, our cost targets, and we had major issues on projects. So we focused on where 90% of the costs were: the engine room in terms of the operations. Or if I say it a different way and we show it a little differently here, and the 151,000 is where we are today, 90% of our costs relate to people who touch product. From exploration through to marketing, we see those functions as in the line, and the approach to driving efficiencies in the in-line functions requires a very different approach to the way you drive efficiencies in what we call the indirect cost structures or those 13,000 that don't touch product.
We also look at our overheads and indirects in London, in Jo'burg and in all of our regional offices and on the mine sites. If you don't touch product, you're an overhead. What we have to do is clean up those structures right through the organization and eliminate duplication. So it's not 500 here, a bit here and a bit there. We've taken a holistic approach to the way we run the business and the way we've got the business structured. Clearly, as we reduce the assets, we make a big change and we can change those structures. So what we've identified from today, 151,000 employees, 13,000 in those indirect functions, that's right through to and including the mine sites. In the next couple of years we'll drop by 3,000. And in the following year, another 1,000, and that is simply a function of the efficiencies and the elimination of duplication we see across the group.
That's the focus of the work today and over the next 6 months as we, as a team, readies our new organization. The indirects that drop out of the system as a function of the sale of assets is another 2,000. Now there's 1,000 here that represent regional and corporate overheads that have worked -- that has some association with the assets that are being disposed of. But we'll have to restructure and make decisions, and we don't have to wait for the asset to be disposed of to get at those improvements. Some will go with the assets, some will -- we can move earlier. So we've shown that a little bit differently. But overall, we will drive -- from 13,000 to 9,000 is the efficiency improvement we see by getting rid of duplication and other functions that aren't adding value that we see is important. And then we get down to 7,000 as a function of the disposals. And that's how we get to 98,000 post the disposal and the restructuring of the whole overhead structure within the business.
And that's part of the key to improving our underlying productivities across the business, going into 2017 in the new structure, and that's a big part of the change that you're seeing in this organization. We very deliberately started with the engine room. In my experience in driving major change, very difficult to take the engine room and also take overheads at the same time because in fact, you create other confusion here, which manifests in massive confusion here. So we started here. We took 15% out in that first 16 months -- or first 6 months rather, and now we're going into the second phase, which has been accelerated and is certainly necessary due to market conditions. But it's also logic in terms of the change and the change approach that we've adopted. 
So with that, I'll hand across to René, and then I'll pick up the operations once René's given -- taken you through the financials."

You see the lower effective tax rate of 28% compared to 31.5% in 2014. That reflects the commodity mix with a much stronger relative contribution from De Beers, which has an effective tax rate in the low 20s, and a lower relative contribution from copper. Our effective tax rate in Chile is 36%. Underlying earnings, $0.9 billion, again, reflects the lower effective tax rate but also the lower minorities as a relative contribution from copper but also Kumba, which have significant minorities declined. 
Earnings per share of $0.70, that include $0.07 associated with one-off contribution in platinum due to the physical account. The impact at the EBIT level was ZAR 2.2 billion. CapEx went down to $2.1 billion as we are completing a number of major projects, especially Minas-Rio, but also the benefit of the focus on SIB CapEx. I will go in more detail to what we are doing in term of SIB CapEx later in my presentation.
Net debt, $13.5 billion at end of June. Again, as Mark mentioned, that before reflecting the benefit of the disposal of our 50% stake in the joint venture with Lafarge, $1.6 billion. So on a pro forma basis, $11.9 billion. 
Return on capital employed, 8%. If you go back to our Driving Value program, so look at the return on capital employed at constant June 30 prices and excluding the benefit of impairment, the return on capital employed for the first half would have been 12%. So reflecting what we are doing in term of controllable and again, excluding the assets that we are planning to dispose, 13.5% for the first 6 months.
So turning to the EBIT reconciliation on the next page. Mark mentioned the $1.9 billion of price variance. That includes $0.5 billion for copper, $133 million due to the mark-to-market adjustment in the first half. At end of June, we had 74,000 tonnes of copper provisionally priced at $2.61. 
We got the benefit the weaker currencies, most specifically the rand and the Australian dollar. The weaker rand contributed $400 million, and the Aussie dollar, $200 million. Inflation, the weighted group average was just above 3%, 3.3%.
The benefit of sales productivity and cash improvement, $700 million, but includes again the one-off in Anglo Platts of ZAR 2.2 billion. De Beers negative variance at $300 million. We reduced our level of sales to 13.3 million carats, a decline of 27% compared to the first half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx. $2 billion in the first half of 2015. We have reduced our guidance, both for this year, $4.5 billion; and for 2016. So that's already shown of $1 billion over the 2015, 2016 period. $400 million of the $1 billion reduction come from SIB CapEx. SIB CapEx and stripping will be down this year to $2.3 billion, and you see the improvement compared to '14, $2.8 billion -- $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion and if you go back to 2012, $3.2 billion. So that's the benefit of the focus on stay-in-business CapEx, both in term of efficiency but also in term of procurement.
Turning to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. In the first half of this year, we were cash positive before the payment of the final dividend in April of $700 million. And again, on a pro forma basis, net debt of $11.9 billion.
Despite the decline in commodity prices since we met back in February, we have reduced our guidance in term of net debt for the end of this year. Our previous guidance was for net debt between $13.5 billion and $14 billion. We are now projecting a level of net debt at the end of this year between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. So significant progress in term of cost saving, CapEx reduction, cash flow generation, which allow us to improve our projection in term of net debt number for the end of this year.
We have maintained a very healthy liquidity. We have raised $2.2 billion in the first half of this year. So $15 billion of liquidity at end of June. Again, with the cash received a week ago, so it's $16.6 billion liquidity at end of July. No further bond maturities for the rest of this year, $1.6 billion of maturity in '16, $0.5 billion in April and $1.1 billion at the end of 2016.
In term of impairment, Mark will give an update of where we are with Minas-Rio. As you remember, we've commissioned the project at end of 2014. We are on track in term of ramp-up. So the impairment is all driven by the sharp decline in iron ore prices earlier this year, but also the review of our projection in term of midterm and long-term iron ore prices. Thank you."

I think for those that are observing a bit more of a spring René's step, it's certainly not because of commodity prices. I think given Arsenals performance on the road early -- the first couple of months, I think he's got a view that Arsenal may challenge Chelsea for the championship this year. In my view, there's something in his Perrier water. 
It is going to be a tough 6 months. Commodity prices certainly have deteriorated since the first half, so we're going to have to continue to accelerate and work a lot harder pull costs out of the business.
Starting with safety in the operations review. We have had a disappointing first half, given the big improvements we made in that first 18 months. We are focusing on controls around our more critical risk areas. And so there's a lot of work being done there. Quite normal to see this sort of flat spot in these types of changes. The important thing now is we come through that and drive again down. And that's where the focus is across the operations.
Consistent with the focus on safety and all parts of the business that you have to manage, in terms of environment and social development, again, I think the improvement in -- or the reduction in spills and environmental incidents reflects a much more important and broader issue across the business, and that is that we're working on all parts of the business in terms of improvement. And whilst in and of itself it's only one part of the business, I think it goes with safety, environmental control, cost management, productivity, marketing, getting better prices for our product. We have to touch every part of the business if this is going to be the leading mining company. And that's what we committed to achieve. 
And in our case, where things are becoming much more difficult and challenging from a social development perspective, our ability to engage stakeholders first starts with looking after people, making sure that we're looking after their community and the environment and engaging in a constructive way in terms of all of our relationships. And it remains critical and it is strategic for us as a leadership team and as a business.
On the operating side, in terms of production, you'll see clearly that platinum benefiting from a relatively quieter industrial environment. Iron ore, making progress. A little bit disappointed in the last couple of months on the Sishen performance, but Norman and the team have got that in hand and will come back pretty strongly. In those areas where we have introduced the operating model, we're up about 26% on efficiencies. So I'm very pleased with that progress. We have to get that right across the site, and we're certainly picking up a number of elements out across the whole business.
On coal, export coal, thermal, good progress on productivity improvements. And I'll show that a little bit later. Seamus and Timber [ph] and the team have done very well. De Beers, quite deliberate in pulling back some volume from the market, so again, a consequence of deliberate action. Coal, don't forget we closed PRC at the end of last year, and Seamus and the guys have been quite selective in where they're working to make sure that we continue the improvements in coal, and I'll share that a little bit later. But also, some challenges on the hydraulics at Moranbah, which will be rectified as we do the longwall changeover come August. 
Copper, very much a water story. The operations have been improving consistently, but they are constrained at the moment with water. And that risk stays with us in the second half. On nickel, very deliberate, furnace -- the first furnace rebuild, the good news is: on time, in fact a little bit early; lower cost. The good news is we've taken the learnings from the first furnace rebuild into the second furnace rebuild and we're running 20 days ahead of schedule on the second rebuild. So I said to you about 8 months ago that we expect to be at full rate in our nickel business by middle of next year. You can probably bring that back at least 3 months, possibly 6 months. So Duncan and the team has done a fantastic job in the nickel business. And relative to what's happening across the industry, very pleased with the progress we're making there. Unfortunately, the costs are not doing what we'd like them to do but we're certainly improving our cost position.
On unit costs across the business, I think the 2 areas that we're working hard on -- Kumba is a waste story. And with the changes to configuration -- and if you remember, Norman and the team with Tony looked at the design and we turned the design configuration around. What that's allowed us to do now is to be much more flexible and move into a different pit configuration for different price scenarios. I think that works very good, so I'm very pleased with the progress there. And that's very much about -- or part of the story in terms of how Kumba's going to deal with the current challenging price environment.
And on copper, again, very much constrained in what they've done. They have continued to strip costs out but certainly, from a production point of view, that water issue is -- has had a real impact. I should say on production and cost, Duncan and the team have actually delivered on their targets for the first half. So these were expected. He's actually 1% ahead of his targets. So not a surprise and certainly expected, but the comparison against last year, obviously, a little disappointing.
In terms of operating costs across the business, we always look at local currencies in terms of what the guys are doing on-site. So on average, inflation was around 5%, so a 5% improvement in nominal terms has been good work. And foreign exchange has helped us to report a 14% reduction in U.S. dollar terms. And we have to keep the work going and continue the acceleration.
At Kumba, very much a price and waste story but the operating improvements continue to come through, albeit with a couple of disappointments. We'll move beyond that, keep driving the overall program forward. We certainly see -- we've seen some good progress on the cost front. And if I go to the next page, it tells the story better than I probably can.  
In 2014, we were delivering ore into China at $72. Yes, we've had some help from freight and other uncontrolled elements. The things Norman's working on have improved us to $56. In the second half, we expect to be around $52, which will be substantially in Norman's and the team's hands. And they have their focus and that -- I should explain and I should explain that tag there. The $8.40 a tonne is the premium over the benchmark prices that you would normally see at 62%. That reflects both quality and lump premium. If you use $7 as an average, what that says is at $52, we're breakeven at $45 a tonne. In my view, and I think Norman and I share this view and we, as a team, share the view, we need to do a lot more to make sure that we're competitive. I still have a view, and I said about 6 months ago that Norman has to get a 4 in front of his costs, I think, to be in the right ballpark. And I wouldn't argue with the premise that $40 as a breakeven cost is probably the cost that you need to get to, to be in the right ballpark. I think it's got a lot tougher and probably will get tougher. That's not a commitment as yet. That's what the -- that's what Norman and the team are working on, and we'll update you in December in terms of his progress in making sure we get those sort of numbers and what we'll look like for next year.
At Minas-Rio, solid progress in the first 4 months. Couple of issues on the filters, because as we open the pit up and we have variability of the ore, we get different ore types going through the system. Certain ores with a little bit higher alumina bog down the thickness, so you got to work out the mineralogy and the reology [ph] and the chemical requirements in making sure the filters work optimally. We've solved the problem for the first pass through the pit so we've seen a significant pickup in volumes in June, in particular, or late May, early June. And so we still believe we could hit the 11 million tonne to 14 million tonne -- can't see that there, the 11 million tonne to 14 million tonne range for the tonnes for the year.
The good news is -- for us, is that we haven't seen anything that would worry us in terms of the original price -- or cost forecast for the operation. What we have done is reflected foreign exchange movements that have gone our way. Paulo and the team are working on additional cost reductions, but given we're only halfway through the commissioning process, I think we'd be fooling ourselves and misleading you to say that we're on top of those in terms of the final outcome. We have to finish or get, I think, about 80% of the way through the commissioning process to be confident that we can do more on the cost front. But so far, we've not seen anything that worries us in terms of hitting us on those cost targets, hence, the confidence in that target. 
The key number for us is to actually hit the tonnage rate in the last quarter, because what we want to do is be at better than 80% capacity so we've got running start into 2016. I'm not particularly worried by the 1 million tonne or 2 million tonne variation. It's about making sure we're solving all the technical issues so we hit the ground running going into 2016. And certainly, I think we're making good progress on that front. And certainly, the costs all look pretty good. 
In coal, Seamus and the team continue to make solid improvements, again, losing a lot on price, picking it up back in terms of productivity and costs out of the business. So again, good progress. Made the tough call on Peace River Coal. A good option for the future but certainly not something that is competitive -- or is competitive as it needs to be today. Thinking about different ways of doing it, but a good option longer term. The cost to maintain that option is about $10 million a year so we think that's a worthwhile investment, again, thinking about the long-term positioning of the group. And from our point of view, we try and get that balance between the 2 right. So it's good work, continuing improvement we expect to see in the second half, but very good progress there.
And I'm just showing in -- this in Aussie dollars. So the cost performance in currency, I think, is always the right measure of performance. We're going from AUS 95 to AUS 75, and this is across all of our products in Australia. This is thermal and met coal. So it's the dollar per tonne. I think in met coal, we're down to something like AUS 58 to AUS 60, in that range, on the longwall, yes, on the longwall. So really significant progress but good work on the cost side.
Getting a lot tougher to squeeze extra improvements out. Seamus and the team are the first ones to adopt a formalized operating model, and that's what we call the MOS [ph], and that has been a great success. And we said that we'd expect to see at least 30% in the first 12 months. And Norman, I think we were at 26% in those areas. So good progress, and Seamus has been the leader in terms of that work and helping us across other parts of the mine.
In South Africa, Seamus took over the operations in January last year. And what we've seen is starting to see the improvements come through. Still very early days, but from that trend to that trend, we're starting to see the right things happen. A lot of work still to be done, but encouraging, nevertheless.
In copper, been a lot tougher. Water, substantially a critical issue in terms of volume. There are some issues at Collahuasi around the mill that, I think, we've now tracked the problem. So it looks like we've had a foundation problem under the main mills at Collahuasi. So the good news, I think we've got the problem. They're working on the rectification as we speak. So we think we've got that sorted.
So on a look-forward basis, water is the key. And we've done a lot of work and I think we're now -- we've now identified and we're using 70% more water from sources we've identified compared to what we had 2 years ago. But still a lot of work to be done, and we're still in the middle of a pretty significant drought. 
In nickel, again, under Duncan and the team, we've taken out costs from $6.20. If you remember in mid-2013, we did a -- or made a very significant change to the way we were running the furnaces. And we saw over a short period of time, a 20% increase in the operating volumes. That's continued. We've finished the first rebuild, learned a lot of lessons. We're now, I think, 15 to 20 days ahead on schedule. Costs are coming down. And so we believe, at full capacity now, we're looking at around $4 a pound. Again, like all of our operation, we're continuing to hunt for opportunities. But that's been a significant improvement in terms of where we are. And if we said the base was around $5.50, that's been a significant improvement in terms of that. And certainly, the progress on the furnace has been a good story.
In platinum, as you know, Chris and the guys have been very busy on about 57 different fronts. The good news is the recovery post-strike, still more to be settled but doing better. We did get a one-off adjustment. Certainly from our point of view, a good outcome. Always better to get a positive stock adjustment then a negative, so it tells us that the balances are probably leaning on the right side. But lots of work to be done and in what is typically tough market. The good news for us in particular is the long-term asset, Mogalakwena. 2012, these are the cash operating margins that you've seen. So against that price profile, that's what's happening with our margins. So significant improvement in the operations, the efficiencies of the operating level manifesting in material improvements in our margins. And so I think Chris and the team have done a great job there. And if we remember, we were at about 300,000 ounces to 320,000 ounces; first 6 months, 400,000 ounces, a record for the operation. Virtually no capital. We have had the help from the BAOBAB plant, but virtually no capital. We're doing most of this work -- in fact, all of this work that I've shown you at the moment has been focused on intellectual capital, not cash. And I think that's the important thing, and we still see more opportunities across the business. In Rustenburg, lots of work. When you go from 24,000 to 16,500, after all the noise, it's been done. And the success in terms of that program going from a ZAR 597 million cash drain in 2012, Chris and the team have turned those operations cash positive. And that change there, I think -- lost that [indiscernible]. Sorry about that -- has been significant and probably underappreciated in terms of the work. So again, against that price line, I think that performance has been very credible and certainly, from our point of view, Rustenburg has proven to be an asset that has some value. And certainly, I think Chris and the guys have done a good job. And Chris would be the first to say that he's nowhere near where we could be in terms of operations across the board. So still a lot more work and each day, they're making improvement.
At De Beers, it's been a tough couple of months. The market is certainly tightening up. What we have experienced is a flattening of demand, where we were seeing very strong demand in the last 2 or 3 years. We have seen a flattening of demand. As a consequence, we've pulled our guidance back down to 29 million carats to 31 million carats. And if you think about the market and the way volumes and sales go, we generally sell 55%, 45% in terms of distribution of sales during the course of the year. This year, it's more likely to be more like 50-50. And so with that in mind, we've pulled our volumes back, and I'll let you work out what you think the sales might be as a consequence. But we are working with our customers and all the players in the chain to see if we can manage that volume that's sitting in the midstream. And from our point of view, I think that's a very important piece of work over the next 2 or 3 months, to make sure that the market becomes stronger and that we go forward, so as we go into 2016, we've got the market in the right place and heading in the right direction for all of the key stakeholders.
In that, we provided a bit of a description of what we see in the market, particularly with the buildup of stock in the midstream. Again, working with our customers, working with our stakeholders to make sure that we're managing the areas that we touch, consistent with taking a leadership position across those areas that we lead. In terms of our response, production. New Sightholder qualification, a lot of work with our sightholders in making sure that we're providing our customers with the flexibility they need to manage through this more difficult time.
Finally, a few slides just to wrap, talking about Anglo American in the future. Today, we're well underway. We started with 68 assets, 55 today. Some of those assets have been closed. So when I talk about the 68 to 55, we have sold some assets. Generally, we've closed. We've made tough decisions on assets. We're looking -- in terms of going from 55 to 40, the dominating theme will be sales through that process. So that's a 27% reduction from where we are. Labor forces, as I said, we'll get under 98,000 across the group. With the addition of the Grosvenor and the Gahcho Kué, Minas-Rio making its contribution, we actually stick our nose up above where we have been. And so when you look at those numbers over the next 3 to 5 years, we're looking at a 50% improvement in productivity. That is a structural cost-base shift and that's absolutely critical. And in my view, that's what has really defined or supported those larger companies being successful in the longer term. And I think that's something we weren't focused on 2 years ago. And I think that in and of itself, the nature of the portfolio, the weighting to metals, precious and diamonds versus the bulks, which I think will be tough for the next 5 to 10 years with the supply situation. And that's why our niche positions are very strong; quality, cost competitive position, generally good cash generators even in those markets. But our base, precious and diamonds mix is quite unique. And certainly from our point of view, we think it positions us well off this strategy.
What that looks like from a competitive position? You'll see our businesses, diamonds, copper, nickel, straddling the midpoint of the cost curve. In fact, on an aggregated basis, we're slightly above the midpoint of the cost curve. We need to do much better. And with the changes, in particular, with the portfolio -- I'm just talking the portfolio changes now. So as we focus on the quality assets, we move our positions in a relative basis by commodity -- and I'll make that a little bit cleaner for you. So the after picture sees us straddling the midpoint of the second quartile. And that's a significant structural shift. Now we're not assuming business improvements. We're not assuming that the operating model adds any value. Just by making a structural change, which is the strategic change that we're making in this business, we shift our relative cost position. That's critical from our point of view. We believe we'll continue to make business improvements, and that should keep us up with, if not compete with, all of our competitors in the spaces we're in. But from a structural point of view, we improve our relative position.
With that, the focus on those assets that are industry-leading assets, Q1 positions remains critical to continue to improve that performance on a relative basis. That's where we are.
What does that look like? Against the numbers that we've posted in the first half, post divestments, we move that margin -- EBITDA margin to 29%. And just so you understand the cost-outs that we're talking about over the next 18 months, we improve like-for-like to about 35%. We will give you more shape and color of that towards the end of the year. Obviously, we'll have another 6 months under our belt in terms of the markets, probably going to be tougher, so that will be under pressure. But from an apples-for-apples perspective, that gives you a sense of where we're going.
Finally, in terms of the half year, production up despite mine closures. Operating unit costs down 5% in local currencies, 14% U.S. dollars. Capital spend, driven off the efficiencies and keeping a tight rein on the major projects as well as improving our efficiencies. On disposals, good to see the $1.6 billion hit the bank around, probably a little bit more than $200 million better than most people thought. Copper, in progress; platinum on a jewel track. We will continue to keep you informed when we hit significant milestones, and we'll give you another update, obviously, in December.
On delivery and in looking forward, we continue to press the foot on the accelerator in terms of driving more cost improvements in the business. In terms of EBIT improvement, we're targeting that $1.5 billion that I talked about, again, absolutely consistent with the Driving Value program. Just hope that that's easy for people to pick up in their models. And that includes, as part of the program, a 4,000-headcount reduction over the period where we're restructuring and reducing our overhead costs.
For us, when we talk about Anglo American, we believe the portfolio is unique and, in and of itself, provides shareholders with some choices relative to what we have in the business. Beyond that choice, which in and of itself is a strategic core from our point of view, the positioning of the portfolio, the restructuring of the assets and the focus on driving the best out of each of those assets, for us, provides us significant opportunity to improve where we are and position ourselves more effectively as a stand-alone unit and relative to our competitors in the commodities in which we compete.
We have no control over the price. We have to do with what the market throws at us. What we want to make sure we do is make every post a winner in a tough environment so that we're creating a more sustainable and competitive business.
We're talking about -- we talked about Driving Value. I think maybe a better way to finish this presentation is we're driving change. This is a different Anglo American. With that, happy to take questions."

I'm not suggesting that there's something there that's going to happen tomorrow. That's not the case. But if it continues to deteriorate, there may be other tough calls we have to make. We will keep an eye on all of the operations. Further, each of the executives have improvement programs to continue improving the business. And the question, then, is can you accelerate that program further? That's the conversation we're in today, as we were in November last year. So it's a constant process driving our costs, looking for every opportunity we can. Certainly, by the end of this year, we'll have done the London-type corporate changes that we've been talking to. And consistent with that, looking at where we reside, ultimately, I did say this morning, and I know it did hit one of the headlines, that we will be relocating offices. It won't be in the next few months because we've got commercial considerations. But I made really simple that I think St. James is probably too expensive for a mining company, considering this environment, and it's not the right place to be and we're going to make a change. And that goes with some of the changes we're making that's driving a very different culture across the organization. In terms of copper, Quellavaco is a great project. But in today's market, very, very tough and certainly not something that we're ready to endorse today to go forward. So we have to watch the market very carefully. Duncan and the team have done great work. Tony and his team are now going through all of that work with Duncan, making sure that all the loose bits and other opportunities that we can find to make it a better project occur. That's a work in progress. We'll give you an update in December. But very unlikely, if I could say, almost absolutely no chance of an approval this side of Christmas.

We have cut marginally the production so far, but we are implementing plans to cut it further. This is why we are lowering the guidance. The first guidance we had at the beginning of the year was 32 million carats to 34 million carats. And now we are down to 29 million carats to 31 million carats. We think this is adequate. We are always producing to market demand, and we always look forward because what we cut now will be available in 6, 7 months after that into the marketplace. Clearly, there will be some restocking before the end of the year, the beginning of next year because the backlog of polished in the marketplace will come down. So we believe today, after very careful consideration, that this is the right response. We are not going to rush. The final market demand is still there. We are -- I repeat that we are still forecasting for 2015 a stable market versus 2014, which was quite a good year. So we are adjusting. We're adjusting not dramatically but in line with what we think the market for H2 '15 and H1 '16 should be looking like."

So for example, with Rustenburg, we have developed a new strategy and clearly, that's been part of our whole approach and they remain cash positive. Obviously, it's getting tougher out there, but the operations continue to improve post destruct [ph]. So in the platinum operation, Chris, I think it's fair to say, those assets we've identified are doing pretty well. Union is still on its ramp-up plan, but the Rustenburg assets have been pretty solid. Copper, we're still on the right side. It's getting tighter, obviously, but still in the right side. In coal, most of the assets are still in the right side. So we've got a couple that we're doing work on. For example, Foxleigh, we're pulling further costs out of the Foxleigh operation. So generally, we've still got our nose above the waterline. But if we've got assets there that look like going underwater for any period of time, then we'll make tougher calls, and I think that's appropriate. At the end of the day, quite frankly, on the 55, down to 40, if 2 or 3 of those assets aren't able to be sold in the market we're in, we will close them if they're losing cash. We'll make the tough call because in the end, it's focusing on the assets that make the material difference to the business, it's the strategy we're putting in place. And people will still buy an asset that's on care and maintenance. We'll keep the option open. On the second part of the conversation in diamonds, clearly, the second half is going to be a tougher period from what we can see. So I'm hoping that we can do better, but it would be tough to deliver the same sort of result in the second half for De Beers in that environment. Does that answer your question?"

Unfortunately, we spent some capital in Minas-Rio, but we haven't got that finished yet. What we've been doing is hitting the costs at the operating level in those areas within the business. In South Africa, obviously, we've had higher inflation, but we're dealing with that and starting to turn those trends around. So we've got some different jurisdictional issues. In terms of the operations, we said the first part of the strategy was to stabilize and to get those operations on an even curve. I think we've done that pretty well and been consistent. The $1.7 billion that's being delivered actually includes the productivity benefits at a much higher revenue base. So we talk in EBIT terms, it's been a much higher revenue base as well. Don't forget, we've got a much lower revenue base today, so the productivity benefits don't give you the same bang for your buck. So we believe we can deliver the $1.5 billion. We clearly want to try and do better with that, but we want to do it in a way that's sustainable and doesn't blow the bank, and we're also making cuts on our capital on the same basis. So from a cash point of view, it's much more significant than -- obviously, the $700 million this year is a better efficiency improvement as well. So that's what we see and that's what we're working on today. And that's what we see going forward, and we will continue beyond 2016. But it's a real root-and-branch approach, if you saw, from the overhead restructuring as well. So that's where we are."

I think in the overhead structures, we've got a lot more work to do. And I think some important statistics might help with the debate. Kumba cut 60% out of their head office. Their overhead structure today is a little bit less than $2 per tonne compared to 3 of our major competitors are over $3.50 per tonne move in their overhead structure. So yes, we had a lot of stuff to take out. We're attacking those costs. At Kumba, we move a tonne of dirt 20% to 30% cheaper than our competitors in the Pilbara. We've got more opportunities to improve our cost, but when you look at the engine room and analyze the numbers, some of those numbers aren't as bad as one thinks or has the perception of. So what I've got to do is deal with the facts and work the numbers on the ground that we can see, and we know we've got a lot more work to do on the productivity side in Kumba, and that's where we think there's a big opportunity. But we should be doing even better than 20% to 30% per tonne move. So we do take that point because labor costs a lot. I'll make another statistic. We've now got the highest productivity longwall operations in Australia by some 20% against our nearest competitor. So we've moved hard in changing the nature of the business. From a competitive position in platinum, we are doing pretty well against our competitors on a pound-for-pound basis. So in nickel, we've gone from $6.20 to $4. So when you pull each commodity apart and rank us against our peers, we're starting to stand up reasonably. But there's a lot more to be done. We've got to get a lot tougher and we've got to work the next level of change a lot tougher. And the overhead restructuring, I think, is a really important message in terms of cultural changes. So I do take your point, but I also want to stand up and say put the metrics up side-by-side. We've improved significantly, a lot more to be done, but we're not that far back compared to where were a couple of years ago. Okay. Yes? [indiscernible] next, and then I'll income to René."

One of the things that",548,"Thanks, Mark. So yes, I think an important thing that we didn't to make a big story of -- so we all knew about the restructuring reductions that we made in 2013, when we took between -- around about 300,000 ounces out of the market. One of the things that we didn't to make much mention of was the reduction of 60,000 ounces last year at the Union Mine and about another 30,000 ounces at Dishaba, so areas that were loss-making. So if I just take small step back. Remember Union, we had 260,000 ounces. We reduced that in the restructuring to around about 220,000 ounces. And then we had the 2 vertical shafts and the decline section. What we were able to do -- and the decline section is always going to be a replacement as we build up reserves at the 2 vertical shafts. Last year, when those decline sections were loss-making, we shut down 60,000 ounces at Union. We also had some loss-making ounces at Dishaba. And although, we're building up that production over a couple of years in much more profitable areas at Dishaba, we shut down probably about 30,000 ounces. So we had 1,000 people that we had to redeploy across the group and reduce at the end of last year, so we did that. So what I'm describing is actually, without a lot of fanfare, we have been reducing ounces. And that's why if you see the units or the average guidance that we gave to the market of between 2.3 million and 2.4 million ounces, you actually see that we are increasing ounces at areas like Mogalakwena. But overall, the amount of ounces we're putting into the market are not increasing. That means that we're having to reduce ounces in other areas. So that's actually, I think, the right way to go about reducing volume to the market and then just to shut down loss-making areas across the group, and I think you're starting to see that coming from London as well today, in the announcements this morning. And I think it is the right way. I think it's much easier to do that than to try and shut down some of the very big mines. Although as Mark said, if we need to, we'll go that route. But we are reducing ounces on a constant basis out of our portfolio. We've already reduced our own mined ounces from 1.9 million ounces to about 1.6 million. And even as we increase out of much more profitable areas, you see us pulling back in other areas, and we'll continue to do that. The platinum price, why is it so weak? I mean, clearly is -- the market has softened quite a bit and we have seen much more uncertainty in some of our key markets, so China, Europe. And then of course, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues, with perhaps some increased strengthening of the dollar as the rate hikes come in the end of the year. So overall demand, not too bad, but the softening of the market may -- there may be some downside risk even further. And I think the point Mark made is we're going to manage the business for this environment, not some future price environment."

I forgot to tell you that we're also the #1 ranked copper processing plant with Confluencia now. So we went from 88% availability to 96%, so that puts us #1 against our major peers. So we are making improvements across the business. What we'll do in December is we'll unpack probably 3 or 4 of those key points in terms of where we see the opportunities to significantly improve, and we'll talk about some of the innovation work that we've been doing as well. But Tony will do that in the December results, which I think will be a logical progression from where we were. Rene -- we were here as well. I had you."

And given the challenges that have continued there until the last couple of months, the sort of level of confidence you have in that plan, and what -- how does that plan change again?

We'll look at whatever we can get out of it. But I think to promise anything significantly lower would not be correct. With Kumba, the plan that we put up last year is perfectly good, and we're now adjusting the plan for the lower price that every mine around the world is doing. The issue with Kumba is not the plan but the execution of the plan. And that's making sure that we have the cultural shift across the company that we get enough granular planning and that people stick to their plans. So we have -- the plan that we put up is fine. Now, we've got to make sure we stick to it, and we're making adjustments with our procedures and ultimately, with some of our people to make sure that we stick to our plans and get compliant. Kumba life, in pulling the pit back, the very high-cost material gets pushed to the back end. If you had to operate in a current price environment, then we need to see other changes beyond 2025, if you like, in the life scenario. But with Kumba as it is, essentially, its reserve runs to about 2030, so it's just really the back end."

I'd like to say thank you for making the time to be with us this morning.
Before I kick away, I just wanted to make sure I acknowledged Jim Rutherford, our NED or one of our NEDs, who's here with us today; Tony O'Neill, who's just been appointed to the board. So the old guy in the gray suit in the front row, for those wondering which is Tony; Rene, the other old guy up the front; and I'm Mark Cutifani, the young-looking fellow of the 3.
I have all of our executive colleagues here with us today, also a few other members of the team here. So thanks, guys, for the work you've done and in particular, thank you for making the time to come and talk to us.
In November last year, as an executive team, we sat down and did -- really did an uptake and a catch-up on the change programs we'd been introducing, in particular, looking at the foundation we've been setting up in terms of making Anglo American -- or positioning Anglo American for the future. The one thing that struck us at that time was the pressure on commodity prices, and we took the view that it was likely that commodity prices were going to be pressed further. Quite frankly, we didn't expect to see the route to be so dramatic but at that point in time, we agreed we needed to push the foot to the accelerator and start moving the change, given that we had established stability, or relative stability in the operations.
And so the numbers you see today reflect the work that we were getting on with post the first phase of the restructuring. And so costs out, the productivity improvements, announcements you've heard since January, where we've been cutting overheads, starting with Kumba, platinum, other parts of the business, started in November last year. We were quite in the process. We had to be, given stakeholders and the other important people that we had to connect with in those conversations. The $700 million reduction in capital, the work started -- or the next phase of work started as early as November last year. And together, we committed to pull another $1.6 billion -- or accelerate the pulling of $1.6 billion out of the cost structure.
Those changes aren't -- or are consistent with the driving of that new program. They're not new. What we've been doing is pressing the accelerator. Certainly, the capital disposals are new -- or the capital reductions are new. But in terms of operations, we were absolutely consistent with the overall program. But given the nature of the market, we've been pushing the foot to the accelerator to drive that change.
And so for us, we're in a very important juncture where we have to continue to accelerate because quite frankly, there's a good chance, and in all likelihood, the next 6 months is going to be even tougher. So for us, we've got to continue driving the change and driving that change quicker, and that will be the main focus of the presentation that we're going through with you today.
Firstly, on the financial highlights. You've seen the numbers this morning. I don't need to go back through them with you. EBIT, CapEx, success on disposals and the fact that on the EBIT number, whilst we're down 36%, if we took prices into account, we'd be down 50%. The fact that we've pulled back around $700 million on costs and productivity improvements has certainly helped. And with a little bit of help on the FX side, we've been able to do a little bit better than most people thought. As well as that, with pulling back the capital and obviously, doing a little bit better on the Tarmac proceeds, you see our net debt of $11.9 billion. I think it's the most important number on that page, along with maintenance of the dividend. 
In terms of the dividend, René will give you a little bit more color. But very simply put, we have a dividend policy. We've exceeded our net debt and cash flow targets in the first 6 months despite a $1.7 billion annualized impact on commodity prices since we spoke in February. But what we have done is we've pulled $1 billion out of our cost base, including capital, to deal with that. We've still got a lot of work to do before the end of the year to make sure that we can keep going forward. But again, we'll look at all of those things in December once we've got the market and once we see how much progress we've been able to make across the group.
In terms of the operations, what we've tried to do is present our numbers a little differently. We've had feedback that some of the Driving Value stuff is a little more complex and hard to model. So in these numbers, I'm not including the market improvements and the 2.5% to 3% improvement we have on realized prices against where we were a couple of years ago. They're not included in the numbers. And some of the other more difficult areas out there, obviously, the projects aren't there yet because we're still in commissioning phase. We'll be just showing you here is what we've actually delivered on a cumulative basis as part of the restructuring.
On the right-hand side, and this will be my only reference to the key elements of Driving Value, because we'll try and again talk to a set of numbers that are easier to model, and we'll follow up to make sure that you're able to model these numbers. 
On major projects, big change for this organization. All of our major projects from where we spoke 2 years ago are on track in terms of schedule or doing better than schedule -- and you'll see 6 months ahead in 1 case, 3 months ahead in another -- and below budget. Again, helping us reduce capital.
On operations, productivities are up 17%, costs are down 22% in U.S. dollar terms and we are continuing to focus on rebuilding our technical capability. And the announcement yesterday of Tony going to the board was a very clear message that, one, we've made significant progress, but quite frankly, I think we're only scratching the surface; and that there's a continuing commitment to getting the engine room running towards its potential. And for us, we see lots of potential.
In terms of value leakage, Peter and the team continue to do a great job in the marketing side, again, doing very well on a relative pricing basis. And overheads and other associated costs are down $600 million. And again, Paul and the team will help unpack those numbers outside the forum. Sorry, I should say the $1.7 billion improvement is the important number that you can reconcile back to the numbers we've shown you before in terms of where we've done better in the operations.
Just to present that story a little differently. What we're showing here is margins -- EBITDA margins since 2012. And we show that against the price of our commodities in U.S. dollar terms, down 25%, so clearly under pressure. We have had some help from foreign exchange, but we've also made significant improvements in productivity and costs. And so we've pulled cost out of the business. We need to do a lot more because the prices continue to deteriorate. But just wanted to show you where we've come from. And at the same time, we've improved our relative production by 9% despite closing a number of operations in platinum, coal and in other parts of the business. So for us, it's about production and productivity from the operations that we do have, and that's a central plank for the longer-term restructuring of the business and, for us, absolutely critical in terms of cash, cash flow, maintaining margins and making sure that in the long term, every one of the steps we're taking is sustainable. It's not about simply cutting out costs because you have to in a short period of time. It's doing it because you have to and making sure it's sustainable. And that's, in our view, the key for this organization to be successful in the long term.
In terms of where we're going to from here, we see $1.5 billion worth of opportunities that we believe we can grab and will grab in the next 18 months. And that $1.5 billion is also consistent with the run-rate improvement we would expect to be at, at the end of 2016 on today's prices. And so for us, it's important -- or I should say prices first half. For us, accelerating the change is absolutely critical. So in the next 18 months, operating cost reductions; restructuring the overhead base across the organization; continuing with the focus on productivity and getting the engine room to work; and making sure that our capital guidance is reduced, first $700 million this year and at least another $300 million next year, absolutely critical in terms of the change programs.
In terms of that work, it's both putting back or eliminating projects that we don't see adding value and it's about improving the efficiency of mine development consistent with the efficiency changes we've seen on the operating side. So we're getting 2 hits at each of those cost items.
Beyond 2016, I'll talk about the restructuring of the overheads and the indirects. There's another $200 million that will come beyond 2016. We will talk about our progress on assets. We had 68 assets when I first stood up in December 2013. We're down to 55 today. From our point of view, we see that going to less than 40. We see -- or will see at the same time more than a 30% reduction in labor in terms of numbers. And production will be relatively flat. In fact, it is calculated to be marginally above where we are today, which indicates an underlying productivity improvement of 50%. And that's why we'll improve our relative position on the cost curves. And again, I'll show that a little bit later.
In terms of what that means in using -- when I use half 1 -- H1 prices, on a like-for-like basis, we go from a 25% margin to a 35% or 40% improvement on a like-for-like basis. At the end of the day, none of us can forecast what prices will be. All we can do is keep taking costs out, become more efficient and position ourselves to be competitive. And we'll show you what those competitive positions look like a little bit later in the presentation.
Now in terms of restructuring the business, I have to make a couple of, I think, very important points. Now as an engineer, we started here 162,000 employees. If you remember the first presentation, I made a very simple observation: We had only hit our budget once in 10 years. We were constantly missing our production targets, our cost targets, and we had major issues on projects. So we focused on where 90% of the costs were: the engine room in terms of the operations. Or if I say it a different way and we show it a little differently here, and the 151,000 is where we are today, 90% of our costs relate to people who touch product. From exploration through to marketing, we see those functions as in the line, and the approach to driving efficiencies in the in-line functions requires a very different approach to the way you drive efficiencies in what we call the indirect cost structures or those 13,000 that don't touch product.
We also look at our overheads and indirects in London, in Jo'burg and in all of our regional offices and on the mine sites. If you don't touch product, you're an overhead. What we have to do is clean up those structures right through the organization and eliminate duplication. So it's not 500 here, a bit here and a bit there. We've taken a holistic approach to the way we run the business and the way we've got the business structured. Clearly, as we reduce the assets, we make a big change and we can change those structures. So what we've identified from today, 151,000 employees, 13,000 in those indirect functions, that's right through to and including the mine sites. In the next couple of years we'll drop by 3,000. And in the following year, another 1,000, and that is simply a function of the efficiencies and the elimination of duplication we see across the group.
That's the focus of the work today and over the next 6 months as we, as a team, readies our new organization. The indirects that drop out of the system as a function of the sale of assets is another 2,000. Now there's 1,000 here that represent regional and corporate overheads that have worked -- that has some association with the assets that are being disposed of. But we'll have to restructure and make decisions, and we don't have to wait for the asset to be disposed of to get at those improvements. Some will go with the assets, some will -- we can move earlier. So we've shown that a little bit differently. But overall, we will drive -- from 13,000 to 9,000 is the efficiency improvement we see by getting rid of duplication and other functions that aren't adding value that we see is important. And then we get down to 7,000 as a function of the disposals. And that's how we get to 98,000 post the disposal and the restructuring of the whole overhead structure within the business.
And that's part of the key to improving our underlying productivities across the business, going into 2017 in the new structure, and that's a big part of the change that you're seeing in this organization. We very deliberately started with the engine room. In my experience in driving major change, very difficult to take the engine room and also take overheads at the same time because in fact, you create other confusion here, which manifests in massive confusion here. So we started here. We took 15% out in that first 16 months -- or first 6 months rather, and now we're going into the second phase, which has been accelerated and is certainly necessary due to market conditions. But it's also logic in terms of the change and the change approach that we've adopted. 
So with that, I'll hand across to René, and then I'll pick up the operations once René's given -- taken you through the financials."

That reflects the commodi",822,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everybody. EBIT, down to $1.9 billion for the first 6 months. I will go through the usual reconciliation on the next page.
You see the lower effective tax rate of 28% compared to 31.5% in 2014. That reflects the commodity mix with a much stronger relative contribution from De Beers, which has an effective tax rate in the low 20s, and a lower relative contribution from copper. Our effective tax rate in Chile is 36%. Underlying earnings, $0.9 billion, again, reflects the lower effective tax rate but also the lower minorities as a relative contribution from copper but also Kumba, which have significant minorities declined. 
Earnings per share of $0.70, that include $0.07 associated with one-off contribution in platinum due to the physical account. The impact at the EBIT level was ZAR 2.2 billion. CapEx went down to $2.1 billion as we are completing a number of major projects, especially Minas-Rio, but also the benefit of the focus on SIB CapEx. I will go in more detail to what we are doing in term of SIB CapEx later in my presentation.
Net debt, $13.5 billion at end of June. Again, as Mark mentioned, that before reflecting the benefit of the disposal of our 50% stake in the joint venture with Lafarge, $1.6 billion. So on a pro forma basis, $11.9 billion. 
Return on capital employed, 8%. If you go back to our Driving Value program, so look at the return on capital employed at constant June 30 prices and excluding the benefit of impairment, the return on capital employed for the first half would have been 12%. So reflecting what we are doing in term of controllable and again, excluding the assets that we are planning to dispose, 13.5% for the first 6 months.
So turning to the EBIT reconciliation on the next page. Mark mentioned the $1.9 billion of price variance. That includes $0.5 billion for copper, $133 million due to the mark-to-market adjustment in the first half. At end of June, we had 74,000 tonnes of copper provisionally priced at $2.61. 
We got the benefit the weaker currencies, most specifically the rand and the Australian dollar. The weaker rand contributed $400 million, and the Aussie dollar, $200 million. Inflation, the weighted group average was just above 3%, 3.3%.
The benefit of sales productivity and cash improvement, $700 million, but includes again the one-off in Anglo Platts of ZAR 2.2 billion. De Beers negative variance at $300 million. We reduced our level of sales to 13.3 million carats, a decline of 27% compared to the first half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx. $2 billion in the first half of 2015. We have reduced our guidance, both for this year, $4.5 billion; and for 2016. So that's already shown of $1 billion over the 2015, 2016 period. $400 million of the $1 billion reduction come from SIB CapEx. SIB CapEx and stripping will be down this year to $2.3 billion, and you see the improvement compared to '14, $2.8 billion -- $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion and if you go back to 2012, $3.2 billion. So that's the benefit of the focus on stay-in-business CapEx, both in term of efficiency but also in term of procurement.
Turning to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. In the first half of this year, we were cash positive before the payment of the final dividend in April of $700 million. And again, on a pro forma basis, net debt of $11.9 billion.
Despite the decline in commodity prices since we met back in February, we have reduced our guidance in term of net debt for the end of this year. Our previous guidance was for net debt between $13.5 billion and $14 billion. We are now projecting a level of net debt at the end of this year between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. So significant progress in term of cost saving, CapEx reduction, cash flow generation, which allow us to improve our projection in term of net debt number for the end of this year.
We have maintained a very healthy liquidity. We have raised $2.2 billion in the first half of this year. So $15 billion of liquidity at end of June. Again, with the cash received a week ago, so it's $16.6 billion liquidity at end of July. No further bond maturities for the rest of this year, $1.6 billion of maturity in '16, $0.5 billion in April and $1.1 billion at the end of 2016.
In term of impairment, Mark will give an update of where we are with Minas-Rio. As you remember, we've commissioned the project at end of 2014. We are on track in term of ramp-up. So the impairment is all driven by the sharp decline in iron ore prices earlier this year, but also the review of our projection in term of midterm and long-term iron ore prices. Thank you."

I think for those that are observing a bit more of a spring René's step, it's certainly not because of commodity prices. I think given Arsenals performance on the road early -- the first couple of months, I think he's got a view that Arsenal may challenge Chelsea for the championship this year. In my view, there's something in his Perrier water. 
It is going to be a tough 6 months. Commodity prices certainly have deteriorated since the first half, so we're going to have to continue to accelerate and work a lot harder pull costs out of the business.
Starting with safety in the operations review. We have had a disappointing first half, given the big improvements we made in that first 18 months. We are focusing on controls around our more critical risk areas. And so there's a lot of work being done there. Quite normal to see this sort of flat spot in these types of changes. The important thing now is we come through that and drive again down. And that's where the focus is across the operations.
Consistent with the focus on safety and all parts of the business that you have to manage, in terms of environment and social development, again, I think the improvement in -- or the reduction in spills and environmental incidents reflects a much more important and broader issue across the business, and that is that we're working on all parts of the business in terms of improvement. And whilst in and of itself it's only one part of the business, I think it goes with safety, environmental control, cost management, productivity, marketing, getting better prices for our product. We have to touch every part of the business if this is going to be the leading mining company. And that's what we committed to achieve. 
And in our case, where things are becoming much more difficult and challenging from a social development perspective, our ability to engage stakeholders first starts with looking after people, making sure that we're looking after their community and the environment and engaging in a constructive way in terms of all of our relationships. And it remains critical and it is strategic for us as a leadership team and as a business.
On the operating side, in terms of production, you'll see clearly that platinum benefiting from a relatively quieter industrial environment. Iron ore, making progress. A little bit disappointed in the last couple of months on the Sishen performance, but Norman and the team have got that in hand and will come back pretty strongly. In those areas where we have introduced the operating model, we're up about 26% on efficiencies. So I'm very pleased with that progress. We have to get that right across the site, and we're certainly picking up a number of elements out across the whole business.
On coal, export coal, thermal, good progress on productivity improvements. And I'll show that a little bit later. Seamus and Timber [ph] and the team have done very well. De Beers, quite deliberate in pulling back some volume from the market, so again, a consequence of deliberate action. Coal, don't forget we closed PRC at the end of last year, and Seamus and the guys have been quite selective in where they're working to make sure that we continue the improvements in coal, and I'll share that a little bit later. But also, some challenges on the hydraulics at Moranbah, which will be rectified as we do the longwall changeover come August. 
Copper, very much a water story. The operations have been improving consistently, but they are constrained at the moment with water. And that risk stays with us in the second half. On nickel, very deliberate, furnace -- the first furnace rebuild, the good news is: on time, in fact a little bit early; lower cost. The good news is we've taken the learnings from the first furnace rebuild into the second furnace rebuild and we're running 20 days ahead of schedule on the second rebuild. So I said to you about 8 months ago that we expect to be at full rate in our nickel business by middle of next year. You can probably bring that back at least 3 months, possibly 6 months. So Duncan and the team has done a fantastic job in the nickel business. And relative to what's happening across the industry, very pleased with the progress we're making there. Unfortunately, the costs are not doing what we'd like them to do but we're certainly improving our cost position.
On unit costs across the business, I think the 2 areas that we're working hard on -- Kumba is a waste story. And with the changes to configuration -- and if you remember, Norman and the team with Tony looked at the design and we turned the design configuration around. What that's allowed us to do now is to be much more flexible and move into a different pit configuration for different price scenarios. I think that works very good, so I'm very pleased with the progress there. And that's very much about -- or part of the story in terms of how Kumba's going to deal with the current challenging price environment.
And on copper, again, very much constrained in what they've done. They have continued to strip costs out but certainly, from a production point of view, that water issue is -- has had a real impact. I should say on production and cost, Duncan and the team have actually delivered on their targets for the first half. So these were expected. He's actually 1% ahead of his targets. So not a surprise and certainly expected, but the comparison against last year, obviously, a little disappointing.
In terms of operating costs across the business, we always look at local currencies in terms of what the guys are doing on-site. So on average, inflation was around 5%, so a 5% improvement in nominal terms has been good work. And foreign exchange has helped us to report a 14% reduction in U.S. dollar terms. And we have to keep the work going and continue the acceleration.
At Kumba, very much a price and waste story but the operating improvements continue to come through, albeit with a couple of disappointments. We'll move beyond that, keep driving the overall program forward. We certainly see -- we've seen some good progress on the cost front. And if I go to the next page, it tells the story better than I probably can.  
In 2014, we were delivering ore into China at $72. Yes, we've had some help from freight and other uncontrolled elements. The things Norman's working on have improved us to $56. In the second half, we expect to be around $52, which will be substantially in Norman's and the team's hands. And they have their focus and that -- I should explain and I should explain that tag there. The $8.40 a tonne is the premium over the benchmark prices that you would normally see at 62%. That reflects both quality and lump premium. If you use $7 as an average, what that says is at $52, we're breakeven at $45 a tonne. In my view, and I think Norman and I share this view and we, as a team, share the view, we need to do a lot more to make sure that we're competitive. I still have a view, and I said about 6 months ago that Norman has to get a 4 in front of his costs, I think, to be in the right ballpark. And I wouldn't argue with the premise that $40 as a breakeven cost is probably the cost that you need to get to, to be in the right ballpark. I think it's got a lot tougher and probably will get tougher. That's not a commitment as yet. That's what the -- that's what Norman and the team are working on, and we'll update you in December in terms of his progress in making sure we get those sort of numbers and what we'll look like for next year.
At Minas-Rio, solid progress in the first 4 months. Couple of issues on the filters, because as we open the pit up and we have variability of the ore, we get different ore types going through the system. Certain ores with a little bit higher alumina bog down the thickness, so you got to work out the mineralogy and the reology [ph] and the chemical requirements in making sure the filters work optimally. We've solved the problem for the first pass through the pit so we've seen a significant pickup in volumes in June, in particular, or late May, early June. And so we still believe we could hit the 11 million tonne to 14 million tonne -- can't see that there, the 11 million tonne to 14 million tonne range for the tonnes for the year.
The good news is -- for us, is that we haven't seen anything that would worry us in terms of the original price -- or cost forecast for the operation. What we have done is reflected foreign exchange movements that have gone our way. Paulo and the team are working on additional cost reductions, but given we're only halfway through the commissioning process, I think we'd be fooling ourselves and misleading you to say that we're on top of those in terms of the final outcome. We have to finish or get, I think, about 80% of the way through the commissioning process to be confident that we can do more on the cost front. But so far, we've not seen anything that worries us in terms of hitting us on those cost targets, hence, the confidence in that target. 
The key number for us is to actually hit the tonnage rate in the last quarter, because what we want to do is be at better than 80% capacity so we've got running start into 2016. I'm not particularly worried by the 1 million tonne or 2 million tonne variation. It's about making sure we're solving all the technical issues so we hit the ground running going into 2016. And certainly, I think we're making good progress on that front. And certainly, the costs all look pretty good. 
In coal, Seamus and the team continue to make solid improvements, again, losing a lot on price, picking it up back in terms of productivity and costs out of the business. So again, good progress. Made the tough call on Peace River Coal. A good option for the future but certainly not something that is competitive -- or is competitive as it needs to be today. Thinking about different ways of doing it, but a good option longer term. The cost to maintain that option is about $10 million a year so we think that's a worthwhile investment, again, thinking about the long-term positioning of the group. And from our point of view, we try and get that balance between the 2 right. So it's good work, continuing improvement we expect to see in the second half, but very good progress there.
And I'm just showing in -- this in Aussie dollars. So the cost performance in currency, I think, is always the right measure of performance. We're going from AUS 95 to AUS 75, and this is across all of our products in Australia. This is thermal and met coal. So it's the dollar per tonne. I think in met coal, we're down to something like AUS 58 to AUS 60, in that range, on the longwall, yes, on the longwall. So really significant progress but good work on the cost side.
Getting a lot tougher to squeeze extra improvements out. Seamus and the team are the first ones to adopt a formalized operating model, and that's what we call the MOS [ph], and that has been a great success. And we said that we'd expect to see at least 30% in the first 12 months. And Norman, I think we were at 26% in those areas. So good progress, and Seamus has been the leader in terms of that work and helping us across other parts of the mine.
In South Africa, Seamus took over the operations in January last year. And what we've seen is starting to see the improvements come through. Still very early days, but from that trend to that trend, we're starting to see the right things happen. A lot of work still to be done, but encouraging, nevertheless.
In copper, been a lot tougher. Water, substantially a critical issue in terms of volume. There are some issues at Collahuasi around the mill that, I think, we've now tracked the problem. So it looks like we've had a foundation problem under the main mills at Collahuasi. So the good news, I think we've got the problem. They're working on the rectification as we speak. So we think we've got that sorted.
So on a look-forward basis, water is the key. And we've done a lot of work and I think we're now -- we've now identified and we're using 70% more water from sources we've identified compared to what we had 2 years ago. But still a lot of work to be done, and we're still in the middle of a pretty significant drought. 
In nickel, again, under Duncan and the team, we've taken out costs from $6.20. If you remember in mid-2013, we did a -- or made a very significant change to the way we were running the furnaces. And we saw over a short period of time, a 20% increase in the operating volumes. That's continued. We've finished the first rebuild, learned a lot of lessons. We're now, I think, 15 to 20 days ahead on schedule. Costs are coming down. And so we believe, at full capacity now, we're looking at around $4 a pound. Again, like all of our operation, we're continuing to hunt for opportunities. But that's been a significant improvement in terms of where we are. And if we said the base was around $5.50, that's been a significant improvement in terms of that. And certainly, the progress on the furnace has been a good story.
In platinum, as you know, Chris and the guys have been very busy on about 57 different fronts. The good news is the recovery post-strike, still more to be settled but doing better. We did get a one-off adjustment. Certainly from our point of view, a good outcome. Always better to get a positive stock adjustment then a negative, so it tells us that the balances are probably leaning on the right side. But lots of work to be done and in what is typically tough market. The good news for us in particular is the long-term asset, Mogalakwena. 2012, these are the cash operating margins that you've seen. So against that price profile, that's what's happening with our margins. So significant improvement in the operations, the efficiencies of the operating level manifesting in material improvements in our margins. And so I think Chris and the team have done a great job there. And if we remember, we were at about 300,000 ounces to 320,000 ounces; first 6 months, 400,000 ounces, a record for the operation. Virtually no capital. We have had the help from the BAOBAB plant, but virtually no capital. We're doing most of this work -- in fact, all of this work that I've shown you at the moment has been focused on intellectual capital, not cash. And I think that's the important thing, and we still see more opportunities across the business. In Rustenburg, lots of work. When you go from 24,000 to 16,500, after all the noise, it's been done. And the success in terms of that program going from a ZAR 597 million cash drain in 2012, Chris and the team have turned those operations cash positive. And that change there, I think -- lost that [indiscernible]. Sorry about that -- has been significant and probably underappreciated in terms of the work. So again, against that price line, I think that performance has been very credible and certainly, from our point of view, Rustenburg has proven to be an asset that has some value. And certainly, I think Chris and the guys have done a good job. And Chris would be the first to say that he's nowhere near where we could be in terms of operations across the board. So still a lot more work and each day, they're making improvement.
At De Beers, it's been a tough couple of months. The market is certainly tightening up. What we have experienced is a flattening of demand, where we were seeing very strong demand in the last 2 or 3 years. We have seen a flattening of demand. As a consequence, we've pulled our guidance back down to 29 million carats to 31 million carats. And if you think about the market and the way volumes and sales go, we generally sell 55%, 45% in terms of distribution of sales during the course of the year. This year, it's more likely to be more like 50-50. And so with that in mind, we've pulled our volumes back, and I'll let you work out what you think the sales might be as a consequence. But we are working with our customers and all the players in the chain to see if we can manage that volume that's sitting in the midstream. And from our point of view, I think that's a very important piece of work over the next 2 or 3 months, to make sure that the market becomes stronger and that we go forward, so as we go into 2016, we've got the market in the right place and heading in the right direction for all of the key stakeholders.
In that, we provided a bit of a description of what we see in the market, particularly with the buildup of stock in the midstream. Again, working with our customers, working with our stakeholders to make sure that we're managing the areas that we touch, consistent with taking a leadership position across those areas that we lead. In terms of our response, production. New Sightholder qualification, a lot of work with our sightholders in making sure that we're providing our customers with the flexibility they need to manage through this more difficult time.
Finally, a few slides just to wrap, talking about Anglo American in the future. Today, we're well underway. We started with 68 assets, 55 today. Some of those assets have been closed. So when I talk about the 68 to 55, we have sold some assets. Generally, we've closed. We've made tough decisions on assets. We're looking -- in terms of going from 55 to 40, the dominating theme will be sales through that process. So that's a 27% reduction from where we are. Labor forces, as I said, we'll get under 98,000 across the group. With the addition of the Grosvenor and the Gahcho Kué, Minas-Rio making its contribution, we actually stick our nose up above where we have been. And so when you look at those numbers over the next 3 to 5 years, we're looking at a 50% improvement in productivity. That is a structural cost-base shift and that's absolutely critical. And in my view, that's what has really defined or supported those larger companies being successful in the longer term. And I think that's something we weren't focused on 2 years ago. And I think that in and of itself, the nature of the portfolio, the weighting to metals, precious and diamonds versus the bulks, which I think will be tough for the next 5 to 10 years with the supply situation. And that's why our niche positions are very strong; quality, cost competitive position, generally good cash generators even in those markets. But our base, precious and diamonds mix is quite unique. And certainly from our point of view, we think it positions us well off this strategy.
What that looks like from a competitive position? You'll see our businesses, diamonds, copper, nickel, straddling the midpoint of the cost curve. In fact, on an aggregated basis, we're slightly above the midpoint of the cost curve. We need to do much better. And with the changes, in particular, with the portfolio -- I'm just talking the portfolio changes now. So as we focus on the quality assets, we move our positions in a relative basis by commodity -- and I'll make that a little bit cleaner for you. So the after picture sees us straddling the midpoint of the second quartile. And that's a significant structural shift. Now we're not assuming business improvements. We're not assuming that the operating model adds any value. Just by making a structural change, which is the strategic change that we're making in this business, we shift our relative cost position. That's critical from our point of view. We believe we'll continue to make business improvements, and that should keep us up with, if not compete with, all of our competitors in the spaces we're in. But from a structural point of view, we improve our relative position.
With that, the focus on those assets that are industry-leading assets, Q1 positions remains critical to continue to improve that performance on a relative basis. That's where we are.
What does that look like? Against the numbers that we've posted in the first half, post divestments, we move that margin -- EBITDA margin to 29%. And just so you understand the cost-outs that we're talking about over the next 18 months, we improve like-for-like to about 35%. We will give you more shape and color of that towards the end of the year. Obviously, we'll have another 6 months under our belt in terms of the markets, probably going to be tougher, so that will be under pressure. But from an apples-for-apples perspective, that gives you a sense of where we're going.
Finally, in terms of the half year, production up despite mine closures. Operating unit costs down 5% in local currencies, 14% U.S. dollars. Capital spend, driven off the efficiencies and keeping a tight rein on the major projects as well as improving our efficiencies. On disposals, good to see the $1.6 billion hit the bank around, probably a little bit more than $200 million better than most people thought. Copper, in progress; platinum on a jewel track. We will continue to keep you informed when we hit significant milestones, and we'll give you another update, obviously, in December.
On delivery and in looking forward, we continue to press the foot on the accelerator in terms of driving more cost improvements in the business. In terms of EBIT improvement, we're targeting that $1.5 billion that I talked about, again, absolutely consistent with the Driving Value program. Just hope that that's easy for people to pick up in their models. And that includes, as part of the program, a 4,000-headcount reduction over the period where we're restructuring and reducing our overhead costs.
For us, when we talk about Anglo American, we believe the portfolio is unique and, in and of itself, provides shareholders with some choices relative to what we have in the business. Beyond that choice, which in and of itself is a strategic core from our point of view, the positioning of the portfolio, the restructuring of the assets and the focus on driving the best out of each of those assets, for us, provides us significant opportunity to improve where we are and position ourselves more effectively as a stand-alone unit and relative to our competitors in the commodities in which we compete.
We have no control over the price. We have to do with what the market throws at us. What we want to make sure we do is make every post a winner in a tough environment so that we're creating a more sustainable and competitive business.
We're talking about -- we talked about Driving Value. I think maybe a better way to finish this presentation is we're driving change. This is a different Anglo American. With that, happy to take questions."

If that means we have to make a tough call and pull something up, we will. We won't hesitate. We have to make the tough calls. I'm not suggesting that there's something there that's going to happen tomorrow. That's not the case. But if it continues to deteriorate, there may be other tough calls we have to make. We will keep an eye on all of the operations. Further, each of the executives have improvement programs to continue improving the business. And the question, then, is can you accelerate that program further? That's the conversation we're in today, as we were in November last year. So it's a constant process driving our costs, looking for every opportunity we can. Certainly, by the end of this year, we'll have done the London-type corporate changes that we've been talking to. And consistent with that, looking at where we reside, ultimately, I did say this morning, and I know it did hit one of the headlines, that we will be relocating offices. It won't be in the next few months because we've got commercial considerations. But I made really simple that I think St. James is probably too expensive for a mining company, considering this environment, and it's not the right place to be and we're going to make a change. And that goes with some of the changes we're making that's driving a very different culture across the organization. In terms of copper, Quellavaco is a great project. But in today's market, very, very tough and certainly not something that we're ready to endorse today to go forward. So we have to watch the market very carefully. Duncan and the team have done great work. Tony and his team are now going through all of that work with Duncan, making sure that all the loose bits and other opportunities that we can find to make it a better project occur. That's a work in progress. We'll give you an update in December. But very unlikely, if I could say, almost absolutely no chance of an approval this side of Christmas. And next year, it will be about the market and the condition we have to make sure that we can support something. But certainly, not something you'd expect to see in the next few months. I hope that's clear. Menno?"

We have cut marginally the production so far, but we are implementing plans to cut it further. This is why we are lowering the guidance. The first guidance we had at the beginning of the year was 32 million carats to 34 million carats. And now we are down to 29 million carats to 31 million carats. We think this is adequate. We are always producing to market demand, and we always look forward because what we cut now will be available in 6, 7 months after that into the marketplace. Clearly, there will be some restocking before the end of the year, the beginning of next year because the backlog of polished in the marketplace will come down. So we believe today, after very careful consideration, that this is the right response. We are not going to rush. The final market demand is still there.

Obviously, it's getting tougher out there, but the operations continue to improve post destruct [ph]. So in the platinum operation, Chris, I think it's fair to say, those assets we've identified are doing pretty well. Union is still on its ramp-up plan, but the Rustenburg assets have been pretty solid. Copper, we're still on the right side. It's getting tighter, obviously, but still in the right side. In coal, most of the assets are still in the right side. So we've got a couple that we're doing work on. For example, Foxleigh, we're pulling further costs out of the Foxleigh operation. So generally, we've still got our nose above the waterline. But if we've got assets there that look like going underwater for any period of time, then we'll make tougher calls, and I think that's appropriate. At the end of the day, quite frankly, on the 55, down to 40, if 2 or 3 of those assets aren't able to be sold in the market we're in, we will close them if they're losing cash. We'll make the tough call because in the end, it's focusing on the assets that make the material difference to the business, it's the strategy we're putting in place. And people will still buy an asset that's on care and maintenance. We'll keep the option open. On the second part of the conversation in diamonds, clearly, the second half is going to be a tougher period from what we can see. So I'm hoping that we can do better, but it would be tough to deliver the same sort of result in the second half for De Beers in that environment. Does that answer your question?"

Unfortunately, we spent some capital in Minas-Rio, but we haven't got that finished yet. What we've been doing is hitting the costs at the operating level in those areas within the business. In South Africa, obviously, we've had higher inflation, but we're dealing with that and starting to turn those trends around. So we've got some different jurisdictional issues. In terms of the operations, we said the first part of the strategy was to stabilize and to get those operations on an even curve. I think we've done that pretty well and been consistent. The $1.7 billion that's being delivered actually includes the productivity benefits at a much higher revenue base. So we talk in EBIT terms, it's been a much higher revenue base as well. Don't forget, we've got a much lower revenue base today, so the productivity benefits don't give you the same bang for your buck. So we believe we can deliver the $1.5 billion. We clearly want to try and do better with that, but we want to do it in a way that's sustainable and doesn't blow the bank, and we're also making cuts on our capital on the same basis. So from a cash point of view, it's much more significant than -- obviously, the $700 million this year is a better efficiency improvement as well. So that's what we see and that's what we're working on today. And that's what we see going forward, and we will continue beyond 2016.

I think in the overhead structures, we've got a lot more work to do. And I think some important statistics might help with the debate. Kumba cut 60% out of their head office. Their overhead structure today is a little bit less than $2 per tonne compared to 3 of our major competitors are over $3.50 per tonne move in their overhead structure. So yes, we had a lot of stuff to take out. We're attacking those costs. At Kumba, we move a tonne of dirt 20% to 30% cheaper than our competitors in the Pilbara. We've got more opportunities to improve our cost, but when you look at the engine room and analyze the numbers, some of those numbers aren't as bad as one thinks or has the perception of. So what I've got to do is deal with the facts and work the numbers on the ground that we can see, and we know we've got a lot more work to do on the productivity side in Kumba, and that's where we think there's a big opportunity. But we should be doing even better than 20% to 30% per tonne move. So we do take that point because labor costs a lot. I'll make another statistic. We've now got the highest productivity longwall operations in Australia by some 20% against our nearest competitor. So we've moved hard in changing the nature of the business. From a competitive position in platinum, we are doing pretty well against our competitors on a pound-for-pound basis. So in nickel, we've gone from $6.20 to $4. So when you pull each commodity apart and rank us against our peers, we're starting to stand up reasonably. But there's a lot more to be done. We've got to get a lot tougher and we've got to work the next level of change a lot tougher. And the overhead restructuring, I think, is a really important message in terms of cultural changes. So I do take your point, but I also want to stand up and say put the metrics up side-by-side. We've improved significantly, a lot more to be done, but we're not that far back compared to where were a couple of years ago. Okay. Yes? [indiscernible] next, and then I'll come to Rene."

Going back to the potential for further cost savings, I remember Tony, in December, talking about $1.5 billion to $2 billion potentially from the new operating model. Does that still stand as the potential medium term? How much more work can be done around that number? When will we get a -- kind of a clearer view as to what that sort of medium-term uplift to the cost savings could be? And then just secondly, on platinum, let's say some of your competitors are taking action again in terms of closing capacity. Chris, do you think that there's more opportunity within the Amplat portfolio, and just can you give us an update as to why prices are quite so weak at the moment?"

So yes, I think an important thing that we didn't to make a big story of -- so we all knew about the restructuring reductions that we made in 2013, when we took between -- around about 300,000 ounces out of the market. One of the things that",548,"Thanks, Mark. So yes, I think an important thing that we didn't to make a big story of -- so we all knew about the restructuring reductions that we made in 2013, when we took between -- around about 300,000 ounces out of the market. One of the things that we didn't to make much mention of was the reduction of 60,000 ounces last year at the Union Mine and about another 30,000 ounces at Dishaba, so areas that were loss-making. So if I just take small step back. Remember Union, we had 260,000 ounces. We reduced that in the restructuring to around about 220,000 ounces. And then we had the 2 vertical shafts and the decline section. What we were able to do -- and the decline section is always going to be a replacement as we build up reserves at the 2 vertical shafts. Last year, when those decline sections were loss-making, we shut down 60,000 ounces at Union. We also had some loss-making ounces at Dishaba. And although, we're building up that production over a couple of years in much more profitable areas at Dishaba, we shut down probably about 30,000 ounces. So we had 1,000 people that we had to redeploy across the group and reduce at the end of last year, so we did that. So what I'm describing is actually, without a lot of fanfare, we have been reducing ounces. And that's why if you see the units or the average guidance that we gave to the market of between 2.3 million and 2.4 million ounces, you actually see that we are increasing ounces at areas like Mogalakwena. But overall, the amount of ounces we're putting into the market are not increasing. That means that we're having to reduce ounces in other areas. So that's actually, I think, the right way to go about reducing volume to the market and then just to shut down loss-making areas across the group, and I think you're starting to see that coming from London as well today, in the announcements this morning. And I think it is the right way. I think it's much easier to do that than to try and shut down some of the very big mines. Although as Mark said, if we need to, we'll go that route. But we are reducing ounces on a constant basis out of our portfolio. We've already reduced our own mined ounces from 1.9 million ounces to about 1.6 million. And even as we increase out of much more profitable areas, you see us pulling back in other areas, and we'll continue to do that. The platinum price, why is it so weak? I mean, clearly is -- the market has softened quite a bit and we have seen much more uncertainty in some of our key markets, so China, Europe. And then of course, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues, with perhaps some increased strengthening of the dollar as the rate hikes come in the end of the year. So overall demand, not too bad, but the softening of the market may -- there may be some downside risk even further. And I think the point Mark made is we're going to manage the business for this environment, not some future price environment."

We'll look at whatever we can get out of it. But I think to promise anything significantly lower would not be correct. With Kumba, the plan that we put up last year is perfectly good, and we're now adjusting the plan for the lower price that every mine around the world is doing. The issue with Kumba is not the plan but the execution of the plan. And that's making sure that we have the cultural shift across the company that we get enough granular planning and that people stick to their plans. So we have -- the plan that we put up is fine. Now, we've got to make sure we stick to it, and we're making adjustments with our procedures and ultimately, with some of our people to make sure that we stick to our plans and get compliant. Kumba life, in pulling the pit back, the very high-cost material gets pushed to the back end. If you had to operate in a current price environment, then we need to see other changes beyond 2025, if you like, in the life scenario. But with Kumba as it is, essentially, its reserve runs to about 2030, so it's just really the back end."

I'd like to say thank you for making the time to be with us this morning.
Before I kick away, I just wanted to make sure I acknowledged Jim Rutherford, our NED or one of our NEDs, who's here with us today; Tony O'Neill, who's just been appointed to the board. So the old guy in the gray suit in the front row, for those wondering which is Tony; Rene, the other old guy up the front; and I'm Mark Cutifani, the young-looking fellow of the 3.
I have all of our executive colleagues here with us today, also a few other members of the team here. So thanks, guys, for the work you've done and in particular, thank you for making the time to come and talk to us.
In November last year, as an executive team, we sat down and did -- really did an uptake and a catch-up on the change programs we'd been introducing, in particular, looking at the foundation we've been setting up in terms of making Anglo American -- or positioning Anglo American for the future. The one thing that struck us at that time was the pressure on commodity prices, and we took the view that it was likely that commodity prices were going to be pressed further. Quite frankly, we didn't expect to see the route to be so dramatic but at that point in time, we agreed we needed to push the foot to the accelerator and start moving the change, given that we had established stability, or relative stability in the operations.
And so the numbers you see today reflect the work that we were getting on with post the first phase of the restructuring. And so costs out, the productivity improvements, announcements you've heard since January, where we've been cutting overheads, starting with Kumba, platinum, other parts of the business, started in November last year. We were quite in the process. We had to be, given stakeholders and the other important people that we had to connect with in those conversations. The $700 million reduction in capital, the work started -- or the next phase of work started as early as November last year. And together, we committed to pull another $1.6 billion -- or accelerate the pulling of $1.6 billion out of the cost structure.
Those changes aren't -- or are consistent with the driving of that new program. They're not new. What we've been doing is pressing the accelerator. Certainly, the capital disposals are new -- or the capital reductions are new. But in terms of operations, we were absolutely consistent with the overall program. But given the nature of the market, we've been pushing the foot to the accelerator to drive that change.
And so for us, we're in a very important juncture where we have to continue to accelerate because quite frankly, there's a good chance, and in all likelihood, the next 6 months is going to be even tougher. So for us, we've got to continue driving the change and driving that change quicker, and that will be the main focus of the presentation that we're going through with you today.
Firstly, on the financial highlights. You've seen the numbers this morning. I don't need to go back through them with you. EBIT, CapEx, success on disposals and the fact that on the EBIT number, whilst we're down 36%, if we took prices into account, we'd be down 50%. The fact that we've pulled back around $700 million on costs and productivity improvements has certainly helped. And with a little bit of help on the FX side, we've been able to do a little bit better than most people thought. As well as that, with pulling back the capital and obviously, doing a little bit better on the Tarmac proceeds, you see our net debt of $11.9 billion. I think it's the most important number on that page, along with maintenance of the dividend. 
In terms of the dividend, René will give you a little bit more color. But very simply put, we have a dividend policy. We've exceeded our net debt and cash flow targets in the first 6 months despite a $1.7 billion annualized impact on commodity prices since we spoke in February. But what we have done is we've pulled $1 billion out of our cost base, including capital, to deal with that. We've still got a lot of work to do before the end of the year to make sure that we can keep going forward. But again, we'll look at all of those things in December once we've got the market and once we see how much progress we've been able to make across the group.
In terms of the operations, what we've tried to do is present our numbers a little differently. We've had feedback that some of the Driving Value stuff is a little more complex and hard to model. So in these numbers, I'm not including the market improvements and the 2.5% to 3% improvement we have on realized prices against where we were a couple of years ago. They're not included in the numbers. And some of the other more difficult areas out there, obviously, the projects aren't there yet because we're still in commissioning phase. We'll be just showing you here is what we've actually delivered on a cumulative basis as part of the restructuring.
On the right-hand side, and this will be my only reference to the key elements of Driving Value, because we'll try and again talk to a set of numbers that are easier to model, and we'll follow up to make sure that you're able to model these numbers. 
On major projects, big change for this organization. All of our major projects from where we spoke 2 years ago are on track in terms of schedule or doing better than schedule -- and you'll see 6 months ahead in 1 case, 3 months ahead in another -- and below budget. Again, helping us reduce capital.
On operations, productivities are up 17%, costs are down 22% in U.S. dollar terms and we are continuing to focus on rebuilding our technical capability. And the announcement yesterday of Tony going to the board was a very clear message that, one, we've made significant progress, but quite frankly, I think we're only scratching the surface; and that there's a continuing commitment to getting the engine room running towards its potential. And for us, we see lots of potential.
In terms of value leakage, Peter and the team continue to do a great job in the marketing side, again, doing very well on a relative pricing basis. And overheads and other associated costs are down $600 million. And again, Paul and the team will help unpack those numbers outside the forum. Sorry, I should say the $1.7 billion improvement is the important number that you can reconcile back to the numbers we've shown you before in terms of where we've done better in the operations.
Just to present that story a little differently. What we're showing here is margins -- EBITDA margins since 2012. And we show that against the price of our commodities in U.S. dollar terms, down 25%, so clearly under pressure. We have had some help from foreign exchange, but we've also made significant improvements in productivity and costs. And so we've pulled cost out of the business. We need to do a lot more because the prices continue to deteriorate. But just wanted to show you where we've come from. And at the same time, we've improved our relative production by 9% despite closing a number of operations in platinum, coal and in other parts of the business. So for us, it's about production and productivity from the operations that we do have, and that's a central plank for the longer-term restructuring of the business and, for us, absolutely critical in terms of cash, cash flow, maintaining margins and making sure that in the long term, every one of the steps we're taking is sustainable. It's not about simply cutting out costs because you have to in a short period of time. It's doing it because you have to and making sure it's sustainable. And that's, in our view, the key for this organization to be successful in the long term.
In terms of where we're going to from here, we see $1.5 billion worth of opportunities that we believe we can grab and will grab in the next 18 months. And that $1.5 billion is also consistent with the run-rate improvement we would expect to be at, at the end of 2016 on today's prices. And so for us, it's important -- or I should say prices first half. For us, accelerating the change is absolutely critical. So in the next 18 months, operating cost reductions; restructuring the overhead base across the organization; continuing with the focus on productivity and getting the engine room to work; and making sure that our capital guidance is reduced, first $700 million this year and at least another $300 million next year, absolutely critical in terms of the change programs.
In terms of that work, it's both putting back or eliminating projects that we don't see adding value and it's about improving the efficiency of mine development consistent with the efficiency changes we've seen on the operating side. So we're getting 2 hits at each of those cost items.
Beyond 2016, I'll talk about the restructuring of the overheads and the indirects. There's another $200 million that will come beyond 2016. We will talk about our progress on assets. We had 68 assets when I first stood up in December 2013. We're down to 55 today. From our point of view, we see that going to less than 40. We see -- or will see at the same time more than a 30% reduction in labor in terms of numbers. And production will be relatively flat. In fact, it is calculated to be marginally above where we are today, which indicates an underlying productivity improvement of 50%. And that's why we'll improve our relative position on the cost curves. And again, I'll show that a little bit later.
In terms of what that means in using -- when I use half 1 -- H1 prices, on a like-for-like basis, we go from a 25% margin to a 35% or 40% improvement on a like-for-like basis. At the end of the day, none of us can forecast what prices will be. All we can do is keep taking costs out, become more efficient and position ourselves to be competitive. And we'll show you what those competitive positions look like a little bit later in the presentation.
Now in terms of restructuring the business, I have to make a couple of, I think, very important points. Now as an engineer, we started here 162,000 employees. If you remember the first presentation, I made a very simple observation: We had only hit our budget once in 10 years. We were constantly missing our production targets, our cost targets, and we had major issues on projects. So we focused on where 90% of the costs were: the engine room in terms of the operations. Or if I say it a different way and we show it a little differently here, and the 151,000 is where we are today, 90% of our costs relate to people who touch product. From exploration through to marketing, we see those functions as in the line, and the approach to driving efficiencies in the in-line functions requires a very different approach to the way you drive efficiencies in what we call the indirect cost structures or those 13,000 that don't touch product.
We also look at our overheads and indirects in London, in Jo'burg and in all of our regional offices and on the mine sites. If you don't touch product, you're an overhead. What we have to do is clean up those structures right through the organization and eliminate duplication. So it's not 500 here, a bit here and a bit there. We've taken a holistic approach to the way we run the business and the way we've got the business structured. Clearly, as we reduce the assets, we make a big change and we can change those structures. So what we've identified from today, 151,000 employees, 13,000 in those indirect functions, that's right through to and including the mine sites. In the next couple of years we'll drop by 3,000. And in the following year, another 1,000, and that is simply a function of the efficiencies and the elimination of duplication we see across the group.
That's the focus of the work today and over the next 6 months as we, as a team, readies our new organization. The indirects that drop out of the system as a function of the sale of assets is another 2,000. Now there's 1,000 here that represent regional and corporate overheads that have worked -- that has some association with the assets that are being disposed of. But we'll have to restructure and make decisions, and we don't have to wait for the asset to be disposed of to get at those improvements. Some will go with the assets, some will -- we can move earlier. So we've shown that a little bit differently. But overall, we will drive -- from 13,000 to 9,000 is the efficiency improvement we see by getting rid of duplication and other functions that aren't adding value that we see is important. And then we get down to 7,000 as a function of the disposals. And that's how we get to 98,000 post the disposal and the restructuring of the whole overhead structure within the business.
And that's part of the key to improving our underlying productivities across the business, going into 2017 in the new structure, and that's a big part of the change that you're seeing in this organization. We very deliberately started with the engine room. In my experience in driving major change, very difficult to take the engine room and also take overheads at the same time because in fact, you create other confusion here, which manifests in massive confusion here. So we started here. We took 15% out in that first 16 months -- or first 6 months rather, and now we're going into the second phase, which has been accelerated and is certainly necessary due to market conditions. But it's also logic in terms of the change and the change approach that we've adopted. 
So with that, I'll hand across to René, and then I'll pick up the operations once René's given -- taken you through the financials."

That reflects the commodi",822,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everybody. EBIT, down to $1.9 billion for the first 6 months. I will go through the usual reconciliation on the next page.
You see the lower effective tax rate of 28% compared to 31.5% in 2014. That reflects the commodity mix with a much stronger relative contribution from De Beers, which has an effective tax rate in the low 20s, and a lower relative contribution from copper. Our effective tax rate in Chile is 36%. Underlying earnings, $0.9 billion, again, reflects the lower effective tax rate but also the lower minorities as a relative contribution from copper but also Kumba, which have significant minorities declined. 
Earnings per share of $0.70, that include $0.07 associated with one-off contribution in platinum due to the physical account. The impact at the EBIT level was ZAR 2.2 billion. CapEx went down to $2.1 billion as we are completing a number of major projects, especially Minas-Rio, but also the benefit of the focus on SIB CapEx. I will go in more detail to what we are doing in term of SIB CapEx later in my presentation.
Net debt, $13.5 billion at end of June. Again, as Mark mentioned, that before reflecting the benefit of the disposal of our 50% stake in the joint venture with Lafarge, $1.6 billion. So on a pro forma basis, $11.9 billion. 
Return on capital employed, 8%. If you go back to our Driving Value program, so look at the return on capital employed at constant June 30 prices and excluding the benefit of impairment, the return on capital employed for the first half would have been 12%. So reflecting what we are doing in term of controllable and again, excluding the assets that we are planning to dispose, 13.5% for the first 6 months.
So turning to the EBIT reconciliation on the next page. Mark mentioned the $1.9 billion of price variance. That includes $0.5 billion for copper, $133 million due to the mark-to-market adjustment in the first half. At end of June, we had 74,000 tonnes of copper provisionally priced at $2.61. 
We got the benefit the weaker currencies, most specifically the rand and the Australian dollar. The weaker rand contributed $400 million, and the Aussie dollar, $200 million. Inflation, the weighted group average was just above 3%, 3.3%.
The benefit of sales productivity and cash improvement, $700 million, but includes again the one-off in Anglo Platts of ZAR 2.2 billion. De Beers negative variance at $300 million. We reduced our level of sales to 13.3 million carats, a decline of 27% compared to the first half of 2014.
Turning to CapEx. $2 billion in the first half of 2015. We have reduced our guidance, both for this year, $4.5 billion; and for 2016. So that's already shown of $1 billion over the 2015, 2016 period. $400 million of the $1 billion reduction come from SIB CapEx. SIB CapEx and stripping will be down this year to $2.3 billion, and you see the improvement compared to '14, $2.8 billion -- $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion and if you go back to 2012, $3.2 billion. So that's the benefit of the focus on stay-in-business CapEx, both in term of efficiency but also in term of procurement.
Turning to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. In the first half of this year, we were cash positive before the payment of the final dividend in April of $700 million. And again, on a pro forma basis, net debt of $11.9 billion.
Despite the decline in commodity prices since we met back in February, we have reduced our guidance in term of net debt for the end of this year. Our previous guidance was for net debt between $13.5 billion and $14 billion. We are now projecting a level of net debt at the end of this year between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. So significant progress in term of cost saving, CapEx reduction, cash flow generation, which allow us to improve our projection in term of net debt number for the end of this year.
We have maintained a very healthy liquidity. We have raised $2.2 billion in the first half of this year. So $15 billion of liquidity at end of June. Again, with the cash received a week ago, so it's $16.6 billion liquidity at end of July. No further bond maturities for the rest of this year, $1.6 billion of maturity in '16, $0.5 billion in April and $1.1 billion at the end of 2016.
In term of impairment, Mark will give an update of where we are with Minas-Rio. As you remember, we've commissioned the project at end of 2014. We are on track in term of ramp-up. So the impairment is all driven by the sharp decline in iron ore prices earlier this year, but also the review of our projection in term of midterm and long-term iron ore prices. Thank you."

I think for those that are observing a bit more of a spring René's step, it's certainly not because of commodity prices. I think given Arsenals performance on the road early -- the first couple of months, I think he's got a view that Arsenal may challenge Chelsea for the championship this year. In my view, there's something in his Perrier water. 
It is going to be a tough 6 months. Commodity prices certainly have deteriorated since the first half, so we're going to have to continue to accelerate and work a lot harder pull costs out of the business.
Starting with safety in the operations review. We have had a disappointing first half, given the big improvements we made in that first 18 months. We are focusing on controls around our more critical risk areas. And so there's a lot of work being done there. Quite normal to see this sort of flat spot in these types of changes. The important thing now is we come through that and drive again down. And that's where the focus is across the operations.
Consistent with the focus on safety and all parts of the business that you have to manage, in terms of environment and social development, again, I think the improvement in -- or the reduction in spills and environmental incidents reflects a much more important and broader issue across the business, and that is that we're working on all parts of the business in terms of improvement. And whilst in and of itself it's only one part of the business, I think it goes with safety, environmental control, cost management, productivity, marketing, getting better prices for our product. We have to touch every part of the business if this is going to be the leading mining company. And that's what we committed to achieve. 
And in our case, where things are becoming much more difficult and challenging from a social development perspective, our ability to engage stakeholders first starts with looking after people, making sure that we're looking after their community and the environment and engaging in a constructive way in terms of all of our relationships. And it remains critical and it is strategic for us as a leadership team and as a business.
On the operating side, in terms of production, you'll see clearly that platinum benefiting from a relatively quieter industrial environment. Iron ore, making progress. A little bit disappointed in the last couple of months on the Sishen performance, but Norman and the team have got that in hand and will come back pretty strongly. In those areas where we have introduced the operating model, we're up about 26% on efficiencies. So I'm very pleased with that progress. We have to get that right across the site, and we're certainly picking up a number of elements out across the whole business.
On coal, export coal, thermal, good progress on productivity improvements. And I'll show that a little bit later. Seamus and Timber [ph] and the team have done very well. De Beers, quite deliberate in pulling back some volume from the market, so again, a consequence of deliberate action. Coal, don't forget we closed PRC at the end of last year, and Seamus and the guys have been quite selective in where they're working to make sure that we continue the improvements in coal, and I'll share that a little bit later. But also, some challenges on the hydraulics at Moranbah, which will be rectified as we do the longwall changeover come August. 
Copper, very much a water story. The operations have been improving consistently, but they are constrained at the moment with water. And that risk stays with us in the second half. On nickel, very deliberate, furnace -- the first furnace rebuild, the good news is: on time, in fact a little bit early; lower cost. The good news is we've taken the learnings from the first furnace rebuild into the second furnace rebuild and we're running 20 days ahead of schedule on the second rebuild. So I said to you about 8 months ago that we expect to be at full rate in our nickel business by middle of next year. You can probably bring that back at least 3 months, possibly 6 months. So Duncan and the team has done a fantastic job in the nickel business. And relative to what's happening across the industry, very pleased with the progress we're making there. Unfortunately, the costs are not doing what we'd like them to do but we're certainly improving our cost position.
On unit costs across the business, I think the 2 areas that we're working hard on -- Kumba is a waste story. And with the changes to configuration -- and if you remember, Norman and the team with Tony looked at the design and we turned the design configuration around. What that's allowed us to do now is to be much more flexible and move into a different pit configuration for different price scenarios. I think that works very good, so I'm very pleased with the progress there. And that's very much about -- or part of the story in terms of how Kumba's going to deal with the current challenging price environment.
And on copper, again, very much constrained in what they've done. They have continued to strip costs out but certainly, from a production point of view, that water issue is -- has had a real impact. I should say on production and cost, Duncan and the team have actually delivered on their targets for the first half. So these were expected. He's actually 1% ahead of his targets. So not a surprise and certainly expected, but the comparison against last year, obviously, a little disappointing.
In terms of operating costs across the business, we always look at local currencies in terms of what the guys are doing on-site. So on average, inflation was around 5%, so a 5% improvement in nominal terms has been good work. And foreign exchange has helped us to report a 14% reduction in U.S. dollar terms. And we have to keep the work going and continue the acceleration.
At Kumba, very much a price and waste story but the operating improvements continue to come through, albeit with a couple of disappointments. We'll move beyond that, keep driving the overall program forward. We certainly see -- we've seen some good progress on the cost front. And if I go to the next page, it tells the story better than I probably can.  
In 2014, we were delivering ore into China at $72. Yes, we've had some help from freight and other uncontrolled elements. The things Norman's working on have improved us to $56. In the second half, we expect to be around $52, which will be substantially in Norman's and the team's hands. And they have their focus and that -- I should explain and I should explain that tag there. The $8.40 a tonne is the premium over the benchmark prices that you would normally see at 62%. That reflects both quality and lump premium. If you use $7 as an average, what that says is at $52, we're breakeven at $45 a tonne. In my view, and I think Norman and I share this view and we, as a team, share the view, we need to do a lot more to make sure that we're competitive. I still have a view, and I said about 6 months ago that Norman has to get a 4 in front of his costs, I think, to be in the right ballpark. And I wouldn't argue with the premise that $40 as a breakeven cost is probably the cost that you need to get to, to be in the right ballpark. I think it's got a lot tougher and probably will get tougher. That's not a commitment as yet. That's what the -- that's what Norman and the team are working on, and we'll update you in December in terms of his progress in making sure we get those sort of numbers and what we'll look like for next year.
At Minas-Rio, solid progress in the first 4 months. Couple of issues on the filters, because as we open the pit up and we have variability of the ore, we get different ore types going through the system. Certain ores with a little bit higher alumina bog down the thickness, so you got to work out the mineralogy and the reology [ph] and the chemical requirements in making sure the filters work optimally. We've solved the problem for the first pass through the pit so we've seen a significant pickup in volumes in June, in particular, or late May, early June. And so we still believe we could hit the 11 million to 14 million tonne -- can't see that there, the 11 million to 14 million tonne range for the tonnes for the year.
The good news is -- for us, is that we haven't seen anything that would worry us in terms of the original price -- or cost forecast for the operation. What we have done is reflected foreign exchange movements that have gone our way. Paulo and the team are working on additional cost reductions, but given we're only halfway through the commissioning process, I think we'd be fooling ourselves and misleading you to say that we're on top of those in terms of the final outcome. We have to finish or get, I think, about 80% of the way through the commissioning process to be confident that we can do more on the cost front. But so far, we've not seen anything that worries us in terms of hitting us on those cost targets, hence, the confidence in that target. 
The key number for us is to actually hit the tonnage rate in the last quarter, because what we want to do is be at better than 80% capacity so we've got running start into 2016. I'm not particularly worried by the 1 million tonne or 2 million tonne variation. It's about making sure we're solving all the technical issues so we hit the ground running going into 2016. And certainly, I think we're making good progress on that front. And certainly, the costs all look pretty good. 
In coal, Seamus and the team continue to make solid improvements, again, losing a lot on price, picking it up back in terms of productivity and costs out of the business. So again, good progress. Made the tough call on Peace River Coal. A good option for the future but certainly not something that is competitive -- or is competitive as it needs to be today. Thinking about different ways of doing it, but a good option longer term. The cost to maintain that option is about $10 million a year so we think that's a worthwhile investment, again, thinking about the long-term positioning of the group. And from our point of view, we try and get that balance between the 2 right. So it's good work, continuing improvement we expect to see in the second half, but very good progress there.
And I'm just showing in -- this in Aussie dollars. So the cost performance in currency, I think, is always the right measure of performance. We're going from AUS 95 to AUS 75, and this is across all of our products in Australia. This is thermal and met coal. So it's the dollar per tonne. I think in met coal, we're down to something like AUS 58 to AUS 60, in that range, on the longwall, yes, on the longwall. So really significant progress but good work on the cost side.
Getting a lot tougher to squeeze extra improvements out. Seamus and the team are the first ones to adopt a formalized operating model, and that's what we call the MOS [ph], and that has been a great success. And we said that we'd expect to see at least 30% in the first 12 months. And Norman, I think we were at 26% in those areas. So good progress, and Seamus has been the leader in terms of that work and helping us across other parts of the mine.
In South Africa, Seamus took over the operations in January last year. And what we've seen is starting to see the improvements come through. Still very early days, but from that trend to that trend, we're starting to see the right things happen. A lot of work still to be done, but encouraging, nevertheless.
In copper, been a lot tougher. Water, substantially a critical issue in terms of volume. There are some issues at Collahuasi around the mill that, I think, we've now tracked the problem. So it looks like we've had a foundation problem under the main mills at Collahuasi. So the good news, I think we've got the problem. They're working on the rectification as we speak. So we think we've got that sorted.
So on a look-forward basis, water is the key. And we've done a lot of work and I think we're now -- we've now identified and we're using 70% more water from sources we've identified compared to what we had 2 years ago. But still a lot of work to be done, and we're still in the middle of a pretty significant drought. 
In nickel, again, under Duncan and the team, we've taken out costs from $6.20. If you remember in mid-2013, we did a -- or made a very significant change to the way we were running the furnaces. And we saw over a short period of time, a 20% increase in the operating volumes. That's continued. We've finished the first rebuild, learned a lot of lessons. We're now, I think, 15 to 20 days ahead on schedule. Costs are coming down. And so we believe, at full capacity now, we're looking at around $4 a pound. Again, like all of our operation, we're continuing to hunt for opportunities. But that's been a significant improvement in terms of where we are. And if we said the base was around $5.50, that's been a significant improvement in terms of that. And certainly, the progress on the furnace has been a good story.
In platinum, as you know, Chris and the guys have been very busy on about 57 different fronts. The good news is the recovery post-strike, still more to be settled but doing better. We did get a one-off adjustment. Certainly from our point of view, a good outcome. Always better to get a positive stock adjustment then a negative, so it tells us that the balances are probably leaning on the right side. But lots of work to be done and in what is typically tough market. The good news for us in particular is the long-term asset, Mogalakwena. 2012, these are the cash operating margins that you've seen. So against that price profile, that's what's happening with our margins. So significant improvement in the operations, the efficiencies of the operating level manifesting in material improvements in our margins. And so I think Chris and the team have done a great job there. And if we remember, we were at about 300,000 to 320,000 ounces; first 6 months, 400,000 ounces, a record for the operation. Virtually no capital. We have had the help from the BAOBAB plant, but virtually no capital. We're doing most of this work -- in fact, all of this work that I've shown you at the moment has been focused on intellectual capital, not cash. And I think that's the important thing, and we still see more opportunities across the business. In Rustenburg, lots of work. When you go from 24,000 to 16,500, after all the noise, it's been done. And the success in terms of that program going from a ZAR 597 million cash drain in 2012, Chris and the team have turned those operations cash positive. And that change there, I think -- lost that [indiscernible]. Sorry about that -- has been significant and probably underappreciated in terms of the work. So again, against that price line, I think that performance has been very credible and certainly, from our point of view, Rustenburg has proven to be an asset that has some value. And certainly, I think Chris and the guys have done a good job. And Chris would be the first to say that he's nowhere near where we could be in terms of operations across the board. So still a lot more work and each day, they're making improvement.
At De Beers, it's been a tough couple of months. The market is certainly tightening up. What we have experienced is a flattening of demand, where we were seeing very strong demand in the last 2 or 3 years. We have seen a flattening of demand. As a consequence, we've pulled our guidance back down to 29 million to 31 million carats. And if you think about the market and the way volumes and sales go, we generally sell 55%, 45% in terms of distribution of sales during the course of the year. This year, it's more likely to be more like 50-50. And so with that in mind, we've pulled our volumes back, and I'll let you work out what you think the sales might be as a consequence. But we are working with our customers and all the players in the chain to see if we can manage that volume that's sitting in the midstream. And from our point of view, I think that's a very important piece of work over the next 2 or 3 months, to make sure that the market becomes stronger and that we go forward, so as we go into 2016, we've got the market in the right place and heading in the right direction for all of the key stakeholders.
In that, we provided a bit of a description of what we see in the market, particularly with the buildup of stock in the midstream. Again, working with our customers, working with our stakeholders to make sure that we're managing the areas that we touch, consistent with taking a leadership position across those areas that we lead. In terms of our response, production. New Sightholder qualification, a lot of work with our sightholders in making sure that we're providing our customers with the flexibility they need to manage through this more difficult time.
Finally, a few slides just to wrap, talking about Anglo American in the future. Today, we're well underway. We started with 68 assets, 55 today. Some of those assets have been closed. So when I talk about the 68 to 55, we have sold some assets. Generally, we've closed. We've made tough decisions on assets. We're looking -- in terms of going from 55 to 40, the dominating theme will be sales through that process. So that's a 27% reduction from where we are. Labor forces, as I said, we'll get under 98,000 across the group. With the addition of the Grosvenor and the Gahcho Kué, Minas-Rio making its contribution, we actually stick our nose up above where we have been. And so when you look at those numbers over the next 3 to 5 years, we're looking at a 50% improvement in productivity. That is a structural cost-base shift and that's absolutely critical. And in my view, that's what has really defined or supported those larger companies being successful in the longer term. And I think that's something we weren't focused on 2 years ago. And I think that in and of itself, the nature of the portfolio, the weighting to metals, precious and diamonds versus the bulks, which I think will be tough for the next 5 to 10 years with the supply situation. And that's why our niche positions are very strong; quality, cost competitive position, generally good cash generators even in those markets. But our base, precious and diamonds mix is quite unique. And certainly from our point of view, we think it positions us well off this strategy.
What that looks like from a competitive position? You'll see our businesses, diamonds, copper, nickel, straddling the midpoint of the cost curve. In fact, on an aggregated basis, we're slightly above the midpoint of the cost curve. We need to do much better. And with the changes, in particular, with the portfolio -- I'm just talking the portfolio changes now. So as we focus on the quality assets, we move our positions in a relative basis by commodity -- and I'll make that a little bit cleaner for you. So the after picture sees us straddling the midpoint of the second quartile. And that's a significant structural shift. Now we're not assuming business improvements. We're not assuming that the operating model adds any value. Just by making a structural change, which is the strategic change that we're making in this business, we shift our relative cost position. That's critical from our point of view. We believe we'll continue to make business improvements, and that should keep us up with, if not compete with, all of our competitors in the spaces we're in. But from a structural point of view, we improve our relative position.
With that, the focus on those assets that are industry-leading assets, Q1 positions remains critical to continue to improve that performance on a relative basis. That's where we are.
What does that look like? Against the numbers that we've posted in the first half, post divestments, we move that margin -- EBITDA margin to 29%. And just so you understand the cost-outs that we're talking about over the next 18 months, we improve like-for-like to about 35%. We will give you more shape and color of that towards the end of the year. Obviously, we'll have another 6 months under our belt in terms of the markets, probably going to be tougher, so that will be under pressure. But from an apples-for-apples perspective, that gives you a sense of where we're going.
Finally, in terms of the half year, production up despite mine closures. Operating unit costs down 5% in local currencies, 14% U.S. dollars. Capital spend, driven off the efficiencies and keeping a tight rein on the major projects as well as improving our efficiencies. On disposals, good to see the $1.6 billion hit the bank around, probably a little bit more than $200 million better than most people thought. Copper, in progress; platinum on a jewel track. We will continue to keep you informed when we hit significant milestones, and we'll give you another update, obviously, in December.
On delivery and in looking forward, we continue to press the foot on the accelerator in terms of driving more cost improvements in the business. In terms of EBIT improvement, we're targeting that $1.5 billion that I talked about, again, absolutely consistent with the Driving Value program. Just hope that that's easy for people to pick up in their models. And that includes, as part of the program, a 4,000-headcount reduction over the period where we're restructuring and reducing our overhead costs.
For us, when we talk about Anglo American, we believe the portfolio is unique and, in and of itself, provides shareholders with some choices relative to what we have in the business. Beyond that choice, which in and of itself is a strategic core from our point of view, the positioning of the portfolio, the restructuring of the assets and the focus on driving the best out of each of those assets, for us, provides us significant opportunity to improve where we are and position ourselves more effectively as a stand-alone unit and relative to our competitors in the commodities in which we compete.
We have no control over the price. We have to do with what the market throws at us. What we want to make sure we do is make every post a winner in a tough environment so that we're creating a more sustainable and competitive business.
We're talking about -- we talked about Driving Value. I think maybe a better way to finish this presentation is we're driving change. This is a different Anglo American. With that, happy to take questions."

We will keep an eye on all of the operations. Further, each of the executives have improvement programs to continue improving the business. And the question, then, is can you accelerate that program further? That's the conversation we're in today, as we were in November last year. So it's a constant process driving our costs, looking for every opportunity we can. Certainly, by the end of this year, we'll have done the London-type corporate changes that we've been talking to. And consistent with that, looking at where we reside, ultimately, I did say this morning, and I know it did hit one of the headlines, that we will be relocating offices. It won't be in the next few months because we've got commercial considerations. But I made really simple that I think St. James is probably too expensive for a mining company, considering this environment, and it's not the right place to be and we're going to make a change. And that goes with some of the changes we're making that's driving a very different culture across the organization. In terms of copper, Quellavaco is a great project. But in today's market, very, very tough and certainly not something that we're ready to endorse today to go forward. So we have to watch the market very carefully. Duncan and the team have done great work. Tony and his team are now going through all of that work with Duncan, making sure that all the loose bits and other opportunities that we can find to make it a better project occur. That's a work in progress. We'll give you an update in December. But very unlikely, if I could say, almost absolutely no chance of an approval this side of Christmas.

So in the platinum operation, Chris, I think it's fair to say, those assets we've identified are doing pretty well. Union is still on its ramp-up plan, but the Rustenburg assets have been pretty solid. Copper, we're still on the right side. It's getting tighter, obviously, but still in the right side. In coal, most of the assets are still in the right side. So we've got a couple that we're doing work on. For example, Foxleigh, we're pulling further costs out of the Foxleigh operation. So generally, we've still got our nose above the waterline. But if we've got assets there that look like going underwater for any period of time, then we'll make tougher calls, and I think that's appropriate. At the end of the day, quite frankly, on the 55, down to 40, if 2 or 3 of those assets aren't able to be sold in the market we're in, we will close them if they're losing cash. We'll make the tough call because in the end, it's focusing on the assets that make the material difference to the business, it's the strategy we're putting in place. And people will still buy an asset that's on care and maintenance. We'll keep the option open. On the second part of the conversation in diamonds, clearly, the second half is going to be a tougher period from what we can see.

Unfortunately, we spent some capital in Minas-Rio, but we haven't got that finished yet. What we've been doing is hitting the costs at the operating level in those areas within the business. In South Africa, obviously, we've had higher inflation, but we're dealing with that and starting to turn those trends around. So we've got some different jurisdictional issues. In terms of the operations, we said the first part of the strategy was to stabilize and to get those operations on an even curve. I think we've done that pretty well and been consistent. The $1.7 billion that's being delivered actually includes the productivity benefits at a much higher revenue base. So we talk in EBIT terms, it's been a much higher revenue base as well. Don't forget, we've got a much lower revenue base today, so the productivity benefits don't give you the same bang for your buck. So we believe we can deliver the $1.5 billion. We clearly want to try and do better with that, but we want to do it in a way that's sustainable and doesn't blow the bank, and we're also making cuts on our capital on the same basis. So from a cash point of view, it's much more significant than -- obviously, the $700 million this year is a better efficiency improvement as well. So that's what we see and that's what we're working on today. And that's what we see going forward, and we will continue beyond 2016.

I think in the overhead structures, we've got a lot more work to do. And I think some important statistics might help with the debate. Kumba cut 60% out of their head office. Their overhead structure today is a little bit less than $2 per tonne compared to 3 of our major competitors are over $3.50 per tonne move in their overhead structure. So yes, we had a lot of stuff to take out. We're attacking those costs. At Kumba, we move a tonne of dirt 20% to 30% cheaper than our competitors in the Pilbara. We've got more opportunities to improve our cost, but when you look at the engine room and analyze the numbers, some of those numbers aren't as bad as one thinks or has the perception of. So what I've got to do is deal with the facts and work the numbers on the ground that we can see, and we know we've got a lot more work to do on the productivity side in Kumba, and that's where we think there's a big opportunity. But we should be doing even better than 20% to 30% per tonne move. So we do take that point because labor costs a lot. I'll make another statistic. We've now got the highest productivity longwall operations in Australia by some 20% against our nearest competitor. So we've moved hard in changing the nature of the business. From a competitive position in platinum, we are doing pretty well against our competitors on a pound-for-pound basis. So in nickel, we've gone from $6.20 to $4. So when you pull each commodity apart and rank us against our peers, we're starting to stand up reasonably. But there's a lot more to be done. We've got to get a lot tougher and we've got to work the next level of change a lot tougher. And the overhead restructuring, I think, is a really important message in terms of cultural changes. So I do take your point, but I also want to stand up and say put the metrics up side-by-side. We've improved significantly, a lot more to be done, but we're not that far back compared to where were a couple of years ago. Okay. Yes? [indiscernible] next, and then I'll come to Rene."

One of the things that",548,"Thanks, Mark. So yes, I think an important thing that we didn't to make a big story of -- so we all knew about the restructuring reductions that we made in 2013, when we took between -- around about 300,000 ounces out of the market. One of the things that we didn't to make much mention of was the reduction of 60,000 ounces last year at the Union Mine and about another 30,000 ounces at Dishaba, so areas that were loss-making. So if I just take small step back. Remember Union, we had 260,000 ounces. We reduced that in the restructuring to around about 220,000 ounces. And then we had the 2 vertical shafts and the decline section. What we were able to do -- and the decline section is always going to be a replacement as we build up reserves at the 2 vertical shafts. Last year, when those decline sections were loss-making, we shut down 60,000 ounces at Union. We also had some loss-making ounces at Dishaba. And although, we're building up that production over a couple of years in much more profitable areas at Dishaba, we shut down probably about 30,000 ounces. So we had 1,000 people that we had to redeploy across the group and reduce at the end of last year, so we did that. So what I'm describing is actually, without a lot of fanfare, we have been reducing ounces. And that's why if you see the units or the average guidance that we gave to the market of between 2.3 million and 2.4 million ounces, you actually see that we are increasing ounces at areas like Mogalakwena. But overall, the amount of ounces we're putting into the market are not increasing. That means that we're having to reduce ounces in other areas. So that's actually, I think, the right way to go about reducing volume to the market and then just to shut down loss-making areas across the group, and I think you're starting to see that coming from London as well today, in the announcements this morning. And I think it is the right way. I think it's much easier to do that than to try and shut down some of the very big mines. Although as Mark said, if we need to, we'll go that route. But we are reducing ounces on a constant basis out of our portfolio. We've already reduced our own mined ounces from 1.9 million ounces to about 1.6 million. And even as we increase out of much more profitable areas, you see us pulling back in other areas, and we'll continue to do that. The platinum price, why is it so weak? I mean, clearly is -- the market has softened quite a bit and we have seen much more uncertainty in some of our key markets, so China, Europe. And then of course, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues, with perhaps some increased strengthening of the dollar as the rate hikes come in the end of the year. So overall demand, not too bad, but the softening of the market may -- there may be some downside risk even further. And I think the point Mark made is we're going to manage the business for this environment, not some future price environment."

We'll look at whatever we can get out of it. But I think to promise anything significantly lower would not be correct. With Kumba, the plan that we put up last year is perfectly good, and we're now adjusting the plan for the lower price that every mine around the world is doing. The issue with Kumba is not the plan but the execution of the plan. And that's making sure that we have the cultural shift across the company that we get enough granular planning and that people stick to their plans. So we have -- the plan that we put up is fine. Now, we've got to make sure we stick to it, and we're making adjustments with our procedures and ultimately, with some of our people to make sure that we stick to our plans and get compliant. Kumba life, in pulling the pit back, the very high-cost material gets pushed to the back end. If you had to operate in a current price environment, then we need to see other changes beyond 2025, if you like, in the life scenario. But with Kumba as it is, essentially, its reserve runs to about 2030, so it's just really the back end."
