I'll begin this morning with a high level overview of the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Aleem to discuss the results in more detail. Following  Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the segment level and wrap up with my perspective on 2014 as a whole. 
Throughout the year, we made significant progress on several fronts, continued expense discipline and further improvement in credit quality helped to offset the impact of the sustained low rate environment on revenues and translated into core earnings growth and lower adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter continued that momentum. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72 on net income of common of $378 million. This quarter's results included $145 million legal provision to both resolved and reserve for legacy mortgage matters. We remain focus on resolving these matters on a prudent fashion, and this quarter's accrual was another step in the right direction. 
Excluding the legal provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, up 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Total revenue was up modestly relative to the prior quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat as it has been in prior quarters, with solid loan and deposit growth offset by continued margin compression. Noninterest income was up 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher mortgage-related income and good performance in investment banking. Adjusted expenses were generally stable to the prior quarter, however, down a full 7% compared to the prior year, driven by a continued expense reduction efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of. Importantly, for the full year, we reduced our expense base from 2013, as adjusted expenses were down nearly $200 million or 4% year-over-year. 
Accordingly, we met our efficiency ratio goal with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year, well below the target we set at the beginning the year. Given our out-performance in 2014 and the real revenue headwinds we face in 2015, further progress in the short term becomes much more challenging. However, we are committed to delivering further efficiency improvement this year, albeit modest to stay on track to achieve our primary long-term goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. 
Moving to the balance sheet. 
Average performing loans were up 2% on a sequential basis and 6% year-over-year, with continued momentum in C&I, commercial real estate and consumer. Deposit growth improved this quarter, up 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the prior year. A portion of this growth is seasonal and temporary nature, but our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by a better execution and enhanced capabilities. 
Our credit quality continued to improve, with NPLs down 17% and net charge-offs declining 11 basis points compared to the third quarter, both reaching new multiyear lows. While improving economic conditions have played a role in our strong asset quality performance, this is also the result of significant actions we've taken over the past several years to both derisk and diversify our balance sheet and improve the quality of our production. 
Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter, with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the financials."

Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items. The det",2149,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. 
Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items. The details of which are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation and release. These items can skew both quarterly and annual comparisons, and therefore, I will primarily focus on adjusted results to make the core trends more clear. 
Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.72, including $145 million legal provision related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters, which reflects increased legal reserves and the final settlement of a specific matter. This legal accrual was recorded as we made further progress on certain matters in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, based on what we know today, we would expect our reasonably possible legal losses in excess of reserves to decline by a roughly similar amount. 
Excluding the impact of this provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, which were 9% higher than the prior quarter and 14% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher noninterest income, a lower provision for credit losses and a slightly lower effective tax rate. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, earnings growth was driven by a 7% reduction in adjusted expenses, higher mortgage-related revenue and a lower provision expense, which, together, more than offset the loss of income from RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 18% compared to 2013, as solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and improved asset quality more than offset a reduction in mortgage production income and a 17 basis point decline in the net interest margin. 
Let's review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. 
Net interest income was stable relative to the prior quarter, as solid loan growth offset the effect on margin compression. 
Net interest margin declined 7 basis points due to the decline in commercial loans swap income and lower securities yields, which resulted from higher premium amortization as MBS cash flows increased. 
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. However, we expect further compression in this asset class given the competitive landscape and low interest rate environment. As we have said before, loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower. However, the C&I business often brings with it additional noninterest income and deposit revenue opportunities. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients needs, and therefore, maintain a disciplined focus on overall returns. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was also stable, as 8% average earning asset growth offset the 24 basis points of margin compression. 
Looking at the full year, net interest margin declined more than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, as Wholesale Banking loan growth was stronger-than-expected and yields continued to compress. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly in 2014, with 10-year rates declining 80 to 90 basis points from already low levels. 
Looking forward, we expect first quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 7 to 9 basis points from the current level, driven primarily by lower commercial loans swap income. 
In addition, all things being equal, net interest income will decline by approximately $50 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter given lower commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days coming up. 
We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. 
Adjusted noninterest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher investment banking and mortgage-related income. 
Investment banking income increased $21 million due to higher syndicated finance and M&A revenues. Mortgage production income increased $16 million on improved gain-on-sale margins and higher refinance activity, both as a result of lower rates in the quarter. 
Mortgage servicing income increased $8 million sequentially as the result of a larger servicing portfolio and higher seasonal payment activity in the fourth quarter. 
Trust and investment management income was down $9 million compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by certain seasonal and nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. In addition, service charges for deposits declined $7 million, again, largely driven by seasonal trends. 
Lastly, we incurred $5 million of net securities losses in the quarter resulting from a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income decreased $15 million due to the loss of RidgeWorth fee income, partially offset by an increase in mortgage-related revenue. 
Finally, full year noninterest income, excluding this gain-on-sale of RidgeWorth and its associated revenues, was up 4% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we are creating in our CIB business, as well as retail investment services, private wealth and credit card. 
Moving to Slide 7. 
Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of the legal provision, was stable to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $60 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2014, consistent with our pay-per-performance philosophy. 
Outside processing and software costs increase of $22 million due to higher utilization of third-party services, in addition to normal quarterly variability. 
Other noninterest expense increased $26 million, due primarily to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted cyclical costs were stable to the prior quarter and down $32 million relative to the prior year. 
Going forward, we do not anticipate these costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base, with the exception of occasional variability in operating losses. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 7%, driven by a combination of our efficiency efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 4% compared to 2013 and a full 14% compared to 2011. 
As we look to the first quarter, we currently anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical increase in 401-K and FICO expenses and also a return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefits costs. 
Bigger picture, on an annual basis, we do not expect core expenses to decline from the 2014 level given our revenue goals. However, our main focus is on the efficiency ratio, and thus, we will calibrate our expense base against the revenue environment. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.4% from 61.9% in the prior quarter, as we delivered both modest revenue growth and a slight decline in adjusted expenses. 
Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 63%, 230 basis points lower than 2013, despite the significant headwinds from lower mortgage volumes and declining net interest margin. 
For 2015, our goal is to slightly improve upon last year's 63% adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
As Bill noted earlier, progress in '15 will be significantly more difficult than '14 for a few reasons. First, we are expecting commercial loan swap income to decline by $185 million, which represents a 150 basis point headwind to our efficiency ratio. Second, as discussed on the previous slide, our core expenses have declined significantly over the past few years and we do not anticipate further declines. And lastly, having achieved a better than projected results in 2014, we are now starting from a lower base than previously expected. 
Irrespective of the short-term trajectories, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9. 
Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined another 17% sequentially, in small part, due to a transfer of $38 million of nonperforming loans to held-for-sale status, but largely due to outflows that continued to exceed inflows. This significant reduction in the nonperforming loan portfolio was achieved in conjunction with the net charge-off ratio declining 11 basis points, reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio, alongside modestly higher recoveries in the fourth quarter. 
Our allowance for credit losses declined $20 million sequentially, as the continued improvement in overall asset quality more than offset a reserve build in the Wholesale Banking segment to address uncertainty in the energy sector. While our energy and utilities clients are important to our overall CIB business, they represent only 3.5% of our loan portfolio, with 70% of the book in the utilities and power, midstream and downstream sectors, which are not as meaningfully impacted by commodity price volatility. 
Total provision expense decreased $19 million sequentially due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by the lower reserve release. 
Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-offs ratios are unlikely to sustain themselves at these levels over the long term, so we're not expecting a significant increase in 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect our loan loss provision expense in 2015 to be fairly stable to 2014. However, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in our loan portfolio, combined with the view on future economic conditions. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. 
Average performing loan growth was up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, partially offset by continued declines in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. 
C&I loan growth was broad-based and driven by both our corporate and commercial banking clients. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in both our institutional and regional businesses. Consumer loans were also higher due to growth in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect portfolios. 
During the quarter, we sold $800 million of loans and transferred another $1.1 billion of loans to held-for-sale status. The net gain or loss on the sales and transfers was immaterial. Collectively, these transactions were part of our strategy to optimize our balance sheet and improve returns. And going forward, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate loan sales to further the strategy. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8 billion or 6%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. End of period loans increased to the lower rate of $5.6 billion or 4% compared to the prior year, as we conducted approximately $4 billion of loan sales in the second half of 2014. 
Our solid loan production performance reflects our execution of targeted growth initiatives, alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets. 
Turning to deposit performance. 
Average client deposits were up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year, driven by improved and broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. While a portion of this growth is seasonal and will decline in the first quarter, the majority of the growth is core and reflects both investments we have made in client-facing platforms, such as SummitView and our Treasury & Payments Solutions offerings, and our overall increased focus on meeting more of our clients deposits needs. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 4 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. 
Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.7% due to balance sheet growth. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings. 
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as part of a longer-term process to optimize the mix between common and noncommon Tier 1 capital. We also repurchased $110 million of common stock. The cumulative actions we've taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels, should help us to further increase capital returns to shareholders. 
We submitted our 2015 capital plan earlier this month and we'll have more to report on this matter in March. 
Lastly, as of year-end, our liquidity coverage ratio continues to exceed the January 1, 2016 90% requirement. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."

Thanks, Aleem. 
And I'll draw your attention to Slide 13. 
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on our core initiatives, core growth initiatives, while holding the line on expenses. 
Looking at the numbers, net income declined 5% sequentially, but was up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven primarily by higher provision expense due to some moderating asset quality improvement. 
Total revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but was up 3% year-over-year. Net interest income increased relative to both prior periods, driven by a continued growth in loans and deposits. Noninterest income was down sequentially due to seasonally higher income in certain nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. Year-over-year, noninterest income was up 3%, driven by growth in Wealth Management related income and card fees. 
Average loans were up 0.5 percentage point on sequential basis, with double-digit growth in consumer direct, partially offset by a continued run-off in the home equity portfolio and certain loan sales during the quarter. 
Average deposits grew 3% sequentially, reflecting our increased focus on meeting more of our clients deposit needs, particularly in our affluent and high net worth businesses. 
Turning to the full year results. 
Net income was up 7%, driven by higher revenue and lower provision, partially offset by higher expenses. Total revenue increased 2%, driven primarily by a 6% growth in Wealth Management related fees, which reflects our increased investment in people, tools, technology to better meet our client needs. These investments were the primary drivers of growth and expenses year-over-year. The full year results in this business demonstrate good execution of the core strategic initiatives we've outlined in the past, improving Wealth Management related income, enhancing the growth on returns of our Consumer Lending portfolio and making critical investment in talent and technology. Heading into 2015, we want to continue our core revenue momentum. However, expense discipline will also remain important, as we continued to balance cost-reduction opportunities with selective investments for growth. 
Turning to Slide 14 in our wholesale business. 
Wholesale Banking remains a key growth engine for the company and we continued that momentum in the business for the fourth quarter. While net income declined due to an increased provision expense, revenue increased compared to the prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up 5% sequentially and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth. Adjusted noninterest income declined 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year due to lower trading income and structured finance-related fees. These trends were partially offset by higher investment banking revenue and particularly good performance given the market volatility in the fourth quarter. 
Average loan balances were up 5% when compared with the prior quarter, with growth across the entire platform. We had growth in almost all of our CIB verticals, in addition to the momentum in core commercial real estate, national corporate banking and our specialty commercial groups, in particular, auto dealer, and non-for-profit and government. 
Loan yields remained under pressure, constraining our margin. However, as we've said before, our risk-adjusted return hurdles incorporate the entire client relationship, which also includes deposits and fee income generation. For the full year, client deposits increased 10% and capital markets related fees were up 9%. 
Looking at our full year results. 
Adjusted net income increased 10%, driven by solid revenue growth and lower provision. Fees were up modestly, as lower trading and leasing income, combined with the exit of a legacy affordable housing partnership, were more than offset by a 13% growth in investment banking income. 
Our full year investment banking performance reflects broad-based growth with record or near-record results across debt and equity capital markets and M&A. The success of our platform reflects our continued investment in talent to both expand and diversify our capabilities. 
This year, we've been able to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capability to not only our larger corporate client base, but also our core commercial banking and commercial real estate projects, and that's a value proposition that's increasingly well-received. 
Looking forward, our pipelines remain healthy, and I'm confident that the wholesale organization has the momentum to drive further growth in 2015. 
Shifting to mortgage. 
Adjusted net income in the mortgage segment increased $38 million on a sequential basis, driven by growth in fee income and lower provisions. In particular, production-related income was up $16 million due to higher volumes and gain-on-sale margins as a result of lower interest rates. 
Servicing-related income was up $9 million due to the recent servicing acquisitions and a seasonal increase in payments. Adjusted expenses were up 12% sequentially due in part to the increased client activity in the quarter. 
For the full year, mortgage delivered core profitability, driven by a 35% reduction in core expenses. Revenue declined modestly, as growth in net interest income was more than offset by decline in fee income. Core mortgage production income declined 40[ph] 7% year-over-year. However, mortgage servicing income more than doubled, driven mainly by lower prepayments in the servicing portfolio in 2014. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined from triple digits in 2013 to 74% in 2014. 
Over the past year, our core mortgage business demonstrated significant improvement. This progress was driven by a lot of heavy lifting that normalized our cost base and improve our risk profile. Most of that is now complete, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to more firmly focus on the core strategies in place to meet more client needs, drive higher revenue and deliver incremental efficiency improvement. 
So before we begin the Q&A part of the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our accomplishments during the year. 
So coming into 2014, we faced several meaningful revenue headwinds, namely, the end of the mortgage refi boom and the ongoing impact of prolonged low rate environment on net interest margin. However, we remain focused on the commitments we've made it to our stakeholders and we delivered on those goals. For our clients, we increased investments in people and enhanced capabilities to better anticipate and serve their needs. For our team mates, we invested more in training and opportunities to improve their own financial well-being. For our local communities, we continued to support economic growth through purposely investments, active partnerships and volunteer commitment. Our 2014 United Way campaign was the most successful in the company's history, with team mates donating nearly $6.5 million. And for our shareholders, we delivered strong efficiency performance and a significant improvement in asset quality. The result of which was 18% earnings growth and a 10 basis points improvement in ROA. In addition, we more than doubled our capital return. 
Separately, we were able to resolve several outstanding legacy mortgage matters, and this quarter's legal provision expense is another important step in that process. 
And then finally, for all the teammates on this call, I'd like to thank them for what they've done and continued to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and our communities and our ongoing drive for delivering improved performance for our shareholders, so teammates, thank you. And Ankur, let me turn that back over to you."

The good news is we've been making investments, so this is not sort of starting from a sort of a flat surface. And the places where we've been making investments and we're seeing the results, and I'll name them sort of not necessarily in order, but sort of go around the horn. What you've obviously seen, continued progress in the investment banking part of our business and we've added more capability there, but we've also expanded that reach within our company. So we've seen, now, in a much more expanded fee generating capability out of our commercial business and out of our commercial real estate business. The investments we've made in corporate banking around the country, you're now starting to now see some of the fee generation that comes from that, so there are a lot of momentum builders in that business. Everything on the private wealth aside has continued to have momentum. We were up about 6% there. We have continued to invest in people. We have continued to invest in technology. We are sort of net in the hiring mode in that business, but we've also done things like premier bankers in our branches. And they're going to really help -- we've given them a lot more data and a lot more analytics, and they're going to help us mine what we have as an already sort of bias to the affluent and our retail system, and we're going to mine that better. And then mortgage. So and to mention, mortgage on the positive side. We're going to see some movement there. We've already seen here in the first couple of days, some refi activity. I'd love to extrapolate the next 2 days across the rest of the year, I'm not sure we can do that. But we are starting to see some activity, not only in the refinance side, but just sort of a core basic business in our retail markets as our markets improve. So there are a number of things. I mean those are sort of just of 3, but there are a number of things that we are investing. Credit card will be another on the smaller side in terms of fee generation."

And so as we think about what the revenue environment will be and how we adjust expenses against that revenue environment, if you start off with a core expectation between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion and then think about, we will adjust, we will calibrate that as revenues go up or down. Thinking about Q1 in this context, Q1 probably is up towards the top end of the quarterly range as the result of the normal seasonal effects."

It's about 3.4% of the portfolio and about 70% of that portfolio is really not significantly related to falling oil prices. I think about 50% of portfolio is utility, so that's sort of separate, a large part is midstream, that's just the transporting of oil from one place to another, not as as impacted by prices, so much lower exposure and the E&P side and the oil field services side. From a capital markets perspective and really also loan growth perspective, I mean energy has been an important part of what we do. We don't want to undermine that. But it's been sort of less than 10% of our loan growth. And the fee part of the business has been pretty consistent over the last several years, so this is not something that's been disproportionately part of the fee income business. Did some of the fee business in the fourth quarter that was energy-related not happen? Yes. That would be accurate. And a high yield markets sort of tightened up. Will some of that happen this year? Maybe. I think, actually, we are pretty well positioned. You remember we made a small acquisition of a company called Lantana, which is in the advice business. And while I don't -- I think one's sort of thing to level out a little bit, probably sort of to the latter part of this year, I think you're going to see a lot of activity actually on the energy side as people sort of reset and think about their structure. As it relates to the consumer side, I mean, I think you sort of hit it accurately. I mean relative to -- given the fact that we're not in a lot of the geographic markets that are going to be impacted more by falling oil prices, will our consumers will see sort of that increase in a tax refund equivalent of a falling oil prices. Have we seen it yet? I mean, it might be too early. I mean, I've looked closely at spending numbers and at credit card numbers and those kinds of things, so while they're marginally up, it's might be a little bit early to sort of see the total impact of that. But I have to believe that, over the course of the year, we'll see the most positive side for us, much more towards the consumer side than the risk on the energy side."

I'll begin this morning with a high-level overview of the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Aleem to discuss the results in more detail. Following  Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the segment level and wrap up with my perspectives on 2014 as a whole. 
Throughout the year, we've made significant progress on several fronts. Continued expense discipline and further improvement in credit quality helped to offset the impact of the sustained low rate environment on revenues and translated into core earnings growth and lower adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter continued that momentum. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72 on net income of common of $378 million. This quarter's results included $145 million legal provision to both resolved and reserved for legacy mortgage matters. We remain focused on resolving these matters in a prudent fashion, and this quarter's accrual was another step in the right direction. 
Excluding the legal provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, up 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Total revenue was up modestly relative to the prior quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat, as it has been in prior quarters, with solid loan and deposit growth offset by continued margin compression. Noninterest income was up 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher mortgage-related income and good performance in investment banking. Adjusted expenses were generally stable to the prior quarter, however, down a full 7% compared to the prior year, driven by continued expense reduction efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. Importantly, for the full year, we reduced our expense base from 2013, as adjusted expenses were down nearly $200 million or 4% year-over-year. 
Accordingly, we met our efficiency ratio goal with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year, well below the target we set at the beginning of the year. Given our out-performance in 2014 and the real revenue headwinds we face in 2015, further progress in the short term becomes much more challenging. However, we are committed to delivering further efficiency improvement this year, albeit modest, to stay on track to achieve our primary long-term goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were up 2% on a sequential basis and 6% year-over-year, with continued momentum in C&I, commercial real estate and Consumer. Deposit growth improved this quarter, up 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the prior year. A portion of this growth is seasonal and temporary in nature, but our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by better execution and enhanced capabilities. 
Our credit quality continue to improve, with NPLs down 17% and net charge-offs declining 11 basis points compared to the third quarter, both reaching new multiyear lows. While improving economic conditions have played a role in our strong asset quality performance, this is also the result of significant actions we've taken over the past several years to both derisk and diversify our balance sheet and improve the quality of our production. 
Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter, with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the financials."

Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items, the det",2145,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. 
Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items, the details of which are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation and release. These items can skew both quarterly and annual comparisons and, therefore, I will primarily focus on adjusted results to make the core trends more clear. 
Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.72, including $145 million legal provision related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters, which reflects increased legal reserves and the final settlement of a specific matter. This legal accrual was recorded as we made further progress on certain matters in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, based on what we know today, we would expect our reasonably possible legal losses in excess of reserves to decline by a roughly similar amount. 
Excluding the impact of this provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, which were 9% higher than the prior quarter and 14% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher noninterest income, a lower provision for credit losses and a slightly lower effective tax rate. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, earnings growth was driven by a 7% reduction in adjusted expenses, higher mortgage-related revenue and a lower provision expense which, together, more than offset the loss of income from RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 18% compared to 2013, as solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and improved asset quality more than offset a reduction in mortgage production income and a 17-basis-point decline in the net interest margin. 
Let's review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. 
Net interest income was stable relative to the prior quarter, as solid loan growth offset the effect of margin compression. 
Net interest margin declined 7 basis points due to the decline in commercial loan swap income and lower securities yields, which resulted from higher premium amortization as MBS cash flows increased. 
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. However, we expect further compression in this asset class given the competitive landscape and low interest rate environment. As we have said before, loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower. However, the C&I business often brings with it additional noninterest income and deposit revenue opportunities. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients' needs and, therefore, maintain a disciplined focus on overall returns. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was also stable, as 8% average earning asset growth offset the 24 basis points of margin compression. 
Looking at the full year, net interest margin declined more than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, as Wholesale Banking loan growth was stronger than expected and yields continued to compress. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly in 2014, with 10-year rates declining 80 to 90 basis points from already low levels. 
Looking forward, we expect first quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 7 to 9 basis points from the current level, driven primarily by lower commercial loan swap income. 
In addition, all things being equal, net interest income will decline by approximately $50 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter given lower commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days coming up. 
We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher investment banking and mortgage-related income. 
Investment banking income increased $21 million due to higher syndicated finance and M&A revenues. Mortgage production income increased $16 million on improved gain-on-sale margins and higher refinance activity, both as a result of lower rates in the quarter. 
Mortgage servicing income increased $8 million sequentially as the result of a larger servicing portfolio and higher seasonal payment activity in the fourth quarter. 
Trust and investment management income was down $9 million compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by certain seasonal and nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. In addition, service charges for deposits declined $7 million, again, largely driven by seasonal trends. 
Lastly, we incurred $5 million of net securities losses in the quarter resulting from a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income decreased $15 million due to the loss of RidgeWorth fee income, partially offset by an increase in mortgage-related revenue. 
Finally, full year noninterest income, excluding the gain-on-sale of RidgeWorth and its associated revenues, was up 4% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we're creating in our CIB business as well as retail investment services, Private Wealth and credit card. 
Moving to Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of the legal provision, was stable to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $60 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2014, consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. 
Outside processing and software costs increased $22 million due to higher utilization of third-party services, in addition to normal quarterly variability. 
Other noninterest expense increased $26 million, due primarily to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted cyclical costs were stable to the prior quarter and down $32 million relative to the prior year. 
Going forward, we do not anticipate these costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base, with the exception of occasional variability in operating losses. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 7%, driven by a combination of our efficiency efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 4% compared to 2013 and a full 14% compared to 2011. 
As we look to the first quarter, we currently anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses and also will return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefits costs. 
Bigger picture, on an annual basis, we do not expect core expenses to decline from the 2014 level given our revenue goals. However, our main focus is on the efficiency ratio and, thus, we will calibrate our expense base against the revenue environment. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.4% from 61.9% in the prior quarter, as we delivered both modest revenue growth and a slight decline in adjusted expenses. 
Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 63%, 230 basis points lower than 2013, despite the significant headwinds from lower mortgage volumes and declining net interest margin. 
For 2015, our goal is to slightly improve upon last year's 63% adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
As Bill noted earlier, progress in '15 will be significantly more difficult than '14 for a few reasons. First, we're expecting commercial loan swap income to decline by $185 million, which represents 150-basis-point headwind to our efficiency ratio. Second, as discussed on the previous slide, our core expenses have declined significantly over the past few years and we do not anticipate further declines. And lastly, having achieved a better-than-projected result in 2014, we are now starting from a lower base than previously expected. 
Irrespective of the short-term trajectory, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9. Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined another 17% sequentially, in small part, due to a transfer of $38 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale status, but largely due to outflows that continued to exceed inflows. This significant reduction in the nonperforming loan portfolio was achieved in conjunction with the net charge-off ratio declining 11 basis points, reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio, alongside modestly higher recoveries in the fourth quarter. 
Our allowance for credit losses declined $20 million sequentially, as the continued improvement in overall asset quality more than offset a reserve build in the Wholesale Banking segment to address uncertainty in the energy sector. While our energy and utilities clients are important to our overall CIB business, they represent only 3.5% of our loan portfolio, with 70% of the book in the utilities and power, midstream and downstream sectors, which are not as meaningfully impacted by commodity price volatility. 
Total provision expense decreased $19 million sequentially due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by the lower reserve release. 
Over the near term, we expect further the moderating declines in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are unlikely to sustain themselves at these levels over the long term, so we're not expecting a significant increase in 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect our loan loss provision expense in 2015 to be fairly stable to 2014. However, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in our loan portfolio, combined with a view on future economic conditions. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. Average performing loan growth was up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, partially offset by continued declines in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. 
C&I loan growth was broad-based and driven by both our Corporate and Commercial Banking clients. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in both our institutional and regional businesses. Consumer loans were also higher due to growth in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect portfolios. 
During the quarter, we sold $800 million of loans and transferred another $1.1 billion of loans to held for sale status. The net gain or loss on the sales and transfers was immaterial. Collectively, these transactions were part of our strategy to optimize our balance sheet and improve returns. And going forward, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate loan sales to further the strategy. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8 billion or 6%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. End-of-period loans increased at a lower rate of $5.6 billion or 4% compared to the prior year, as we conducted approximately $4 billion of loan sales in the second half of 2014. 
Our solid loan production performance reflects our execution of targeted growth initiatives, alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets. 
Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year, driven by improved and broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. While a portion of this growth is seasonal and will decline in the first quarter, the majority of the growth is core and reflects both: investments we have made in client-facing platforms, such as SummitView and our Treasury & Payments Solutions offerings; and our overall increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposits needs. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 4 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.7% due to balance sheet growth. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings. 
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as part of a longer-term process to optimize the mix between common and noncommon Tier 1 capital. We also repurchased $110 million of common stock. The cumulative actions we've taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels, should help us to further increase capital returns to shareholders. 
We submitted our 2015 capital plan earlier this month and we'll have more to report on this matter in March. 
Lastly, as of year-end, our liquidity coverage ratio continues to exceed the January 1, 2016 90% requirement. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."

In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on our core initiatives -- core growth initiatives, while holding the line on expenses. Looking at the num",1212,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll draw your attention to Slide 13. 
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on our core initiatives -- core growth initiatives, while holding the line on expenses. 
Looking at the numbers. Net income declined 5% sequentially, but was up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven primarily by higher provision expense due to some moderating asset quality improvement. 
Total revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but was up 3% year-over-year. Net interest income increased relative to both prior periods, driven by continued growth in loans and deposits. Noninterest income was down sequentially due to seasonally higher income and certain nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. Year-over-year, noninterest income was up 3%, driven by growth in Wealth Management-related income and card fees. 
Average loans were up by 0.5 percentage point on a sequential basis, with double-digit growth in consumer direct, partially offset by a continued run-off in the home equity portfolio and certain loan sales during the quarter. 
Average deposits grew 3% sequentially, reflecting our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit needs, particularly in our affluent and high net worth businesses. 
Turning to the full year results. Net income was up 7%, driven by higher revenue and lower provision, partially offset by higher expenses. Total revenue increased 2%, driven primarily by a 6% growth in Wealth Management-related fees, which reflects our increased investment in people, tools, technology to better meet our client needs. These investments were the primary drivers of growth and expenses year-over-year. The full year results in this business demonstrate good execution of the core strategic initiatives we've outlined in the past, improving Wealth Management-related income, enhancing the growth on returns of our Consumer Lending portfolio and making critical investments in talent and technology. Heading into 2015, we want to continue our core revenue momentum. However, expense discipline will also remain important, as we continue to balance cost-reduction opportunities with selective investments for growth. 
Turning to Slide 14 in our Wholesale business. Wholesale Banking remains a key growth engine for the company, and we continued that momentum in the business for the fourth quarter. While net income declined due to an increased provision expense, revenue increased compared to the prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up 5% sequentially and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth. Adjusted noninterest income declined 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year due to lower trading income and structured finance-related fees. These trends were partially offset by higher investment banking revenue and particularly good performance given the market volatility in the fourth quarter. 
Average loan balances were up 5% when compared to the prior quarter, with growth across the entire platform. We had growth in almost all of our CIB verticals, in addition to the momentum in core commercial real estate, national corporate banking and our specialty commercial groups, in particular, auto dealer, and not-for-profit and government. 
Loan yields remained under pressure, constraining our margin. However, as we've said before, our risk-adjusted return hurdles incorporate the entire client relationship, which also includes deposits and fee income generation. For the full year, client deposits increased 10% and capital markets-related fees were up 9%. 
Looking at our full year results. Adjusted net income increased 10%, driven by solid revenue growth and lower provision. Fees were up modestly, as lower trading and leasing income, combined with the exit of a legacy affordable housing partnership, were more than offset by a 13% growth in investment banking income. 
Our full year investment banking performance reflects broad-based growth with record or near-record results across debt and equity capital markets and M&A. The success of our platform reflects our continued investment in talent to both expand and diversify our capabilities. 
This year, we've been able to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capability to not only our larger corporate client base, but also our core Commercial Banking and commercial real estate clients, and that's a value proposition that's increasingly well received. 
Looking forward, our pipelines remain healthy, and I'm confident that the Wholesale organization has the momentum to drive further growth in 2015. 
Shifting to Mortgage. Adjusted net income in the mortgage segment increased $38 million on a sequential basis, driven by growth in fee income and lower provisions. In particular, production-related income was up $16 million due to higher volumes and gain-on-sale margins as a result of lower interest rates. 
Servicing-related income was up $9 million due to the recent servicing acquisitions and a seasonal increase in payments. Adjusted expenses were up 12% sequentially due, in part, to the increased client activity in the quarter. 
For the full year, Mortgage delivered core profitability, driven by a 35% reduction in core expenses. Revenue declined modestly, as growth in net interest income was more than offset by a decline in fee income. Core mortgage production income declined 40 -- 47% [ph] year-over-year. However, mortgage servicing income more than doubled, driven mainly by lower prepayments in the servicing portfolio in 2014. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined from triple digits in 2013 to 74% in 2014. 
Over the past year, our core Mortgage business demonstrated significant improvement. This progress was driven by a lot of heavy lifting to normalize our cost base and improve our risk profile. Most of that is now complete, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to more firmly focus on the core strategies in place to meet more client needs, drive higher revenue and deliver incremental efficiency improvement. 
But before we begin the Q&A part of the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our accomplishments during the year. 
So coming into 2014, we faced several meaningful revenue headwinds, namely, the end of the mortgage refi boom and the ongoing impact of prolonged low rate environment on net interest margin. However, we remain focused on the commitments we've made to our stakeholders and we delivered on those goals. For our clients, we increased investments in people and enhanced capabilities to better anticipate and serve their needs. For our team mates, we invested more in training and opportunities to improve their own financial well-being. For our local communities, we continued to support economic growth through purposeful investments, active partnerships and volunteer commitment. Our 2014 United Way campaign was the most successful in the company's history, with team mates donating nearly $6.5 million. And for our shareholders, we delivered strong efficiency performance and a significant improvement in asset quality. The result of which was 18% earnings growth and a 10-basis-point improvement in ROA. In addition, we more than doubled our capital return. 
Separately, we were able to resolve several outstanding legacy mortgage matters, and this quarter's legal provision expense is another important step in that process. 
And then finally, for all the teammates on this call, I'd like to thank them for what they've done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and our communities and in our ongoing drive for delivering improved performance for our shareholders. So teammates, thank you. And Ankur, let me turn that back over to you."

What -- you've obviously seen continued progress in the investment banking part of our business, and we've added more capability there, but we've also expanded that reach within our company. So we've seen, now, a much more expanded fee-generating capability out of our commercial business and out of our commercial real estate business. The investments we've made in corporate banking sort of around the country, you're starting to now see some of the fee generation that comes from that. So there are a lot of momentum builders in that business. Everything on the Private Wealth side has continued to have momentum. We're up about 6% there. We've continued to invest in people. We've continued to invest in technology. We're sort of net in a hiring mode in that business. But we've also done things like put premier bankers in our branches. And they're going to really help -- we've given them a lot more data and a lot more analytics, and they're really going to help us mine what we have as an already sort of bias to the affluent in our retail system, and we're going to mine that better. And then Mortgage. Isn't it great to mention Mortgage on the positive side? We're going to see some movement there. We've already seen, here in the first couple of days, some refi activity. I'd love to extrapolate the next 2 days across the rest of the year. I'm not sure we can do that. But we are starting to see some activity, not only in the refinance side, but just sort of the core basic business in our retail markets as our markets improve. So there are a number of things. I mean, those are sort of just 3, but there are a number of things that we're investing in. Credit card will be another on the smaller side in terms of fee generation."

It's about 3.5% of the portfolio and about 70% of that portfolio is really not significantly related to falling oil prices. I think about 50% of portfolio is utility. So that's sort of separate, a large part is midstream, that's just the transporting of oil from one place to another, that's not as impacted by prices. So much lower exposure in the E&P side and the oilfield services side. From a capital markets perspective and really also a loan growth perspective, I mean, energy has been an important part of what we do. We don't want to undermine that. But it's been sort of less than 10% of our loan growth. And the fee part of the business has been pretty consistent over the last several years, so this is not something that's been disproportionately part of the fee income business. Did some of the fee business in the fourth quarter that was energy-related not happen? Yes. That would be accurate. And a high yield markets sort of tightened up. Will some of that happen this year? Maybe. I think, actually, we're pretty well positioned. You'll remember, we made a small acquisition of a company called Lantana, which is in the advice business. And while I don't -- I think one sort of a thing to level out a little bit, probably, sort of to the latter part of this year, I think you're going to see a lot of activity actually in the energy side as people sort of reset and think about their structure. As it relates to the consumer side, I mean, I think you sort of hit it accurately. I mean, relative to -- given the fact that we're not in a lot of the geographic markets that are going to be impacted more by falling oil prices, we'll -- our consumers will see sort of that increase in -- a tax refund equivalent of falling oil prices. Have we seen it yet? I mean, it might be too early. I mean, I've looked closely at spending numbers and at credit card numbers and those kind of things. So while they're marginally up, it might be a little bit early to sort of see the total impact of that. But I have to believe that, over the course of the year, we'll see the most positive side for us arching much more towards the consumer side than the risk on the energy side."

If there are large moves one way or the other, we'll consider that in our overall balance sheet strategy. In this -- in the fourth quarter, we had some small actions. In addition, you saw the securities laws, that was basically moving Level 2 HQLA into Level 1 to make sure that we continue to stay compliant under the LCR.

And those are split, some fixed, some floating or some fixed, some aren't. And the other place that the 10-year rate affects us is in the investment portfolio. And as the rate drops, the mortgage-backed securities we have in our investment portfolio tend to prepay a little bit faster and we reinvest that cash at slightly lower rates. So with a dramatic drop in rates such as we've seen, we'll get probably a little bit more public awareness, a little bit more publicity, and some of that will happen a little bit faster. The offset to that from a NIM and net interest income perspective, of course, is increased refis and increased fee income in the Mortgage business that I am hoping will act to completely offset the drop in net interest income from lower rates."

I'll begin this morning with a high-level overview of the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Aleem to discuss the results in more detail. Following  Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the segment level and wrap up with my perspectives on 2014 as a whole. 
Throughout the year, we've made significant progress on several fronts. Continued expense discipline and further improvement in credit quality helped to offset the impact of the sustained low rate environment on revenues and translated into core earnings growth and lower adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter continued that momentum. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72 on net income of common of $378 million. This quarter's results included $145 million legal provision to both resolved and reserved for legacy mortgage matters. We remain focused on resolving these matters in a prudent fashion, and this quarter's accrual was another step in the right direction. 
Excluding the legal provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, up 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Total revenue was up modestly relative to the prior quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat, as it has been in prior quarters, with solid loan and deposit growth offset by continued margin compression. Noninterest income was up 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher mortgage-related income and good performance in investment banking. Adjusted expenses were generally stable to the prior quarter, however, down a full 7% compared to the prior year, driven by continued expense reduction efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. Importantly, for the full year, we reduced our expense base from 2013, as adjusted expenses were down nearly $200 million or 4% year-over-year. 
Accordingly, we met our efficiency ratio goal with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year, well below the target we set at the beginning of the year. Given our out-performance in 2014 and the real revenue headwinds we face in 2015, further progress in the short term becomes much more challenging. However, we are committed to delivering further efficiency improvement this year, albeit modest, to stay on track to achieve our primary long-term goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were up 2% on a sequential basis and 6% year-over-year, with continued momentum in C&I, commercial real estate and Consumer. Deposit growth improved this quarter, up 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the prior year. A portion of this growth is seasonal and temporary in nature, but our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by better execution and enhanced capabilities. 
Our credit quality continue to improve, with NPLs down 17% and net charge-offs declining 11 basis points compared to the third quarter, both reaching new multiyear lows. While improving economic conditions have played a role in our strong asset quality performance, this is also the result of significant actions we've taken over the past several years to both derisk and diversify our balance sheet and improve the quality of our production. 
Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter, with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the financials."

Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items, the det",2145,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. 
Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items, the details of which are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation and release. These items can skew both quarterly and annual comparisons and, therefore, I will primarily focus on adjusted results to make the core trends more clear. 
Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.72, including $145 million legal provision related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters, which reflects increased legal reserves and the final settlement of a specific matter. This legal accrual was recorded as we made further progress on certain matters in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, based on what we know today, we would expect our reasonably possible legal losses in excess of reserves to decline by a roughly similar amount. 
Excluding the impact of this provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, which were 9% higher than the prior quarter and 14% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher noninterest income, a lower provision for credit losses and a slightly lower effective tax rate. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, earnings growth was driven by a 7% reduction in adjusted expenses, higher mortgage-related revenue and a lower provision expense which, together, more than offset the loss of income from RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 18% compared to 2013, as solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and improved asset quality more than offset a reduction in mortgage production income and a 17-basis-point decline in the net interest margin. 
Let's review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. 
Net interest income was stable relative to the prior quarter, as solid loan growth offset the effect of margin compression. 
Net interest margin declined 7 basis points due to the decline in commercial loan swap income and lower securities yields, which resulted from higher premium amortization as MBS cash flows increased. 
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. However, we expect further compression in this asset class given the competitive landscape and low interest rate environment. As we have said before, loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower. However, the C&I business often brings with it additional noninterest income and deposit revenue opportunities. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients' needs and, therefore, maintain a disciplined focus on overall returns. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was also stable, as 8% average earning asset growth offset the 24 basis points of margin compression. 
Looking at the full year, net interest margin declined more than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, as Wholesale Banking loan growth was stronger than expected and yields continued to compress. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly in 2014, with 10-year rates declining 80 to 90 basis points from already low levels. 
Looking forward, we expect first quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 7 to 9 basis points from the current level, driven primarily by lower commercial loan swap income. 
In addition, all things being equal, net interest income will decline by approximately $50 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter given lower commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days coming up. 
We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher investment banking and mortgage-related income. 
Investment banking income increased $21 million due to higher syndicated finance and M&A revenues. Mortgage production income increased $16 million on improved gain-on-sale margins and higher refinance activity, both as a result of lower rates in the quarter. 
Mortgage servicing income increased $8 million sequentially as the result of a larger servicing portfolio and higher seasonal payment activity in the fourth quarter. 
Trust and investment management income was down $9 million compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by certain seasonal and nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. In addition, service charges for deposits declined $7 million, again, largely driven by seasonal trends. 
Lastly, we incurred $5 million of net securities losses in the quarter resulting from a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income decreased $15 million due to the loss of RidgeWorth fee income, partially offset by an increase in mortgage-related revenue. 
Finally, full year noninterest income, excluding the gain-on-sale of RidgeWorth and its associated revenues, was up 4% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we're creating in our CIB business as well as retail investment services, Private Wealth and credit card. 
Moving to Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of the legal provision, was stable to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $60 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2014, consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. 
Outside processing and software costs increased $22 million due to higher utilization of third-party services, in addition to normal quarterly variability. 
Other noninterest expense increased $26 million, due primarily to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted cyclical costs were stable to the prior quarter and down $32 million relative to the prior year. 
Going forward, we do not anticipate these costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base, with the exception of occasional variability in operating losses. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 7%, driven by a combination of our efficiency efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 4% compared to 2013 and a full 14% compared to 2011. 
As we look to the first quarter, we currently anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses and also will return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefits costs. 
Bigger picture, on an annual basis, we do not expect core expenses to decline from the 2014 level given our revenue goals. However, our main focus is on the efficiency ratio and, thus, we will calibrate our expense base against the revenue environment. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.4% from 61.9% in the prior quarter, as we delivered both modest revenue growth and a slight decline in adjusted expenses. 
Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 63%, 230 basis points lower than 2013, despite the significant headwinds from lower mortgage volumes and declining net interest margin. 
For 2015, our goal is to slightly improve upon last year's 63% adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
As Bill noted earlier, progress in '15 will be significantly more difficult than '14 for a few reasons. First, we're expecting commercial loan swap income to decline by $185 million, which represents 150-basis-point headwind to our efficiency ratio. Second, as discussed on the previous slide, our core expenses have declined significantly over the past few years and we do not anticipate further declines. And lastly, having achieved a better-than-projected result in 2014, we are now starting from a lower base than previously expected. 
Irrespective of the short-term trajectory, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9. Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined another 17% sequentially, in small part, due to a transfer of $38 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale status, but largely due to outflows that continued to exceed inflows. This significant reduction in the nonperforming loan portfolio was achieved in conjunction with the net charge-off ratio declining 11 basis points, reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio, alongside modestly higher recoveries in the fourth quarter. 
Our allowance for credit losses declined $20 million sequentially, as the continued improvement in overall asset quality more than offset a reserve build in the Wholesale Banking segment to address uncertainty in the energy sector. While our energy and utilities clients are important to our overall CIB business, they represent only 3.5% of our loan portfolio, with 70% of the book in the utilities and power, midstream and downstream sectors, which are not as meaningfully impacted by commodity price volatility. 
Total provision expense decreased $19 million sequentially due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by the lower reserve release. 
Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are unlikely to sustain themselves at these levels over the long term, so we're not expecting a significant increase in 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect our loan loss provision expense in 2015 to be fairly stable to 2014. However, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in our loan portfolio, combined with a view on future economic conditions. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. Average performing loan growth was up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, partially offset by continued declines in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. 
C&I loan growth was broad-based and driven by both our Corporate and Commercial Banking clients. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in both our institutional and regional businesses. Consumer loans were also higher due to growth in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect portfolios. 
During the quarter, we sold $800 million of loans and transferred another $1.1 billion of loans to held for sale status. The net gain or loss on the sales and transfers was immaterial. Collectively, these transactions were part of our strategy to optimize our balance sheet and improve returns. And going forward, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate loan sales to further the strategy. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8 billion or 6%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. End-of-period loans increased at a lower rate of $5.6 billion or 4% compared to the prior year, as we conducted approximately $4 billion of loan sales in the second half of 2014. 
Our solid loan production performance reflects our execution of targeted growth initiatives, alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets. 
Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year, driven by improved and broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. While a portion of this growth is seasonal and will decline in the first quarter, the majority of the growth is core and reflects both: investments we have made in client-facing platforms, such as SummitView and our Treasury & Payments Solutions offerings; and our overall increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposits needs. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 4 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.7% due to balance sheet growth. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings. 
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as part of a longer-term process to optimize the mix between common and noncommon Tier 1 capital. We also repurchased $110 million of common stock. The cumulative actions we've taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels, should help us to further increase capital returns to shareholders. 
We submitted our 2015 capital plan earlier this month and we'll have more to report on this matter in March. 
Lastly, as of year-end, our liquidity coverage ratio continues to exceed the January 1, 2016 90% requirement. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."

Looking at the num",1209,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll draw your attention to Slide 13. 
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on our core initiatives -- core growth initiatives, while holding the line on expenses. 
Looking at the numbers. Net income declined 5% sequentially, but was up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven primarily by higher provision expense due to some moderating asset quality improvement. 
Total revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but was up 3% year-over-year. Net interest income increased relative to both prior periods, driven by continued growth in loans and deposits. Noninterest income was down sequentially due to seasonally higher income and certain nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. Year-over-year, noninterest income was up 3%, driven by growth in Wealth Management-related income and card fees. 
Average loans were up by 0.5 percentage point on a sequential basis, with double-digit growth in consumer direct, partially offset by a continued run-off in the home equity portfolio and certain loan sales during the quarter. 
Average deposits grew 3% sequentially, reflecting our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit needs, particularly in our affluent and high net worth businesses. 
Turning to the full year results. Net income was up 7%, driven by higher revenue and lower provision, partially offset by higher expenses. Total revenue increased 2%, driven primarily by a 6% growth in Wealth Management-related fees, which reflects our increased investment in people, tools, technology to better meet our client needs. These investments were the primary drivers of growth and expenses year-over-year. The full year results in this business demonstrate good execution of the core strategic initiatives we've outlined in the past, improving Wealth Management-related income, enhancing the growth on returns of our Consumer Lending portfolio and making critical investments in talent and technology. Heading into 2015, we want to continue our core revenue momentum. However, expense discipline will also remain important, as we continue to balance cost-reduction opportunities with selective investments for growth. 
Turning to Slide 14 in our Wholesale business. Wholesale Banking remains a key growth engine for the company, and we continued that momentum in the business for the fourth quarter. While net income declined due to an increased provision expense, revenue increased compared to the prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up 5% sequentially and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth. Adjusted noninterest income declined 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year due to lower trading income and structured finance-related fees. These trends were partially offset by higher investment banking revenue and particularly good performance given the market volatility in the fourth quarter. 
Average loan balances were up 5% when compared to the prior quarter, with growth across the entire platform. We had growth in almost all of our CIB verticals, in addition to the momentum in core commercial real estate, national corporate banking and our specialty commercial groups, in particular, auto dealer, and not-for-profit and government. 
Loan yields remained under pressure, constraining our margin. However, as we've said before, our risk-adjusted return hurdles incorporate the entire client relationship, which also includes deposits and fee income generation. For the full year, client deposits increased 10% and capital markets-related fees were up 9%. 
Looking at our full year results. Adjusted net income increased 10%, driven by solid revenue growth and lower provision. Fees were up modestly, as lower trading and leasing income, combined with the exit of a legacy affordable housing partnership, were more than offset by a 13% growth in investment banking income. 
Our full year investment banking performance reflects broad-based growth with record or near-record results across debt and equity capital markets and M&A. The success of our platform reflects our continued investment in talent to both expand and diversify our capabilities. 
This year, we've been able to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capability to not only our larger corporate client base, but also our core Commercial Banking and commercial real estate clients, and that's a value proposition that's increasingly well received. 
Looking forward, our pipelines remain healthy, and I'm confident that the Wholesale organization has the momentum to drive further growth in 2015. 
Shifting to Mortgage. Adjusted net income in the mortgage segment increased $38 million on a sequential basis, driven by growth in fee income and lower provision. In particular, production-related income was up $16 million due to higher volume and gain-on-sale margins as a result of lower interest rates. 
Servicing-related income was up $9 million due to the recent servicing acquisitions and a seasonal increase in payments. Adjusted expenses were up 12% sequentially due, in part, to the increased client activity in the quarter. 
For the full year, Mortgage delivered core profitability, driven by a 35% reduction in core expenses. Revenue declined modestly, as growth in net interest income was more than offset by a decline in fee income. Core mortgage production income declined 47% [ph] year-over-year. However, mortgage servicing income more than doubled, driven mainly by lower prepayments in the servicing portfolio in 2014. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined from triple digits in 2013 to 74% in 2014. 
Over the past year, our core Mortgage business demonstrated significant improvement. This progress was driven by a lot of heavy lifting to normalize our cost base and improve our risk profile. Most of that is now complete, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to more firmly focus on the core strategies in place to meet more client needs, drive higher revenue and deliver incremental efficiency improvement. 
But before we begin the Q&A part of the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our accomplishments during the year. 
So coming into 2014, we faced several meaningful revenue headwinds, namely, the end of the mortgage refi boom and the ongoing impact of prolonged low rate environment on net interest margin. However, we remain focused on the commitments we've made to our stakeholders and we delivered on those goals. For our clients, we increased investments in people and enhanced capabilities to better anticipate and serve their needs. For our team mates, we invested more in training and opportunities to improve their own financial well-being. For our local communities, we continued to support economic growth through purposeful investments, active partnerships and volunteer commitment. Our 2014 United Way campaign was the most successful in the company's history, with teammates donating nearly $6.5 million. And for our shareholders, we delivered strong efficiency performance and a significant improvement in asset quality. The result of which was 18% earnings growth and a 10-basis-point improvement in ROA. In addition, we more than doubled our capital return. 
Separately, we were able to resolve several outstanding legacy mortgage matters, and this quarter's legal provision expense is another important step in that process. 
And then finally, for all the teammates on this call, I'd like to thank them for what they've done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and our communities and in our ongoing drive to delivering improved performance for our shareholders. So teammates, thank you. And Ankur, let me turn that back over to you."

What -- you've obviously seen continued progress in the investment banking part of our business, and we've added more capability there, but we've also expanded that reach within our company. So we've seen, now, a much more expanded fee-generating capability out of our commercial business and out of our commercial real estate business. The investments we've made in corporate banking sort [ph] of around the country, you're starting to now see some of the fee generation that comes from that. So there are a lot of momentum builders in that business. Everything on the Private Wealth side has continued to have momentum. We're up about 6% there. We've continued to invest in people.

I'd love to extrapolate the next 2 days across the rest of the year. I'm not sure we can do that. But we are starting to see some activity, not only in the refinance side, but just sort of the core basic business in our retail markets as our markets improve. So there are a number of things. I mean, those are sort of just 3, but there are a number of things that we're investing in. Credit card will be another on the smaller side in terms of fee generation."

It's about 3.5% of the portfolio and about 70% of that portfolio is really not significantly related to falling oil prices. I think about 50% of portfolio is utility. So that's sort of separate, a large part is midstream, that's just the transporting of oil from one place to another, that's not as impacted by prices. So much lower exposure in the E&P side and the oilfield services side. From a capital markets perspective and really also a loan growth perspective, I mean, energy has been an important part of what we do. We don't want to undermine that. But it's been sort of less than 10% of our loan growth. And the fee part of the business has been pretty consistent over the last several years, so this is not something that's been disproportionately part of the fee income business. Did some of the fee business in the fourth quarter that was energy-related not happen, yes, that would be accurate. And a high yield markets sort of tightened up. Will some of that happen this year? Maybe. I think, actually, we're pretty well positioned. You'll remember, we made a small acquisition of a company called Lantana, which is in the advice business. And while I don't -- I think once sort of things level out a little bit, probably, sort of to the latter part of this year, I think you're going to see a lot of activity actually in the energy side as people sort of reset and think about their structure. As it relates to the consumer side, I mean, I think you sort of hit it accurately. I mean, relative to -- given the fact that we're not in a lot of the geographic markets that are going to be impacted more by falling oil prices, we'll -- our consumers will see sort of that increase in -- a tax refund equivalent of falling oil prices. Have we seen it yet? I mean, it might be too early. I mean, I've looked closely at spending numbers and at credit card numbers and those kind of things. So while they're marginally up, it might be a little bit early to sort of see the total impact of that. But I have to believe that, over the course of the year, we'll see the most positive side for us arching much more towards the consumer side than the risk on the energy side."

And as the rate drops, the mortgage-backed securities we have in our investment portfolio tend to prepay a little bit faster and we reinvest that cash at slightly lower rates. So with a dramatic drop in rates such as we've seen, we'll get probably a little bit more public awareness, a little bit more publicity, and some of that will happen a little bit faster. The offset to that from a NIM and net interest income perspective, of course, is increased refis and increased fee income in the Mortgage business that I am hoping will act to completely offset the drop in net interest income from lower rates."

I mean, there are some markets that -- we do a lot of work in some markets where the absorption balance is just right. Globally, it's still okay, but there are pockets where we've gone from green to yellow in our map, and we're probably pulling back in a couple of places in multifamily.

I'll begin this morning with a high-level overview of the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Aleem to discuss the results in more detail. Following  Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the segment level and wrap up with my perspectives on 2014 as a whole. 
Throughout the year, we've made significant progress on several fronts. Continued expense discipline and further improvement in credit quality helped to offset the impact of the sustained low rate environment on revenues and translated into core earnings growth and lower adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter continued that momentum. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72 on net income of common of $378 million. This quarter's results included $145 million legal provision to both resolved and reserved for legacy mortgage matters. We remain focused on resolving these matters in a prudent fashion, and this quarter's accrual was another step in the right direction. 
Excluding the legal provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, up 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Total revenue was up modestly relative to the prior quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat, as it has been in prior quarters, with solid loan and deposit growth offset by continued margin compression. Noninterest income was up 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher mortgage-related income and good performance in investment banking. Adjusted expenses were generally stable to the prior quarter, however, down a full 7% compared to the prior year, driven by continued expense reduction efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. Importantly, for the full year, we reduced our expense base from 2013, as adjusted expenses were down nearly $200 million or 4% year-over-year. 
Accordingly, we met our efficiency ratio goal with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year, well below the target we set at the beginning of the year. Given our out-performance in 2014 and the real revenue headwinds we face in 2015, further progress in the short term becomes much more challenging. However, we are committed to delivering further efficiency improvement this year, albeit modest, to stay on track to achieve our primary long-term goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were up 2% on a sequential basis and 6% year-over-year, with continued momentum in C&I, commercial real estate and Consumer. Deposit growth improved this quarter, up 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the prior year. A portion of this growth is seasonal and temporary in nature, but our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by better execution and enhanced capabilities. 
Our credit quality continue to improve, with NPLs down 17% and net charge-offs declining 11 basis points compared to the third quarter, both reaching new multiyear lows. While improving economic conditions have played a role in our strong asset quality performance, this is also the result of significant actions we've taken over the past several years to both derisk and diversify our balance sheet and improve the quality of our production. 
Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter, with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the financials."

Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items, the det",2145,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. 
Before I begin my review of this quarter, I'll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain noncore items, the details of which are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation and release. These items can skew both quarterly and annual comparisons and, therefore, I will primarily focus on adjusted results to make the core trends more clear. 
Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.72, including $145 million legal provision related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters, which reflects increased legal reserves and the final settlement of a specific matter. This legal accrual was recorded as we made further progress on certain matters in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, based on what we know today, we would expect our reasonably possible legal losses in excess of reserves to decline by a roughly similar amount. 
Excluding the impact of this provision, adjusted earnings per share were $0.88, which were 9% higher than the prior quarter and 14% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher noninterest income, a lower provision for credit losses and a slightly lower effective tax rate. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, earnings growth was driven by a 7% reduction in adjusted expenses, higher mortgage-related revenue and a lower provision expense which, together, more than offset the loss of income from RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 18% compared to 2013, as solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and improved asset quality more than offset a reduction in mortgage production income and a 17-basis-point decline in the net interest margin. 
Let's review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. 
Net interest income was stable relative to the prior quarter, as solid loan growth offset the effect of margin compression. 
Net interest margin declined 7 basis points due to the decline in commercial loan swap income and lower securities yields, which resulted from higher premium amortization as MBS cash flows increased. 
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. However, we expect further compression in this asset class given the competitive landscape and low interest rate environment. As we have said before, loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower. However, the C&I business often brings with it additional noninterest income and deposit revenue opportunities. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients' needs and, therefore, maintain a disciplined focus on overall returns. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was also stable, as 8% average earning asset growth offset the 24 basis points of margin compression. 
Looking at the full year, net interest margin declined more than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, as Wholesale Banking loan growth was stronger than expected and yields continued to compress. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly in 2014, with 10-year rates declining 80 to 90 basis points from already low levels. 
Looking forward, we expect first quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 7 to 9 basis points from the current level, driven primarily by lower commercial loan swap income. 
In addition, all things being equal, net interest income will decline by approximately $50 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter given lower commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days coming up. 
We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher investment banking and mortgage-related income. 
Investment banking income increased $21 million due to higher syndicated finance and M&A revenues. Mortgage production income increased $16 million on improved gain-on-sale margins and higher refinance activity, both as a result of lower rates in the quarter. 
Mortgage servicing income increased $8 million sequentially as the result of a larger servicing portfolio and higher seasonal payment activity in the fourth quarter. 
Trust and investment management income was down $9 million compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by certain seasonal and nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. In addition, service charges for deposits declined $7 million, again, largely driven by seasonal trends. 
Lastly, we incurred $5 million of net securities losses in the quarter resulting from a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income decreased $15 million due to the loss of RidgeWorth fee income, partially offset by an increase in mortgage-related revenue. 
Finally, full year noninterest income, excluding the gain-on-sale of RidgeWorth and its associated revenues, was up 4% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we're creating in our CIB business as well as retail investment services, Private Wealth and credit card. 
Moving to Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of the legal provision, was stable to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $60 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2014, consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. 
Outside processing and software costs increased $22 million due to higher utilization of third-party services, in addition to normal quarterly variability. 
Other noninterest expense increased $26 million, due primarily to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted cyclical costs were stable to the prior quarter and down $32 million relative to the prior year. 
Going forward, we do not anticipate these costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base, with the exception of occasional variability in operating losses. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 7%, driven by a combination of our efficiency efforts, lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. 
For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 4% compared to 2013 and a full 14% compared to 2011. 
As we look to the first quarter, we currently anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses and also will return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefits costs. 
Bigger picture, on an annual basis, we do not expect core expenses to decline from the 2014 level given our revenue goals. However, our main focus is on the efficiency ratio and, thus, we will calibrate our expense base against the revenue environment. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.4% from 61.9% in the prior quarter, as we delivered both modest revenue growth and a slight decline in adjusted expenses. 
Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 63%, 230 basis points lower than 2013, despite the significant headwinds from lower mortgage volumes and declining net interest margin. 
For 2015, our goal is to slightly improve upon last year's 63% adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. 
As Bill noted earlier, progress in '15 will be significantly more difficult than '14 for a few reasons. First, we're expecting commercial loan swap income to decline by $185 million, which represents 150-basis-point headwind to our efficiency ratio. Second, as discussed on the previous slide, our core expenses have declined significantly over the past few years and we do not anticipate further declines. And lastly, having achieved a better-than-projected result in 2014, we are now starting from a lower base than previously expected. 
Irrespective of the short-term trajectory, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9. Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined another 17% sequentially, in small part, due to a transfer of $38 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale status, but largely due to outflows that continued to exceed inflows. This significant reduction in the nonperforming loan portfolio was achieved in conjunction with the net charge-off ratio declining 11 basis points, reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio, alongside modestly higher recoveries in the fourth quarter. 
Our allowance for credit losses declined $20 million sequentially, as the continued improvement in overall asset quality more than offset a reserve build in the Wholesale Banking segment to address uncertainty in the energy sector. While our energy and utilities clients are important to our overall CIB business, they represent only 3.5% of our loan portfolio, with 70% of the book in the utilities and power, midstream and downstream sectors, which are not as meaningfully impacted by commodity price volatility. 
Total provision expense decreased $19 million sequentially due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by the lower reserve release. 
Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are unlikely to sustain themselves at these levels over the long term, so we're not expecting a significant increase in 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect our loan loss provision expense in 2015 to be fairly stable to 2014. However, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in our loan portfolio, combined with a view on future economic conditions. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. Average performing loan growth was up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, partially offset by continued declines in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. 
C&I loan growth was broad-based and driven by both our Corporate and Commercial Banking clients. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in both our institutional and regional businesses. Consumer loans were also higher due to growth in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect portfolios. 
During the quarter, we sold $800 million of loans and transferred another $1.1 billion of loans to held for sale status. The net gain or loss on the sales and transfers was immaterial. Collectively, these transactions were part of our strategy to optimize our balance sheet and improve returns. And going forward, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate loan sales to further the strategy. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8 billion or 6%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. End-of-period loans increased at a lower rate of $5.6 billion or 4% compared to the prior year, as we conducted approximately $4 billion of loan sales in the second half of 2014. 
Our solid loan production performance reflects our execution of targeted growth initiatives, alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets. 
Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year, driven by improved and broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. While a portion of this growth is seasonal and will decline in the first quarter, the majority of the growth is core and reflects both: investments we have made in client-facing platforms, such as SummitView and our Treasury & Payments Solutions offerings; and our overall increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposits needs. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 4 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.7% due to balance sheet growth. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings. 
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as part of a longer-term process to optimize the mix between common and noncommon Tier 1 capital. We also repurchased $110 million of common stock. The cumulative actions we've taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels, should help us to further increase capital returns to shareholders. 
We submitted our 2015 capital plan earlier this month and we'll have more to report on this matter in March. 
Lastly, as of year-end, our liquidity coverage ratio continues to exceed the January 1, 2016 90% requirement. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."

In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on our core initiatives -- core growth initiatives, while holding the line on expenses. Looking at the num",1209,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll draw your attention to Slide 13. 
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on our core initiatives -- core growth initiatives, while holding the line on expenses. 
Looking at the numbers. Net income declined 5% sequentially, but was up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven primarily by higher provision expense due to some moderating asset quality improvement. 
Total revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but was up 3% year-over-year. Net interest income increased relative to both prior periods, driven by continued growth in loans and deposits. Noninterest income was down sequentially due to seasonally higher income and certain nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. Year-over-year, noninterest income was up 3%, driven by growth in Wealth Management-related income and card fees. 
Average loans were up by 0.5 percentage point on a sequential basis, with double-digit growth in consumer direct, partially offset by a continued run-off in the home equity portfolio and certain loan sales during the quarter. 
Average deposits grew 3% sequentially, reflecting our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit needs, particularly in our affluent and high net worth businesses. 
Turning to the full year results. Net income was up 7%, driven by higher revenue and lower provision, partially offset by higher expenses. Total revenue increased 2%, driven primarily by a 6% growth in Wealth Management-related fees, which reflects our increased investment in people, tools, technology to better meet our client needs. These investments were the primary drivers of growth and expenses year-over-year. The full year results in this business demonstrate good execution of the core strategic initiatives we've outlined in the past, improving Wealth Management-related income, enhancing the growth on returns of our Consumer Lending portfolio and making critical investments in talent and technology. Heading into 2015, we want to continue our core revenue momentum. However, expense discipline will also remain important, as we continue to balance cost-reduction opportunities with selective investments for growth. 
Turning to Slide 14 in our Wholesale business. Wholesale Banking remains a key growth engine for the company, and we continued that momentum in the business for the fourth quarter. While net income declined due to an increased provision expense, revenue increased compared to the prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up 5% sequentially and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth. Adjusted noninterest income declined 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year due to lower trading income and structured finance-related fees. These trends were partially offset by higher investment banking revenue and particularly good performance given the market volatility in the fourth quarter. 
Average loan balances were up 5% when compared to the prior quarter, with growth across the entire platform. We had growth in almost all of our CIB verticals, in addition to the momentum in core commercial real estate, national corporate banking and our specialty commercial groups, in particular, auto dealer, and not-for-profit and government. 
Loan yields remained under pressure, constraining our margin. However, as we've said before, our risk-adjusted return hurdles incorporate the entire client relationship, which also includes deposits and fee income generation. For the full year, client deposits increased 10% and capital markets-related fees were up 9%. 
Looking at our full year results. Adjusted net income increased 10%, driven by solid revenue growth and lower provision. Fees were up modestly, as lower trading and leasing income, combined with the exit of a legacy affordable housing partnership, were more than offset by a 13% growth in investment banking income. 
Our full year investment banking performance reflects broad-based growth with record or near-record results across debt and equity capital markets and M&A. The success of our platform reflects our continued investment in talent to both expand and diversify our capabilities. 
This year, we've been able to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capability to not only our larger corporate client base, but also our core Commercial Banking and commercial real estate clients, and that's a value proposition that's increasingly well received. 
Looking forward, our pipelines remain healthy, and I'm confident that the Wholesale organization has the momentum to drive further growth in 2015. 
Shifting to Mortgage. Adjusted net income in the mortgage segment increased $38 million on a sequential basis, driven by growth in fee income and lower provision. In particular, production-related income was up $16 million due to higher volume and gain-on-sale margins as a result of lower interest rates. 
Servicing-related income was up $9 million due to the recent servicing acquisitions and a seasonal increase in payments. Adjusted expenses were up 12% sequentially due, in part, to the increased client activity in the quarter. 
For the full year, Mortgage delivered core profitability, driven by a 35% reduction in core expenses. Revenue declined modestly, as growth in net interest income was more than offset by a decline in fee income. Core mortgage production income declined 47% [ph] year-over-year. However, mortgage servicing income more than doubled, driven mainly by lower prepayments in the servicing portfolio in 2014. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined from triple digits in 2013 to 74% in 2014. 
Over the past year, our core Mortgage business demonstrated significant improvement. This progress was driven by a lot of heavy lifting to normalize our cost base and improve our risk profile. Most of that is now complete, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to more firmly focus on the core strategies in place to meet more client needs, drive higher revenue and deliver incremental efficiency improvement. 
But before we begin the Q&A part of the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our accomplishments during the year. 
So coming into 2014, we faced several meaningful revenue headwinds, namely, the end of the mortgage refi boom and the ongoing impact of prolonged low rate environment on net interest margin. However, we remain focused on the commitments we've made to our stakeholders and we delivered on those goals. For our clients, we increased investments in people and enhanced capabilities to better anticipate and serve their needs. For our team mates, we invested more in training and opportunities to improve their own financial well-being. For our local communities, we continued to support economic growth through purposeful investments, active partnerships and volunteer commitment. Our 2014 United Way campaign was the most successful in the company's history, with teammates donating nearly $6.5 million. And for our shareholders, we delivered strong efficiency performance and a significant improvement in asset quality. The result of which was 18% earnings growth and a 10-basis-point improvement in ROA. In addition, we more than doubled our capital return. 
Separately, we were able to resolve several outstanding legacy mortgage matters, and this quarter's legal provision expense is another important step in that process. 
And then finally, for all the teammates on this call, I'd like to thank them for what they've done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and our communities and in our ongoing drive to delivering improved performance for our shareholders. So teammates, thank you. And Ankur, let me turn that back over to you."

What -- you've obviously seen continued progress in the investment banking part of our business, and we've added more capability there, but we've also expanded that reach within our company. So we've seen, now, a much more expanded fee-generating capability out of our commercial business and out of our commercial real estate business. The investments we've made in corporate banking sort [ph] of around the country, you're starting to now see some of the fee generation that comes from that. So there are a lot of momentum builders in that business. Everything on the Private Wealth side has continued to have momentum. We're up about 6% there. We've continued to invest in people. We've continued to invest in technology. We're sort of net in a hiring mode in that business. But we've also done things like put premier bankers in our branches. And they're going to really help -- we've given them a lot more data and a lot more analytics, and they're really going to help us mine what we have as an already sort of bias to the affluent in our retail system, and we're going to mine that better. And then Mortgage. Isn't it great to mention Mortgage on the positive side? We're going to see some movement there. We've already seen, here in the first couple of days, some refi activity. I'd love to extrapolate the next 2 days across the rest of the year. I'm not sure we can do that. But we are starting to see some activity, not only in the refinance side, but just sort of the core basic business in our retail markets as our markets improve. So there are a number of things. I mean, those are sort of just 3, but there are a number of things that we're investing in. Credit card will be another on the smaller side in terms of fee generation."

It's about 3.5% of the portfolio and about 70% of that portfolio is really not significantly related to falling oil prices. I think about 50% of portfolio is utility. So that's sort of separate, a large part is midstream, that's just the transporting of oil from one place to another, that's not as impacted by prices. So much lower exposure in the E&P side and the oilfield services side. From a capital markets perspective and really also a loan growth perspective, I mean, energy has been an important part of what we do. We don't want to undermine that. But it's been sort of less than 10% of our loan growth. And the fee part of the business has been pretty consistent over the last several years, so this is not something that's been disproportionately part of the fee income business. Did some of the fee business in the fourth quarter that was energy-related not happen, yes, that would be accurate. And a high yield markets sort of tightened up. Will some of that happen this year? Maybe. I think, actually, we're pretty well positioned. You'll remember, we made a small acquisition of a company called Lantana, which is in the advice business. And while I don't -- I think once sort of things level out a little bit, probably, sort of to the latter part of this year, I think you're going to see a lot of activity actually in the energy side as people sort of reset and think about their structure. As it relates to the consumer side, I mean, I think you sort of hit it accurately. I mean, relative to -- given the fact that we're not in a lot of the geographic markets that are going to be impacted more by falling oil prices, we'll -- our consumers will see sort of that increase in -- a tax refund equivalent of falling oil prices. Have we seen it yet? I mean, it might be too early. I mean, I've looked closely at spending numbers and at credit card numbers and those kind of things. So while they're marginally up, it might be a little bit early to sort of see the total impact of that. But I have to believe that, over the course of the year, we'll see the most positive side for us arching much more towards the consumer side than the risk on the energy side."

If there are large moves one way or the other, we'll consider that in our overall balance sheet strategy. In this -- in the fourth quarter, we had some small actions. In addition, you saw the securities laws, that was basically moving Level 2 HQLA into Level 1 to make sure that we continue to stay compliant under the LCR.

And those are split, some fixed, some floating or some fixed, some aren't. And the other place that the 10-year rate affects us is in the investment portfolio. And as the rate drops, the mortgage-backed securities we have in our investment portfolio tend to prepay a little bit faster and we reinvest that cash at slightly lower rates. So with a dramatic drop in rates such as we've seen, we'll get probably a little bit more public awareness, a little bit more publicity, and some of that will happen a little bit faster. The offset to that from a NIM and net interest income perspective, of course, is increased refis and increased fee income in the Mortgage business that I am hoping will act to completely offset the drop in net interest income from lower rates."

I mean, there are some markets that -- we do a lot of work in some markets where the absorption balance is just right. Globally, it's still okay, but there are pockets where we've gone from green to yellow in our map, and we're probably pulling back in a couple of places in multifamily.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem'a comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level and then of course, we will take some Q&A.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.78 on net income to common of $411 million, that was up 7% per share relative to a year ago. Overall, this quarter results were solid, with good performance in certain areas, including continued expense discipline, higher mortgage and capital markets-related income, strong credit quality and further deposit growth momentum.  These favorable chance helped us to counteract the decline and net interest margin over the past year. 
Total revenue declined compared to both prior quarter and prior year, entirely due to the lower net interest income, much of which was anticipated as the prolonged low-interest rate environment continues to pressure asset yields.  Partially offsetting this was an improvement in noninterest income, driven by an increase in mortgage and capital markets related revenue. 
Current quarter expenses were relatively stable to the adjusted level in the fourth quarter, as seasonally higher personnel costs were offset by reductions in most other operating expense categories, though portion of these declines were seasonal or nonrecurring in nature. More importantly, expenses were down to 3% from the prior year adjusted level as a result of continued expense management efforts, lower operating costs, a lower operating losses and the sale of RidgeWorth.  The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjustable tangible efficiency ratio of 64.4% for the current quarter, slightly below the first quarter of last year. 
As we noted in January, year-over-year improvements in 2015 will be less than last year as we continue to work towards our goal of being sub-63 for the full year.
Average performing loans were stable sequentially, due in part to low sale activity quarter and elevated paydown activity in the current quarter, but also due to our strategic focus on overall returns. While we remain confident in our loan production capacity and the improvement economic conditions in our markets and businesses, our focus on returns will remain high and may impact ultimate on balance sheet loan growth.
Average client deposits were up 3% compared to the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across consumer, private wealth and wholesale businesses. Our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities.
Asset quality continues to be an area of strength. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from prior quarter and 34% from prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points relatively stable to the prior quarter and year. 
Our capital position improved with the our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on the Basel III fully phased-in basis. Also, tangible book value per share continues to steadily increase, up 2% sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year.
Lastly, our capital, the capital plan that we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process received no objection by the Federal Reserve. Our common stock dividend will increase 20% subject to board approval, and we will repurchase $875 million worth of common stock over the coming 5 quarters, which is 55% higher than our previous share buyback authorization.
We're pleased that our strong capital position improved earnings power and reduced risk profile enabled this positive outcome for our shareholders.
So to recap the year-over-year trends. Net interest income declined, most of which was related to the anticipated step down in the commercial loans swap income. Noninterest income trends were solid and they more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenues. And lastly, expenses continue to be well-managed and asset quality is strong, both of which played an important role in mitigating the pressure on the margin and thus keeping us on an overall positive trajectory.
So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Aleem for a for some more details."

Good morning, everybody, thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, and $0.05 or 7% hig",1789,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody, thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, and $0.05 or 7% higher than the first quarter of last year.
The sequential decline was driven by a lower net interest income and seasonally higher compensation expenses and was partially offset by higher mortgage-related income and lower provision expense.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by the continued expense discipline, a lower provision expense and higher mortgage and capital markets related revenue, which together, more than offset the decline in interest income and the return to a more normal tax rate. In addition, certain discrete recoveries, which I will discuss later, also contributed to the solid year-over-year EPS growth.
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined $73 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days, but also impacted by higher premium amortization expense and the securities portfolio. 
Net interest margin declined 13 basis points, primarily due to lower swap income and the higher premium amortization expense, but also due to continued core margin pressure as a result of the low interest rate and competitive environment.
Relative to the guidance we provided in January, the higher premium amortization expense negatively impacted NIM more than we had anticipated as 10-year rates declined another 30 basis points sequentially. Conversely, mortgage-related revenues benefited from the decline in rates, which I will discuss later.
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, declined 7 basis points, as new production yields continued to be lower than portfolio yields. We remain focused on ensuring that we both meet the full suite of our wholesale clients' needs and also, our own return requirements. When we cannot achieve this, we will look to either exit the lending relationship via targeted loan sales as we have done in the past couple of quarters, or simply not participate during future renewal opportunities.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $64 million, primarily driven by the same factors as the sequential drivers, but partially mitigated by 7% average earning asset growth. 
Looking forward, and all else equal, we expect second quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 2 [ph] to 4 [ph] basis points from the first quarter level, driven primarily by lower C&I loan yields.
We have been and we'll continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low-interest rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risks in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased to $9 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage production and trading income, which offset seasonal declines in other noninterest income categories. 
Mortgage production income increased $22 million due to higher production volume as a result of elevated refinance activity and improved gain-on-sale margins. On the other hand, mortgage servicing income declined $10 million as in the K expense increased given the first quarter decline in market rates.
Investment banking income declined $12 million sequentially, largely due to typical patterns of client activity between the fourth and first quarter. However, the $97 million of investment banking income this quarter is a record for a first quarter, with particular strength in investment-grade debt and equity capital markets businesses.
Trading income increased $15 million as the result of both higher client activity levels and the negative valuation adjustments in the prior quarter.
Service charges for deposits and card fees were collectively down $13 million due both to fewer days in the quarter and reduced incidence rates. Other noninterest income was higher, almost entirely due to an $18 million pretax gain recognized upon the sale of legacy Affordable Housing properties. As you'll recall, we recognized an impairment last year when we made the decision to exit these properties. Market values are now higher, and those sales are now largely complete.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income increased to $12 million, as higher production income and capital markets related revenue more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth income.
Moving on to expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $16 million relative to the prior quarter. Personnel expense increased $100 million sequentially as a result of typical first quarter FICA and 401(k) costs, as well as the return to more normal levels of incentives and benefit accruals. 
Outside processing and software costs declined $17 million, as the fourth quarter had elevated expenses, mostly due to normal timing patterns of rendering service and costs associated with replacing specific software.
Marketing and customer development expense also declined $16 million due to typical seasonality. Other noninterest expense declined $35 million due to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter, alongside $17 million of discrete recoveries realized in the first quarter. Operating losses declined $15 million on an adjusted basis, in part due to the recoveries of previously recorded mortgage-related losses.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 3%, driven by a combination of the sale of RidgeWorth, discrete recoveries in the current quarter and our continued overall discipline around expense management.
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 64.4% in the first quarter, 50 basis points better than last year. We delivered this improvement despite the expected $50 million step-down in commercial loan swap income, as adjusted expenses were lower by 3%. 
As we have noted before, improvement in 2015 will be more challenging given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year.  However, our performance this quarter demonstrates solid progress towards our goal. 
We continue to remain focused on the efficiency ratio and our goal of being below 63% for the full year. And as such, we will continue to exhibit strong expense discipline in light of the current revenue environment.
Turning to Slide 9. Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 3% sequentially and are down 34% compared to the prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points in the first quarter, stable with previous quarterly levels, as charge-offs continue to stay low. However, recoveries were lower than the run rate experienced in 2014.
With respect to our energy portfolio, we have not seen any meaningful delinquencies or defaults. During the quarter, we updated credit ratings, resulting in some migration and we expect that to be ongoing, which is why we have proactively built reserves for this portfolio. 
Our allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $44 million and $19 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality, combined with the lower loan growth during the quarter.
Over the near-term, we expect further, though moderating declines in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are likely to remain within the 30 to 40 basis points range in the near term, though any given quarter, may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today's low overall net charge-off rates.
We now expect full year 2015 provision expense to be below full year 2014 expense, as asset quality continues to improve, which is modestly better than our previous guidance. As you know, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in our loan portfolio, combined with a view on future economic conditions.
Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were stable relative to last quarter as a result of loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay-downs in the first quarter, in addition to lower production as a result of our continued focus on returns. 
C&I loan growth, while somewhat slower, was positive and broad-based, driven by our corporate, commercial and small business clients. Consumer Direct loans were also nicely higher, given continued growth in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership.
As you'll recall, we sold $2 billion of loans in the prior quarter which impacted sequential average loan growth -- sequential average growth rates. In addition, we moved approximately $400 million of loans to held-for-sale in the current quarter, which modestly impacted end of period growth.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $5.1 billion or 4%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios outside of the residential, guaranteed student and indirect auto portfolios where the declines are consistent with our balance sheet optimization goals of better diversification and higher returns.
Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. We will also continue to keep the high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.
Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up $3.6 billion or 3% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here effects our overall focus on meeting our clients deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in client-facing platforms and people across both our consumer and private wealth and wholesale segment.  Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior year.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated on now fully phased-in basis increased to 9.8%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings.
As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2015 CCAR process. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $875 million over the coming 5 quarters, which will be conducted relatively evenly on a quarterly basis, in addition to a 20% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.20 to $0.24, subject to board approval.
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement of 90%. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."
305901,288600727,790391,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. In our consumer and Private Wealth Management, segment revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year due predominantly to higher net interest income, average loans have been relatively flat. However, we've",1137,"Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. In our consumer and Private Wealth Management, segment revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year due predominantly to higher net interest income, average loans have been relatively flat. However, we've had solid growth in our higher return portfolios such as Consumer Direct and credit card, which is offset the intentional reductions we've made in the indirect auto and guaranteed student portfolios.
This shifted portfolio mix is consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company.  Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was 7% year-over-year deposit growth. Our improvements in deposit growth can be attributed to a more relentless focus supplemented by additional teammate investment, particularly in our mass to fluent high net worth segment and better technology, with our SummitView platform being one of the notable examples.
Noninterest income declined 6% compared to the prior quarter, largely due to seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, noninterest income was essentially flat. While retail investment income growth diminished a bit, the quality of this income line is improving as the higher percentage is related to client assets under management versus more transaction-based revenue.
Growing Wealth Management-related income overall continues to be our strategic priority. Expenses were up 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to increased outside processing costs and certain discrete nonrecurring charges. Staff expenses remained relatively flat as ongoing efficiency savings offset continued investments associated with the revenue growth initiatives.
Lastly, despite solid 4% year-over-year growth in pre-provision net revenue, net income was down 3% as provision expense increased due to moderating asset quality improvements. However, overall asset quality continues to be very strong in this segment. 
So to recap, this is a difficult operating environment for this business as you know, but we are generating good core momentum for the long term. In the near-term, continued expense discipline will be important to help combat the revenue pressures that are associated with low interest rates and consumer service charges.
Turning to wholesale. Wholesale Banking continues to be a key growth engine for the company. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 18% year-over-year driven by solid revenue growth and further asset quality improvement. Adjusted revenue grew 8% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up 9%, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth, though this was partially offset by a decline in loan spreads.  Loan growth was 2% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across most of our client segments.  
However, given the competitive environment sent continued low-rate environment, C&A production yields continue to be pressured and as such, we reduced growth or sold loans in areas that are not meeting our long-term return hurdles. 
Deposits were up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, and the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our Treasury and payment product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist hires, both allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients deposit needs.
Adjusted noninterest income was up 6% over the prior year driven by higher investment banking and trading revenue, reflecting the investments we've made in talent and capabilities to increase our market share. While syndications and leveraged finance volumes were down year-over-year, investment-grade debt and equity capital markets at record quarters and overall, as of Aleem mentioned, this was our best first quarter for investment banking income.
This overall performance is a testament to the enhanced diversity of our platform, both our product and industry, and as a result of the continuous investments we've made hin the business. Going forward, wer focused on leveraging the investments for the central swap to better meet the capital markets and advisory needs of our commercial banking, CRE and private wealth clients.
Adjusted noninterest expense was higher year-over-year, largely due to the investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio which is very accretive to the overall company. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and our value proposition continues to be very well received by clients.
Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we're working hard to mitigate that impact by being more selective by utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continue to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities.
Looking forward, our clients remain confident, our investment banking backlog and loan and deposit pipelines are healthy and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for this segment.
Now moving to the mortgage segment where we had another good quarter. Adjusted net income was stable to the prior quarter, but up $42 million over the prior year. Our expense base continues to decline, while our risk profile was improving, both of which are key components of our strategy in this business. In addition, a strong refinance environment boosted production income in the first quarter.
Getting into the details, revenues were up 8% year-over-year driven primarily by higher mortgage production income as a result of a 64% increase in production volume and a higher gain-on-sale margins. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were basically flat as higher production income was offset by higher decay in the servicing portfolio and lower spreads on the loan portfolio, a reflection of the natural hedge within the business.
While mortgage production volume was up 8% sequentially, application volume was up 48%, which should support elevated levels of production income into the near-term. 
The current refinance environment will abate when rates begin to rise, however, we expect purchase volume and our operating markets will continue to strengthen given overall economic conditions. Our expectation is supported by a purchase volume and applications being up 16% and 30%, respectively, year-over-year.
Adjusted expenses were down 5% sequentially and year-over-year despite higher revenue, primarily due to declines in operating losses and other cyclical costs. Additionally, asset quality continues to improve with delinquencies nonperformers, net charge-offs continuing on a declining trend.
So to summarize the quarter for the overall company, we had a solid momentum across each of our businesses which help mitigate the impact of the persistently low-interest rate environment on our net interest margin. Our focus on returns will remain a priority and the capacity we've built throughout the company should help us to continue and deliver a profitable growth.
In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and improve our efficiency ratio. This expense discipline will also be important to help fund continued growth investments, many of which are already yielding positive results so that we can continue to deliver long-term value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur."

John, you mentioned a few line items which are somewhat cyclical by nature and I think continuing the trends that we're on, we should overall, maybe not quarter-to-quarter, maybe seeing those continue to go down as the quality of our portfolio improves. But then as Aleem pointed out, then it's everything else in the shows the call way we run our business. I mean, lots of focus on operations cost, looking at lender centers, call centers, technology infrastructure, end-to-end focus and virtually all of our businesses, corporate real estate consolidation, use of third parties, vendor management, i mean, the list goes on. I mean, we're just highly focused on more than 2 or 3 lines as it relates to improving that expense line. But we also noted the focus is on the efficiency ratio because we're also investing. So we're sort of in the save a dollar, invest a dollar kind of mode right now because we see lots of opportunities to continue to invest in our company for long-term growth and we're going to be careful about hitting that right balance of not cutting into the sort of the core revenue capacity opportunities in our company, again, which I think, are significant long-term."

I'm not so sure that point in the future is going to be soon, i.e. in the next few months.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level and then, of course, we'll take some Q&A.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.78 on net income to common of $411 million, that was up 7% per share relative to a year ago. Overall, this quarter results were solid with good performance in certain areas, including continued expense discipline, higher mortgage and capital markets-related income, strong credit quality and further deposit growth momentum. These favorable trends helped to counteract the decline and net interest margin over the past year. 
Total revenue declined compared to both prior quarter and prior year, entirely due to the lower net interest income, much of which was anticipated as the prolonged low-interest rate environment continues to pressure asset yields. Partially offsetting this was an improvement in noninterest income, driven by an increase in mortgage and capital markets-related revenue. 
Current quarter expenses were relatively stable to the adjusted level in the fourth quarter, as seasonally higher personnel costs were offset by reductions in most other operating expense categories, though portion of these declines were seasonal or nonrecurring in nature. More importantly, expenses were down 3% from the prior year adjusted level as a result of continued expense management efforts, lower operating costs, lower operating losses and the sale of RidgeWorth.  The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjustable tangible efficiency ratio of 64.4% for the current quarter, slightly below the first quarter of last year. 
As we noted in January, year-over-year improvements in 2015 will be less than last year, as we continue to work towards our goal of being sub-63 for the full year.
Average performing loans were stable sequentially, due in part to loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated paydown activity in the current quarter, but also due to our strategic focus on overall returns. While we remain confident in our loan production capacity and the improving economic conditions in our markets and businesses, our focus on returns will remain high and may impact ultimate on balance sheet loan growth.
Average client deposits were up 3% compared to the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across consumer, private wealth and wholesale businesses. Our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities.
Asset quality continues to be an area of strength. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from prior quarter and 34% from prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points, relatively stable to the prior quarter and year. 
Our capital position improved with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on the Basel III fully phased-in basis. Also, tangible book value per share continues to steadily increase, up 2% sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year.
Lastly, our capital. The capital plan that we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process received no objection by the Federal Reserve. Our common stock dividend will increase 20% subject to board approval, and we will repurchase $875 million worth of common stock over the coming 5 quarters, which is 55% higher than our previous share buyback authorization.
We're pleased that our strong capital position improved earnings power and reduced risk profile, enabled this positive outcome for our shareholders.
So to recap year-over-year trends. Net interest income declined, most of which was related to the anticipated step-down in the commercial loan swap income. Noninterest income trends were solid and have more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenues. And lastly, expenses continue to be well managed and asset quality is strong, both of which played an important role in mitigating the pressure on the margin and, thus, keeping us on an overall positive trajectory.
So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details."
305901,288600727,790470,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis and $0.05 or 7%",1790,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis and $0.05 or 7% higher from the first quarter of last year.
The sequential decline was driven by a lower net interest income and seasonally higher compensation expenses and was partially offset by higher mortgage-related income and lower provision expense.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by the continued expense discipline, a lower provision expense and higher mortgage and capital markets related revenue which, together, more than offset the decline in net interest income and the return to a more normal tax rate. In addition, certain discrete recoveries, which I will discuss later, also contributed to the solid year-over-year EPS growth.
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined $73 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days, but also impacted by higher premium amortization expense and the securities portfolio. 
Net interest margin declined 13 basis points, primarily due to lower swap income and the higher premium amortization expense, but also due to continued core margin pressure as a result of the low interest rate and competitive environment.
Relative to the guidance we provided in January, the higher premium amortization expense negatively impacted NIM more than we had anticipated as 10-year rates declined another 30 basis points sequentially. Conversely, mortgage-related revenues benefited from the decline in rates, which I will discuss later.
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, declined 7 basis points, as new production yields continued to be lower than portfolio yields. We remain focused on ensuring that we both meet the full suite of our wholesale clients' needs and also, our own return requirements. When we cannot achieve this, we will look to either exit the lending relationship via targeted loan sales, as we have done in the past couple of quarters, or simply not participate during future renewal opportunities.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $64 million, primarily driven by the same factors as the sequential drivers, but partially mitigated by 7% average earning asset growth. 
Looking forward, and all else equal, we expect second quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 2 to 4 basis points from the first quarter level, driven primarily by lower C&I loan yields.
We have been and we'll continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low-interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased to $9 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage production and trading income, which offset seasonal declines in other noninterest income categories. 
Mortgage production income increased $22 million due to higher production volume as a result of elevated refinance activity and improved gain-on-sale margins. On the other hand, mortgage servicing income declined $10 million as the K expense increased, given the first quarter decline in market rates.
Investment banking income declined $12 million sequentially, largely due to typical patterns of client activity between the fourth and first quarter. However, the $97 million of investment banking income this quarter is a record for a first quarter, with particular strength in investment-grade debt and equity capital markets businesses. Trading income increased $15 million as the result of both higher client activity levels and the negative valuation adjustments in the prior quarter.
Service charges for deposits and card fees were collectively down $13 million due both to fewer days in the quarter and reduced incidence rates. Other noninterest income was higher, almost entirely due to an $18 million pretax gain recognized upon the sale of legacy affordable housing properties. As you'll recall, we recognized an impairment last year when we made the decision to exit these properties. Market values are now higher and those sales are now largely complete.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income increased to $12 million as higher production income and capital markets-related revenue more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth income.
Moving on to expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $16 million relative to the prior quarter. Personnel expense increased $100 million sequentially as a result of typical first quarter FICA and 401(k) costs, as well as the return to more normal levels of incentives and benefit accruals. 
Outside processing and software costs declined $17 million, as the fourth quarter had elevated expenses, mostly due to normal timing patterns of rendering service and costs associated with replacing specific software. Marketing and customer development expense also declined $16 million due to typical seasonality. 
Other noninterest expense declined $35 million due to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter, alongside $17 million of discrete recoveries realized in the first quarter. Operating losses declined $15 million on an adjusted basis, in part due to recoveries of previously recorded mortgage-related losses.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 3%, driven by a combination of the sale of RidgeWorth, discrete recoveries in the current quarter and our continued overall discipline around expense management.
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 64.4% in the first quarter, 50 basis points better than last year. We delivered this improvement despite the expected $50 million step-down in commercial loan swap income, as adjusted expenses were lower by 3%. 
As we have noted before, improvement in 2015 will be more challenging, given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. However, our performance this quarter demonstrates solid progress towards our goal. We continue to remain focused on the efficiency ratio and our goal of being below 63% for the full year. And as such, we will continue to exhibit strong expense discipline in the light of the current revenue environment.
Turning to Slide 9. Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 3% sequentially and are down 34% compared to the prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points in the first quarter, stable with previous quarterly levels as charge-offs continue to stay low. However, recoveries were lower than the run rate experienced in 2014.
With respect to our energy portfolio, we have not seen any meaningful delinquencies or defaults. During the quarter, we updated credit ratings, resulting in some migration and we expect that to be ongoing, which is why we have proactively built reserves for this portfolio. 
Our allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $44 million and $19 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality combined with the lower loan growth during the quarter.
Over the near term, we expect further, though moderating declines, in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are likely to remain within the 30 to 40 basis point range in the near term, though any given quarter may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today's low overall net charge-off rates.
We now expect full year 2015 provision expense to be below full year 2014 expense as asset quality continues to improve, which is modestly better than our previous guidance. As you know, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in our loan portfolio combined with a view on future economic conditions.
Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were stable relative to last quarter as a result of loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated paydowns in the first quarter, in addition to lower production as a result of our continued focus on returns. 
C&I loan growth, while somewhat slower, was positive and broad-based, driven by our corporate, commercial and small business clients. Consumer direct loans were also nicely higher, given continued growth in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership.
As you'll recall, we sold $2 billion of loans in the prior quarter, which impacted sequential average loan growth -- sequential average growth rates. In addition, we moved approximately $400 million of loans to held for sale in the current quarter, which modestly impacted end of period growth.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $5.1 billion or 4%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios outside of the residential, guaranteed student and indirect auto portfolios where the declines are consistent with our balance sheet optimization goals of better diversification and higher returns.
Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. We will also continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.
Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up $3.6 billion or 3% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall focus on meeting our clients deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in client-facing platforms and people across both our consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior year.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated on a fully phased-in basis increased to 9.8%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings.
As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2015 CCAR process. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $875 million over the coming 5 quarters, which will be conducted relatively evenly on a quarterly basis in addition to a 20% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.20 to $0.24, subject to board approval.
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement of 90%. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."
305901,288600727,790470,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. In our Consumer and Private Wealth Management, segment revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year due predominantly to higher net interest income. Average loans have been relatively flat. However, we've",1136,"Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. In our Consumer and Private Wealth Management, segment revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year due predominantly to higher net interest income. Average loans have been relatively flat. However, we've had solid growth in our higher return portfolios such as Consumer Direct and credit card, which has offset the intentional reductions we've made in the indirect auto and guaranteed student portfolios.
This shifted portfolio mix is consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company. Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was 7% year-over-year deposit growth. Our improvements in deposit growth can be attributed to a more relentless focus supplemented by additional teammate investment, particularly in our mass of fluent high net worth segment and better technology, with our SummitView platform being one of the notable examples.
Noninterest income declined 6% compared to the prior quarter, largely due to seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, noninterest income was essentially flat. While retail investment income growth diminished a bit, the quality of this income line is improving as a higher percentage is related to client assets under management versus more transaction-based revenue.
Growing Wealth Management-related income overall continues to be a strategic priority. Expenses were up 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to increased outside processing costs and certain discrete nonrecurring charges. Staff expenses remained relatively flat as ongoing efficiency savings offset continued investments associated with the revenue growth initiatives.
Lastly, despite solid 4% year-over-year growth and pre-provision net revenue, net income was down 3% as provision expense increased due to moderating asset quality improvements. However, overall asset quality continues to be very strong in this segment. 
So to recap, this is a difficult operating environment for this business as you know, but we are generating good core momentum for the long term. In the near term, continued expense discipline will be important to help combat the revenue pressures associated with low interest rates and consumer service charges.
Turning to wholesale. Wholesale Banking continues to be a key growth engine for the company. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 18% year-over-year, driven by solid revenue growth and further asset quality improvement. Adjusted revenue grew 8% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up 9%, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth, though this was partially offset by the decline in loan spreads. Loan growth was 2% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across most of our client segments.  
However, given the competitive environments and continued low-rate environment, C&A production yields continue to be pressured and as such, we reduced growth or sold loans in areas that are not meeting our long-term return hurdles. 
Deposits were up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, and the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our Treasury and payment product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist hires, both allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients deposit needs.
Adjusted noninterest income was up 6% over the prior year driven by higher investment banking and trading revenue, reflecting the investments we've made in talent and capabilities to increase our market share. While syndications and leveraged finance volumes were down year-over-year, investment-grade debt and equity capital markets at record quarters and overall, as Aleem mentioned, this was our best first quarter for investment banking income.
This overall performance is a testament to the enhanced diversity of our platform, both by product and industry and as a result of the continuous investments we've made in the business. Going forward, we're focused on leveraging the investments and the central swaps to better meet the capital markets and advisory needs of our commercial banking, CRE and private wealth clients.
Adjusted noninterest expense was higher year-over-year, largely due to the investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio, which is very accretive to the overall company. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and our value proposition continues to be very well received by clients.
Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we're working hard to mitigate that impact by being more selective about utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continue to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities.
Looking forward, our clients remain confident. Our investment banking backlog and loan and deposit pipelines are healthy, and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for this segment.
Now moving to the mortgage segment where we had another good quarter. Adjusted net income was stable to the prior quarter, but up $42 million over the prior year. Our expense base continues to decline, while our risk profile was improving, both of which are key components of our strategy in this business. In addition, a strong refinance environment boosted production income in the first quarter.
Getting into the details, revenues were up 8% year-over-year driven primarily by higher mortgage production income as a result of a 64% increase in production volume and higher gain-on-sale margins. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were basically flat as higher production income was offset by higher decay in the servicing portfolio and lower spreads on the loan portfolio, a reflection of the natural hedge within the business.
While mortgage production volume was up 8% sequentially, application volume was up 48%, which should support elevated levels of production income into the near term. 
The current refinance environment will abate when rates begin to rise. However, we expect purchase volume and our operating markets will continue to strengthen, given overall economic conditions. Our expectation is supported by purchase volume and applications being up 16% and 30%, respectively, year-over-year.
Adjusted expenses were down 5% sequentially and year-over-year despite higher revenue, primarily due to declines in operating losses and other cyclical costs. Additionally, asset quality continues to improve with delinquencies, nonperformers and net charge-offs continuing on a declining trend.
So to summarize the quarter for the overall company, we had a solid momentum across each of our businesses, which help mitigate the impact of the persistently low interest rate environment on our net interest margin. Our focus on returns will remain a priority, and the capacity we've built throughout the company should help us to continue and deliver a profitable growth.
In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and improve our efficiency ratio. This expense discipline will also be important to help fund continued growth investments, many of which are already yielding positive results so that we can continue to deliver long-term value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur."

So throughout your prepared remarks, you mentioned several times that you continue to want to keep your return hurdles high as you think about balance sheet growth. And you also noted that C&I loan growth may not be as strong as last year. At the same time, Wholesale Banking continues to be strong and your particular markets are also quite strong. As we think about loan growth for the balance of the year compared to last year and we mix all of those together, could you still have accelerating loan growth despite some of what you've pointed out?"

I think that's going to help us on the loan growth side. But to your question about returns, I think along with loan growth and net interest income, of course, there's fee income. And I think our strategy around being able to grow noninterest income from that client base to whom we provide the value proposition that they like, I think, is -- we've been able to demonstrate that we've been able to deliver that, and it gave a testament to the talent we brought in. And the -- our investment banking results this quarter, I think demonstrate that, that strategy is working well for us."

That's been offset a little bit this quarter, maybe uniquely by higher paydowns in the CRE side, which we discussed which, again, sort of on balance, I view as positive in terms of the confirmation of our business model and then also with the decisions that we made in the fourth quarter relative to particular loan sales. So trust me, as I said earlier, we're not putting the brakes on loan growth. I mean, we continue to be very positive about the businesses we're in. We're very positive about the markets we're in, and continue to see opportunities in that area. And much of what we're doing is meeting our hurdle requirements, and a lot of us mean our hurdle requirements because of the investments we've made on the fee-based side. The fact that we've gone -- come a long way from a spread-only business, we're able to generate a lot more income off the commitments that we make on the asset side.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level and then, of course, we'll take some Q&A.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.78 on net income to common of $411 million, that was up 7% per share relative to a year ago. Overall, this quarter results were solid with good performance in certain areas, including continued expense discipline, higher mortgage and capital markets-related income, strong credit quality and further deposit growth momentum. These favorable trends helped to counteract the decline and net interest margin over the past year. 
Total revenue declined compared to both prior quarter and prior year, entirely due to the lower net interest income, much of which was anticipated as the prolonged low-interest rate environment continues to pressure asset yields. Partially offsetting this was an improvement in noninterest income, driven by an increase in mortgage and capital markets-related revenue. 
Current quarter expenses were relatively stable to the adjusted level in the fourth quarter, as seasonally higher personnel costs were offset by reductions in most other operating expense categories, though a portion of these declines were seasonal or nonrecurring in nature. More importantly, expenses were down 3% from the prior year adjusted level as a result of continued expense management efforts, lower operating costs, lower operating losses and the sale of RidgeWorth.  The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjustable tangible efficiency ratio of 64.4% for the current quarter, slightly below the first quarter of last year. 
As we noted in January, year-over-year improvements in 2015 will be less than last year, as we continue to work towards our goal of being sub-63 for the full year.
Average performing loans were stable sequentially, due in part to loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay down activity in the current quarter, but also due to our strategic focus on overall returns. While we remain confident in our loan production capacity and the improving economic conditions in our markets and businesses, our focus on returns will remain high and may impact ultimate on balance sheet loan growth.
Average client deposits were up 3% compared to the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across consumer, private wealth and wholesale businesses. Our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities.
Asset quality continues to be an area of strength. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from prior quarter and 34% from prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points, relatively stable to the prior quarter and year. 
Our capital position improved with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on the Basel III fully phased-in basis. Also, tangible book value per share continues to steadily increase, up 2% sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year.
Lastly, our capital. The capital plan that we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process received no objection by the Federal Reserve. Our common stock dividend will increase 20% subject to board approval, and we will repurchase $875 million worth of common stock over the coming 5 quarters, which is 55% higher than our previous share buyback authorization.
We're pleased that our strong capital position improved earnings power and reduced risk profile, enabled this positive outcome for our shareholders.
So to recap year-over-year trends. Net interest income declined, most of which was related to the anticipated step-down in the commercial loan swap income. Noninterest income trends were solid and have more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenues. And lastly, expenses continue to be well managed and asset quality is strong, both of which played an important role in mitigating the pressure on the margin and, thus, keeping us on an overall positive trajectory.
So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details."
305901,288600727,790516,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis and $0.05 or 7%",1790,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis and $0.05 or 7% higher than the first quarter of last year.
The sequential decline was driven by a lower net interest income and seasonally higher compensation expenses and was partially offset by higher mortgage-related income and lower provision expense.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by the continued expense discipline, a lower provision expense and higher mortgage and capital markets related revenue which, together, more than offset the decline in net interest income and the return to a more normal tax rate. In addition, certain discrete recoveries, which I will discuss later, also contributed to the solid year-over-year EPS growth.
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined $73 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in commercial loan swap income and 2 fewer days, but also impacted by higher premium amortization expense and the securities portfolio. 
Net interest margin declined 13 basis points, primarily due to lower swap income and the higher premium amortization expense, but also due to continued core margin pressure as a result of the low interest rate and competitive environment.
Relative to the guidance we provided in January, the higher premium amortization expense negatively impacted NIM more than we had anticipated as 10-year rates declined another 30 basis points sequentially. Conversely, mortgage-related revenues benefited from the decline in rates, which I will discuss later.
Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income, declined 7 basis points, as new production yields continued to be lower than portfolio yields. We remain focused on ensuring that we both meet the full suite of our wholesale clients' needs and also, our own return requirements. When we cannot achieve this, we will look to either exit the lending relationship via targeted loan sales, as we have done in the past couple of quarters, or simply not participate during future renewal opportunities.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $64 million, primarily driven by the same factors as the sequential drivers, but partially mitigated by 7% average earning asset growth. 
Looking forward, and all else equal, we expect second quarter net interest margin to decline approximately 2 to 4 basis points from the first quarter level, driven primarily by lower C&I loan yields.
We have been and we'll continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low-interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased to $9 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage production and trading income, which offset seasonal declines in other noninterest income categories. 
Mortgage production income increased $22 million due to higher production volume as a result of elevated refinance activity and improved gain-on-sale margins. On the other hand, mortgage servicing income declined $10 million as decay expense increased, given the first quarter decline in market rates.
Investment banking income declined $12 million sequentially, largely due to typical patterns of client activity between the fourth and first quarter. However, the $97 million of investment banking income this quarter is a record for a first quarter, with particular strength in investment-grade debt and equity capital markets businesses. Trading income increased $15 million as the result of both higher client activity levels and the negative valuation adjustments in the prior quarter.
Service charges for deposits and card fees were collectively down $13 million due both to fewer days in the quarter and reduced incidence rates. Other noninterest income was higher, almost entirely due to an $18 million pretax gain recognized upon the sale of legacy affordable housing properties. As you'll recall, we recognized an impairment last year when we made the decision to exit these properties. Market values are now higher and those sales are now largely complete.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income increased to $12 million as higher production income and capital markets-related revenue more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth income.
Moving on to expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $16 million relative to the prior quarter. Personnel expense increased $100 million sequentially as a result of typical first quarter FICA and 401(k) costs, as well as the return to more normal levels of incentives and benefit accruals. 
Outside processing and software costs declined $17 million, as the fourth quarter had elevated expenses, mostly due to normal timing patterns of rendering service and costs associated with replacing specific software. Marketing and customer development expense also declined $16 million due to typical seasonality. 
Other noninterest expense declined $35 million due to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter, alongside $17 million of discrete recoveries realized in the first quarter. Operating losses declined $15 million on an adjusted basis, in part due to recoveries of previously recorded mortgage-related losses.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 3%, driven by a combination of the sale of RidgeWorth, discrete recoveries in the current quarter and our continued overall discipline around expense management.
As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 64.4% in the first quarter, 50 basis points better than last year. We delivered this improvement despite the expected $50 million step-down in commercial loan swap income, as adjusted expenses were lower by 3%. 
As we have noted before, improvement in 2015 will be more challenging, given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. However, our performance this quarter demonstrates solid progress towards our goal. We continue to remain focused on the efficiency ratio and our goal of being below 63% for the full year. And as such, we will continue to exhibit strong expense discipline in the light of the current revenue environment.
Turning to Slide 9. Our asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 3% sequentially and are down 34% compared to the prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points in the first quarter, stable with previous quarterly levels as charge-offs continue to stay low. However, recoveries were lower than the run rate experienced in 2014.
With respect to our energy portfolio, we have not seen any meaningful delinquencies or defaults. During the quarter, we updated credit ratings, resulting in some migration and we expect that to be ongoing, which is why we have proactively built reserves for this portfolio. 
Our allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $44 million and $19 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality combined with the lower loan growth during the quarter.
Over the near term, we expect further, though moderating declines, in nonperforming loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are likely to remain within the 30 to 40 basis point range in the near term, though any given quarter may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today's low overall net charge-off rates.
We now expect full year 2015 provision expense to be below full year 2014 expense as asset quality continues to improve, which is modestly better than our previous guidance. As you know, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in our loan portfolio combined with a view on future economic conditions.
Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were stable relative to last quarter as a result of loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay downs in the first quarter, in addition to lower production as a result of our continued focus on returns. 
C&I loan growth, while somewhat slower, was positive and broad-based, driven by our corporate, commercial and small business clients. Consumer direct loans were also nicely higher, given continued growth in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership.
As you'll recall, we sold $2 billion of loans in the prior quarter, which impacted sequential average loan growth -- sequential average growth rates. In addition, we moved approximately $400 million of loans to held for sale in the current quarter, which modestly impacted end of period growth.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $5.1 billion or 4%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios outside of the residential, guaranteed student and indirect auto portfolios where the declines are consistent with our balance sheet optimization goals of better diversification and higher returns.
Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. We will also continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.
Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up $3.6 billion or 3% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall focus on meeting our clients deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in client-facing platforms and people across both our consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior year.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated on a fully phased-in basis increased to 9.8%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings.
As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2015 CCAR process. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $875 million over the coming 5 quarters, which will be conducted relatively evenly on a quarterly basis in addition to a 20% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.20 to $0.24, subject to board approval.
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement of 90%. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance."
305901,288600727,790516,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. In our Consumer and Private Wealth Management, segment revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year due predominantly to higher net interest income. Average loans have been relatively flat. However, we've",1136,"Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. In our Consumer and Private Wealth Management, segment revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year due predominantly to higher net interest income. Average loans have been relatively flat. However, we've had solid growth in our higher return portfolios such as Consumer Direct and credit card, which has offset the intentional reductions we've made in the indirect auto and guaranteed student portfolios.
This shift in portfolio mix is consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company. Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was 7% year-over-year deposit growth. Our improvements in deposit growth can be attributed to a more relentless focus supplemented by additional teammate investment, particularly in our mass affluent high net worth segment and better technology, with our SummitView platform being one of the notable examples.
Noninterest income declined 6% compared to the prior quarter, largely due to seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, noninterest income was essentially flat. While retail investment income growth diminished a bit, the quality of this income line is improving as a higher percentage is related to client assets under management versus more transaction-based revenue.
Growing Wealth Management-related income overall continues to be a strategic priority. Expenses were up 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to increased outside processing costs and certain discrete nonrecurring charges. Staff expenses remained relatively flat as ongoing efficiency savings offset continued investments associated with the revenue growth initiatives.
Lastly, despite solid 4% year-over-year growth and pre-provision net revenue, net income was down 3% as provision expense increased due to moderating asset quality improvements. However, overall asset quality continues to be very strong in this segment. 
So to recap, this is a difficult operating environment for this business as you know, but we are generating good core momentum for the long term. In the near term, continued expense discipline will be important to help combat the revenue pressures associated with low interest rates and consumer service charges.
Turning to wholesale. Wholesale Banking continues to be a key growth engine for the company. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 18% year-over-year, driven by solid revenue growth and further asset quality improvement. Adjusted revenue grew 8% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up 9%, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth, though this was partially offset by the decline in loan spreads. Loan growth was 2% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across most of our client segments.  
However, given the competitive environments and continued low-rate environment, C&A production yields continue to be pressured and as such, we reduced growth or sold loans in areas that are not meeting our long-term return hurdles. 
Deposits were up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, and the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our Treasury and payment product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist hires, both allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients deposit needs.
Adjusted noninterest income was up 6% over the prior year driven by higher investment banking and trading revenue, reflecting the investments we've made in talent and capabilities to increase our market share. While syndications and leveraged finance volumes were down year-over-year, investment-grade debt and equity capital markets at record quarters and overall, as Aleem mentioned, this was our best first quarter for investment banking income.
This overall performance is a testament to the enhanced diversity of our platform, both by product and industry and as a result of the continuous investments we've made in the business. Going forward, we're focused on leveraging the investments and the central swaps to better meet the capital markets and advisory needs of our commercial banking, CRE and private wealth clients.
Adjusted noninterest expense was higher year-over-year, largely due to the investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio, which is very accretive to the overall company. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and our value proposition continues to be very well received by clients.
Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we're working hard to mitigate that impact by being more selective about utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continue to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities.
Looking forward, our clients remain confident. Our investment banking backlog and loan and deposit pipelines are healthy, and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for this segment.
Now moving to the mortgage segment where we had another good quarter. Adjusted net income was stable to the prior quarter, but up $42 million over the prior year. Our expense base continues to decline, while our risk profile was improving, both of which are key components of our strategy in this business. In addition, a strong refinance environment boosted production income in the first quarter.
Getting into the details, revenues were up 8% year-over-year driven primarily by higher mortgage production income as a result of a 64% increase in production volume and higher gain-on-sale margins. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were basically flat as higher production income was offset by higher decay in the servicing portfolio and lower spreads on the loan portfolio, a reflection of the natural hedge within the business.
While mortgage production volume was up 8% sequentially, application volume was up 48%, which should support elevated levels of production income into the near term. 
The current refinance environment will abate when rates begin to rise. However, we expect purchase volume and our operating markets will continue to strengthen, given overall economic conditions. Our expectation is supported by purchase volume and applications being up 16% and 30%, respectively, year-over-year.
Adjusted expenses were down 5% sequentially and year-over-year despite higher revenue, primarily due to declines in operating losses and other cyclical costs. Additionally, asset quality continues to improve with delinquencies, nonperformers and net charge-offs continuing on a declining trend.
So to summarize the quarter for the overall company, we had a solid momentum across each of our businesses, which help mitigate the impact of the persistently low interest rate environment on our net interest margin. Our focus on returns will remain a priority, and the capacity we've built throughout the company should help us to continue and deliver a profitable growth.
In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and improve our efficiency ratio.

If we look at areas like core commercial and our corporate banking business and I said, virtually, all of our verticals, I mean, we're seeing real growth, and we would expect that to continue. That's been offset a little bit this quarter, maybe uniquely by higher pay downs in the CRE side, which we discussed which, again, sort of on balance, I view as positive in terms of the confirmation of our business model and then also with the decisions that we made in the fourth quarter relative to particular loan sales. So trust me, as I said earlier, we're not putting the brakes on loan growth. I mean, we continue to be very positive about the businesses we're in. We're very positive about the markets we're in, and continue to see opportunities in that area. And much of what we're doing is meeting our hurdle requirements, and a lot of it's meeting our hurdle requirements because of the investments we've made on the fee-based side. The fact that we've gone -- come a long way from a spread-only business, we're able to generate a lot more income off the commitments that we make on the asset side. So I continue to feel good about the capacity to generate loan growth in this company, and I think the first quarter is just a little bit of an aberration in the sense of pay downs and then fourth quarter loan sales that are all culminating in 1 particular quarter."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89 on net income to common of $467 million, up 14% per share sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year adjusted EPS. We demonstrated good progress this quarter on key strategies and goals, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns. 
Revenue improved 4% over the previous quarter, but declined 2% for the prior year adjusted level. The sequential quarter increase can be attributed to both higher net interest income and non-interest income.
Net interest margin benefited from targeted balance sheet actions during the quarter in addition to slight improvements at core loan yields and continued growth in deposits. Average performing loans were down slightly from the prior quarter due primarily to loan sale activity driven by our continued focus on returns and pay downs of certain loan categories. We remain confident in our ability to generate targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate and our relationships are deeper, and we'll continue to closely manage areas where the competitive environment is driving down returns.
Average client deposits were up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% year-over-year with continued broad-based growth, driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. 
Adjusted noninterest income grew 7% sequentially as we deepen client relationships across the company, evidenced by growth in investment banking, retail investment income and card fees. 
Mortgage-related income declined sequentially, largely as a result of higher rates in the quarter, which drove lower refinance activity and higher hedging related costs. 
Adjusted expenses were down 2% from the prior year, driven by lower operating losses and the sale of RidgeWorth. Sequentially, adjusted expenses increased 3% as strong overall performance, higher client activity levels and typical seasonal patterns generated increases in certain variable expense categories. In addition, we continue to invest in key growth areas. 
The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63.4% for the current quarter, which improved sequentially and year-over-year. And we are continuing to work towards the very challenging goal of being sub-63 for the full year 2015.
Our asset quality performance remained strong with NPLs down 21% as we transferred a portion of the portfolio to held for sale here. The net charge-off ratio declined to 26 basis points, reaching new multiyear lows. Our asset quality performance can be attributed in part to the significant actions we've taken over the past several years to derisk and diversify and improve the quality of our production.
ROA was 103 basis points this quarter, an 11% -- or 11 basis point increased sequentially and a 3 basis point improvement relative to last year's adjusted performance. 
Return metrics are important to us, and we continue to focus on strategies to deepen client relationships and optimize the usage and mix of the balance sheet. Our capital position improved slightly with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Growth in tangible book value per share also continued, up slightly from prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year. Sequential increases in capital ratios and tangible book value occurred alongside at 36% increase in our total capital return to shareholders.
To recap, net interest margin is beginning to show signs of stabilization, partially as a result of our balance sheet management efforts as we are cautiously optimistic that we've seen the trough in net interest income. Conversely, provision expense is likely at or near the bottom, even if asset quality continues and conditions remain strong. 
Noninterest income trends are positive and reflective of our continued efforts to meet more client needs, a quarterly variability can be expected. Our focus on expense management and improving efficiency will remain high. Overall, I'm optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value for our shareholders. 
So with that as a brief overview, I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the results."
305901,303330494,834219,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year. As you",1998,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year. As you'll recall, adjustments to the second quarter of 2014 included the settlement of certain legacy mortgage matters, partially offset by the gain-on-sale of RidgeWorth. The net of which was a negative $0.09 per share impact to earnings.
The sequential quarter increase was driven by 4% revenue growth, a decline in the provision expense and a $0.03 discrete tax benefit in the current quarter. Noninterest expense did increased sequentially, but this was primarily related to business performance and activity levels, in addition to certain discrete items in the current and prior quarter, which I'll discuss later. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by improved asset quality performance, continued expense discipline and higher mortgage and capital markets-related revenue, which together more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue and lower commercial loan swap income. 
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 2% sequentially, driven by one additional day, an improvement in core loan yields and higher commercial loan swap income. The premium amortization expense related to the securities portfolio was stable sequentially, but will slightly decline next quarter due to portfolio actions we undertook during the period. 
Net interest margin improved 3 basis points, primarily due to commercial loan swap income and a slight increase in consumer and mortgage loan yields. 
Relative to the guidance we provided in April, balance sheet management actions in the quarter, including adjusting duration and repaying higher-cost wholesale funding, benefited NIM.
Core C&I loan yields were stable sequentially, a positive sign after multiple quarters of continuous declines. With that said, new production C&I yields continue to be lower than portfolio yields and thus, will likely put further pressure on the overall margin. We remain intensely focused on ensuring that we meet the full suite of our Wholesale Banking clients' needs, particularly with respect to capital markets and treasury and payments products.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $41 million, driven entirely by lower commercial loan swap income. Core margin compression due to the continued low rate environment was offset by positive loan and deposit growth. Looking forward, we expect third quarter net interest margins to be relatively stable to the second quarter level as the balance sheet management actions of the second quarter will fully be in the run rate and potentially offset core loan yield compression.
Despite the potential for stability next quarter, NIM will likely still grind down after that until interest rates begin to rise. Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to have a positive tilt toward raising rates and expect any increase in rates to be gradual and deliberately paced.
Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income increased $57 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher investment banking activity, growth in retail investment income and seasonal increases in other noninterest income categories, which offset the decline in mortgage-related income.
Investment banking had a strong quarter with revenues increasing $48 million as growth occurred across almost all product areas. Trading income was stable as lower core client-driven activity was offset by higher fair value marks on our debt. 
Mortgage production income declined $7 million due to lower lock volume and reduced gain-on-sale margins. We record gain-on-sale revenue at the time of rate lock and thus, the majority of revenues related to the refinanced activity at the prior quarter were recorded at that time. 
Mortgage servicing income declined $13 million due to higher decay expense as a result of the increased in closed loans and higher hedging costs given the increased rate volatility throughout the quarter. 
Retail investment income and card fees combined increased $12 million sequentially as we continue to deepen client relationships in the consumer-related businesses. We also recorded $14 million in net securities gains and a similar amount of debt extinguishment cost, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had no upfront P&L impact but modestly improved our forward NIM and net interest income profile. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income increased slightly as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income was able to offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $34 million sequentially due to business activity and performance in the second quarter in addition to typical seasonal trends. Personnel expense declined $15 million due mainly to the seasonal decline in benefits cost and FICO taxes, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation given improved business performance. 
Outside processing and software costs increased $15 million as a result of higher business activity levels and continued investments in technology as well as typical quarterly variability associated with the timing of rendering service. 
Marketing and customer development expense also increased $7 million as the first quarter typically has lower advertising costs. 
Other noninterest expense increased $38 million, primarily due to $14 million of debt extinguishment cost recorded in the current quarter and $17 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the prior quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 2%, driven by the sale of RidgeWorth, lower operating losses and our continued overall focus around expense management.
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 63.4% in the second quarter, down 110 basis points compared to the prior quarter and 20 basis points better than last year. We delivered year-over-year improvement, despite a $40 million decline in commercial loan swap income as we were able to grow noninterest income and reduce expenses.
As we've indicated in the prior 2 earnings calls, improvement in 2015 will be difficult given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loans swap income this year. We will need to deliver strong efficiency and PP&R performance in the second half of the year to achieve our goal of being below 63% for 2015. We are working diligently to achieve this goal but as Bill indicated earlier, it will be challenging.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9 where our performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 21% sequentially, primarily driven by the transfer of $110 million of loans to held for sale status. In addition, the net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points in the quarter, down 4 basis point from the prior quarter and 9 basis points from the prior year. The allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $59 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the even further improvement in asset quality, combined with more moderate loan growth during the second quarter. In addition, the results of the recent shared national credit exam are already reflected in our June 30 allowance. 
With respect to the energy portfolio, we have taken proactive actions in prior quarters to build reserves, and we will continue to remain vigilant given the uncertainty associated with oil and gas prices.
Asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable over the medium term given the economy environment, combined with the proactive actions we have taken to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of production. With that said, any given quarter may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today's low overall net charge-off and nonperforming ratios. Over the next couple of quarters, we expect provision expense to increase relative to the current quarter, but remain lower than similar periods in 2014 given continued improvements in asset quality. After that, improvements in asset quality will abate and economic and growth conditions will normalize. And thus, we would expect provision expense to much more closely match net charge-offs. The ultimate level of reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans declined slightly, primarily due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization we completed during the quarter. Combined with continued elevated pay downs in certain segments given the low interest rate and credit spread environments. The auto loan securitization was our inaugural transaction and its success can be attributed to the strong One Team approach we have across many units within the company. Going forward, we will periodically conduct additional securitization transactions as they allow us to more efficiently use the balance sheet and diversify our funding sources, while still being an active loan originator and partner to our auto dealership clients. 
C&I loans were relatively stable as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by targeted reductions and lower return areas. Consumer direct loans were higher given continued growth in our online businesses. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.4 billion or 2%, driven by strong 9% growth in the C&I portfolio, partially offset by reductions in residential mortgage, indirect auto and student loans, largely due to the balance sheet management and optimization activities we have executed over the past 2 quarters. 
Consumer loans were unchanged year-over-year, however, the mix has improved with growth in higher return direct segments, offset by reductions in lower return indirect segments. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and client activity levels remain healthy, and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.
Let's turn to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We're pleased with the improving momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects the overall focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments.  Our corporate liquidity specialist within Wholesale Banking, our premier bankers within retail and our SummitView products are all specific examples of investment in talent and technology that has supported this deposit growth.
Importantly, the solid growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse change in rate paid or mix. Low growth, low-cost deposit growth, continues to be strong, while higher cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the nonrate-based value proposition for clients.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings. While the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was fairly stable at 9.8%. 
Tangible book value per share increased slightly from the prior quarter as growth in retained earnings offset the lower AOCI. Importantly, tangible book value per share is up a solid 7% year-over-year. 
The second quarter also marks the beginning of our 2015 capital plan. We repurchased $175 million of common stock, up from $115 million in the prior quarter and paid the $0.24 dividend, up 20% from the previous level. Our capital return program, combined with disciplined usage of employees stock-based compensation continues to gradually drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down $4 million sequentially and $13 million year-over-year.
And lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continue to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement for 90%. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level."

In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year with the lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid",1435,"Okay, thanks, Aleem. In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year with the lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid with revenue up 4%, which when combined with stable expenses, resulted in strong operating leverage, a 220 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio and 13% year-over-year growth on pre-provision net revenue. 
Net interest income has been steadily grinding higher in this segment, both due to our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans declined sequentially due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization and also a $350 million student loan sale that was completed in April. Offsetting these reductions was solid growth and higher return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card. The loan sale activity and growth of the direct portfolios are consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company. 
Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net worth segment. Our premier bankers in the SummitView platform are examples of talent and technology that are enabling this growth. 
Noninterest income growth was solid, both sequentially and compared to a year ago. Retail investment income continues to grow, up 5% year-over-year, in large part due to increased client asset and are management in our brokerage platform as we are meeting more of our clients' Wealth Management needs.
Card fees and credit card balances are also on a positive track. Continued growth in these areas will be important, particularly given the downward pressure of traditional service charges. 
Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter and year as we maintained a disciplined approach to expense management, while investing in areas associated with revenue growth initiatives. As I stated earlier, this strategy has been paying off as we are achieving positive operating leverage in this business. 
Bigger picture, the prolonged low rate environment continues to place pressure on the value of deposits however, the balance sheet management strategies we have executed have mitigated some of these pressure. Our continued focus on meeting more client needs has generated positive momentum with regard to noninterest income and deposits, and we have further opportunity here. 
We continue to invest in our various digital platforms, and we're seeing results with steady increases in digital penetration and self-service deposits. 
The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic economies continues to perform well and are well positioned to meet -- and we are well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments.
Now moving onto Wholesale Banking, which has been the key growth engine for the company and it posted a very strong quarter with net income up 11% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Revenues grew 9% relative to the prior year and were a record, driven by broad-based growth across lines of businesses and products. Net interest income was up 8% over the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth, but this was partially offset by declines in loan spreads. While loan yields did stabilized sequentially, we would still expect modest downward pressure going forward given the current environment for new production yields.
Average loans were flat sequentially and up 10% year-over-year, driven by gains across most of our client segments. Our markets remain competitive, and we are being more selective to ensure we earn appropriate overall relationship returns. While pipelines are healthy and commitments are going, both of which demonstrates increased activity in both new client acquisition and expanding existing relationships.
Deposits were up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payments product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist effort, allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients deposit needs.
Noninterest income was up 10% over the prior year driven by record performances in multiple investment banking product groups, including syndications, high-yield, investment-grade and equity capital markets. Our market share gains are a direct result of the continued investment in talent to expand and diversify our capabilities, but also due to our continued move towards the left on deals as bankers continue to have more strategic dialogue with clients. This is further evidenced by the fact that our M&A and equity related revenues in the first half of 2015 were up 38% compared to the same period a year ago and higher than they were in all of 2012. 
We continue to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capabilities to not only our larger corporate client base, but also to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth clients, a value proposition that has been very well-received. 
Noninterest expense was up over the prior year largely due to continued strategic investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio, which is very accretive to the overall company.
We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and that we have large bank capabilities and talent with a focus on mid-corporate and middle market clients. Near term, investment banking income will likely decline given the record performance this quarter, a normal seasonality, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth outlook for the overall Wholesale Banking segment. 
To move into the mortgage segment where adjusted net income was stable sequentially and up $24 million over the prior year. Sequential revenue trends were impacted by higher rates in the quarter. However, expenses were flat and our risk profile continue to improve, both of which were important components in maintaining solid overall profitability trends.
Getting into the details, revenues were down year-over-year driven primarily by $19 million gain on the sale of loans in the prior year, otherwise, the increase in production-related income due to a 60% increase in closed loan volume was mostly offset by a decline in servicing income, which occurred because of the higher prepayment activity. 
Compared to the prior quarter, revenues declined due to lower production income as a result of the lower refinanced activity and reduced all-in gain-on-sale margins and lower servicing income. While servicing income declined given prepayment activity and higher hedging cost, the overall servicing portfolio increased sequentially and is up 12% year-over-year, largely due to continued portfolio acquisitions.
Application volume declined 10% sequentially, though it's up 31% over the prior year, which will support solid year-over-year growth rates and production. Refinance activity abated as rates rose in the second quarter, however, purchase activity levels continue to be healthy, with applications and close loans are up 20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the prior year. 
Asset quality improved further this quarter as we continue to derisk the portfolio, primarily evidenced by a 42% reduction in nonperforming loans as a result of $110 million transfer of loans to held for sale. 
Provision expense was again negative this quarter as the pace of asset quality improvement remained strong. Given the quality of new production, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend positively.
Adjusted expenses were stable sequentially and year-over-year because cost-saving efforts and lower operating losses have offset growth and production-related cost and investment in technology. In particular, we deployed a new origination system for our retail and consumer direct channels during the quarter. Over time, this new technology will facilitate a faster and simpler loan process for our clients, while also improving teammate productivity. 
Mortgages continue to be an important financial product for our clients, and we're committed to continuing to improve the client experience and it stayed true our purpose of leading the way to financial well-being.
So in summary, our company's performance this quarter reflected solid progress across key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns. 
Net interest income and margin are beginning to stabilize and our focus on returns will remain a priority. Noninterest income trends are positive and reflective of our consistent strategy to meet more client needs. In addition, we're mindful of the intent expense discipline required to operate in this environment and to support continued growth investments so that we can deliver on our efficiency goals and provide further long-term value for our clients and our shareholders. 
As I said earlier, I continue to be very optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to execute against those strategies. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur and we'll begin the Q&A."

As we think about our businesses overall, particularly in consumer, what we're enjoying right now is the ability to grow our direct consumer business at a nice pace. And that business generates not only new consumer relationships for us. It generates them at a relatively low-cost and relatively high ROA. And along with that, we're able to move the lower ROA businesses or loans off our balance sheet. I guess, part of your question might relate to the auto securitization that we did in the second quarter, and this is the first time we've entered that market in about 8 years-or-so. And we were able to take $1 billion of relatively low ROA, low coupon loans off our balance sheet completely and improve the ROA dramatically in that business, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of our strong origination engines and be a partner to our auto dealers. So this is an area of focus for us for some time. As you know, we've been doing this with government guarantee loans. We've been doing this with student loans. We're now doing this with indirect auto. So this isn't a change in philosophy for us. But we're able to continue moving down the path and grow ROA overall across the company by focusing on business after business after business and improving ROA across-the-board."

If you think back a few years ago, we were sort of modestly liability sensitive as rates were coming down. Today, we're modestly asset-sensitive as we think rates are going up. And that's generally the way we run the overall balance sheet. Our expectation today, which is sort of unchanged from the fall of 2014 is that there will be a rate hike around the end of this year and that the rate rise will overall be deliberately paced after that for the first year or 2. If you look at the swap books specifically and you think about the decline in income in the swap book, the largest driver of the decline in there hasn't been declines notionals. We've been generally consistent in the size of the book, but it's simply the effect of the lower-rate environment as the old swap coupons with higher rates are rolling off and we're putting new ones on at lower coupons. So overall, you're right, we have been generally dovish on rates. We do expect that overall rate hike will be deliberately paced then I think Allen confirm that view earlier this week. So we are continuing to manage the balance sheet in that context to mitigate the risk that we have as a company to lower for longer and to prevent the balance sheet risk profile from becoming too asset-sensitive, too quickly."

And as you know, people are making very reasonable and logical arguments for the past -- at both ends of that spectrum. It's going to be difficult how this plays out for several years before we see exactly what happens. But if you look at where we are, I think we fall sort of somewhere near the middle overall with the industry overall today enjoying this abundance of deposits and liquidity. It does seem reasonable to us to assume the deposit rates out on the way up will lag a little bit. If you go back and look at history and the last 2004, 2006 rate cycle, our own experience there was that our data range was between 20% and 50% and that range is sort of differing products, different differing products generated a range like that. As we look at this next rate cycle, a slow and deliberate move up would argue, along with liquidity for us -- for deposit data to be perhaps towards the bottom end of that but that's not necessarily what we're assuming. We're taking a more conservative view that. And as we model out different scenarios, we're tending to be a little bit more conservative on modeling and perhaps towards the top of that range, which I think is somewhat sort of in the middle of where the industry is overall."

And in our markets, the economies are doing well. Unemployment is down. GDP is up. And so the purchase business, I think, there is -- looking pretty good. In terms of MSR and servicing, Q2 was a little bit difficult for us because of all of the rate volatility that we had in Q2.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89 on net income to common of $467 million, up 14% per share sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year adjusted EPS. We demonstrated good progress this quarter on key strategies and goals, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns. 
Revenue improved 4% over the previous quarter but declined 2% from the prior year adjusted level. The sequential quarter increase can be attributed to both higher net interest income and noninterest income.
Net interest margin benefited from targeted balance sheet actions during the quarter in addition to slight improvement in core loan yields and continued growth in deposits. Average performing loans were down slightly from the prior quarter due primarily to loan sale activity driven by our continued focus on returns and paydowns in certain loan categories. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate and our relationships are deeper. And we'll continue to closely manage areas where the competitive environment is driving down returns.
Average client deposits were up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% year-over-year with continued broad-based growth, driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. 
Adjusted noninterest income grew 7% sequentially as we deepen client relationships across the company, evidenced by growth in investment banking, retail investment income and card fees. 
Mortgage-related income declined sequentially largely as a result of higher rates in the quarter, which drove lower refinance activity and higher hedging-related costs. 
Adjusted expenses were down 2% from the prior year, driven by lower operating losses and the sale of RidgeWorth. Sequentially, adjusted expenses increased 3% as strong overall performance, higher client activity levels and typical seasonal patterns generated increases in certain variable expense categories. In addition, we continue to invest in key growth areas. 
The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, 63.4% for the current quarter, which improved sequentially and year-over-year. And we are continuing to work towards the very challenging goal of being sub-63% for the full year 2015.
Our asset quality performance remained strong, with NPLs down 21% as we transferred a portion of the portfolio to held-for-sale. The net charge-off ratio declined to 26 basis points, reaching new multiyear lows. Our asset quality performance can be attributed in part to the significant actions we've taken over the past several years to derisk and diversify and improve the quality of our production.
ROA was 103 basis points this quarter, an 11% -- or 11 basis point increase sequentially and a 3 basis point improvement relative to last year's adjusted performance. 
Return metrics are important to us, and we continue to focus on strategies to deepen client relationships and optimize the usage and mix of the balance sheet. Our capital position improved slightly, with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. 
Growth in tangible book value per share also continued, up slightly from prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year. Sequential increases in capital ratios and tangible book value occurred alongside a 36% increase in our total capital return to shareholders.
So to recap, net interest margin is beginning to show signs of stabilization partially as a result of our balance sheet management efforts as we are cautiously optimistic that we've seen the trough in net interest income. Conversely, provision expense is likely at or near the bottom even if asset quality continues and conditions remain strong. 
Noninterest income trends are positive and reflective of our continued efforts to meet more client needs, but quarterly variability can be expected. Our focus on expense management and improving efficiency will remain high. 
Overall, I'm optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value for our shareholders. 
So with that as a brief overview, I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the results."
305901,303330494,834328,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year. As y",1994,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year. As you'll recall, adjustments to the second quarter of 2014 included the settlement of certain legacy mortgage matters, partially offset by the gain on sale of RidgeWorth, the net of which was a negative $0.09 per share impact to earnings.
The sequential quarter increase was driven by 4% revenue growth, a decline in the provision expense and a $0.03 discrete tax benefit in the current quarter. Noninterest expense did increase sequentially, but this was primarily related to business performance and activity levels, in addition to certain discrete items in the current and prior quarter, which I'll discuss later. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by an improved asset quality performance, continued expense discipline and higher mortgage and capital markets-related revenue, which together more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue and lower commercial loan swap income. 
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 2% sequentially, driven by 1 additional day, an improvement in core loan yields and higher commercial loan swap income. The premium amortization expense related to the securities portfolio was stable sequentially but will slightly decline next quarter due to portfolio actions we undertook during the period. 
Net interest margin improved 3 basis points primarily due to commercial loan swap income and a slight increase in consumer and mortgage loan yields. 
Relative to the guidance we provided in April, balance sheet management actions in the quarter, including adjusting duration and repaying higher-cost wholesale funding, benefited NIM.
Core C&I loan yields were stable sequentially, a positive sign after multiple quarters of continuous declines. With that said, new production C&I yields continue to be lower than portfolio yields and, thus, will likely put further pressure on the overall margin. We remain intensely focused on ensuring that we meet the full suite of our Wholesale Banking clients' needs, particularly with respect to capital markets and treasury and payments products.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $41 million, driven entirely by lower commercial loan swap income. Core margin compression due to the continued low rate environment was offset by positive loan and deposit growth. Looking forward, we expect third quarter net interest margins to be relatively stable to the second quarter level as the balance sheet management actions of the second quarter will fully be in the run rate and potentially offset core loan yield compression.
Despite the potential for stability next quarter, NIM will likely still grind down after that until interest rates begin to rise. Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to have a positive tilt toward rising rates and expect any increase in rates to be gradual and deliberately paced.
Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income increased $57 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher investment banking activity, growth in retail investment income and seasonal increases in other noninterest income categories, which offset the decline in mortgage-related income.
Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenues increasing $48 million as growth occurred across almost all product areas. Trading income was stable as lower core client-driven activity was offset by higher fair value marks on our debt. 
Mortgage production income declined $7 million due to lower lock volume and reduced gain-on-sale margins. We record gain-on-sale revenue at the time of rate lock, and thus, the majority of revenues related to the refinance activity of the prior quarter were recorded at that time. 
Mortgage servicing income declined $13 million due to higher decay expense as a result of the increase in closed loans and higher hedging costs given the increased rate volatility throughout the quarter. 
Retail investment income and card fees combined increased $12 million sequentially as we continue to deepen client relationships in the consumer-related businesses. We also recorded $14 million in net securities gains and a similar amount of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had no upfront P&L impact but modestly improved our forward NIM and net interest income profile. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income increased slightly as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income was able to offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $34 million sequentially due to business activity and performance in the second quarter in addition to typical seasonal trends. Personnel expense declined $15 million due mainly to the seasonal decline in benefits costs and FICO taxes, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation given improved business performance. 
Outside processing and software costs increased $15 million as a result of higher business activity levels and continued investments in technology as well as typical quarterly variability associated with the timing of rendering service. 
Marketing and customer development expense also increased $7 million as the first quarter typically has lower advertising costs. 
Other noninterest expense increased $38 million primarily due to $14 million of debt extinguishment costs recorded in the current quarter and $17 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the prior quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 2%, driven by the sale of RidgeWorth, lower operating losses and our continued overall focus around expense management.
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 63.4% in the second quarter, down 110 basis points compared to the prior quarter and 20 basis points better than last year. We delivered year-over-year improvement despite a $40 million decline in commercial loan swap income as we were able to grow noninterest income and reduce expenses.
As we've indicated in the prior 2 earnings calls, improvement in 2015 will be difficult given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. We will need to deliver strong efficiency and PPNR performance in the second half of the year to achieve our goal of being below 63% for 2015. We are working diligently to achieve this goal, but as Bill indicated earlier, it will be challenging.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9, where our performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 21% sequentially, primarily driven by the transfer of $110 million of loans to held-for-sale status. In addition, the net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points in the quarter, down 4 basis point from the prior quarter and 9 basis points from the prior year. The allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $59 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the even further improvement in asset quality, combined with more moderate loan growth during the second quarter. 
In addition, the results of the recent shared national credit exam are already reflected in our June 30 allowance. 
With respect to the energy portfolio, we have taken proactive actions in prior quarters to build reserves, and we will continue to remain vigilant given the uncertainty associated with oil and gas prices.
Asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable over the medium term given the economic environment, combined with the proactive actions we have taken to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of production. With that said, any given quarter may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today's low overall net charge-off and nonperforming ratios. 
Over the next couple of quarters, we expect provision expense to increase relative to the current quarter but remain lower than similar periods in 2014 given continued improvements in asset quality. After that, improvements in asset quality will abate, and economic and growth conditions will normalize. And thus, we would expect provision expense to much more closely match net charge-offs. 
The ultimate level of reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans declined slightly primarily due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization we completed during the quarter, combined with continued elevated paydowns in certain segments given the low interest rate and credit spread environments. The auto loan securitization was our inaugural transaction, and its success can be attributed to the strong One Team approach we have across many units within the company. 
Going forward, we will periodically conduct additional securitization transactions as they allow us to more efficiently use the balance sheet and diversify our funding sources while still being an active loan originator and partner to our auto dealership clients. 
C&I loans were relatively stable as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by targeted reductions in lower-return areas. Consumer direct loans were higher given continued growth in our online businesses. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.4 billion or 2%, driven by strong 9% growth in the C&I portfolio, partially offset by reductions in residential mortgage, indirect auto and student loans, largely due to the balance sheet management and optimization activities we have executed over the past few quarters. 
Consumer loans were unchanged year-over-year. However, the mix has improved, with growth in higher-return direct segments, offset by reductions in lower-return indirect segments. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and client activity levels remain healthy, and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.
Let's turn to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We're pleased with the improving momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects the overall focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments. Our corporate liquidity specialists within Wholesale Banking, our premier bankers within retail and our SummitView product are all specific examples of investments in talent and technology that have supported this deposit growth.
Importantly, the solid growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse change in rates paid or mix. Low-growth -- low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong while higher-cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the nonrate-based value proposition for clients.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was fairly stable at 9.8%. 
Tangible book value per share increased slightly from the prior quarter as growth in retained earnings offset the lower AOCI. Importantly, tangible book value per share is up a solid 7% year-over-year. 
The second quarter also marks the beginning of our 2015 capital plan. We repurchased $175 million of common stock, up from $115 million in the prior quarter and paid a $0.24 dividend, up 20% from the previous level. Our capital return program, combined with disciplined usage of employees' stock-based compensation, continues to gradually drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 4 million sequentially and 13 million year-over-year.
And lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016, requirement for 90%. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level."

In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year with the lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid",1438,"Okay, thanks, Aleem. In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year with the lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid, with revenue up 4%, which when combined with stable expenses, resulted in strong operating leverage, a 220 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio and 13% year-over-year growth on pre-provision net revenue. 
Net interest income has been steadily grinding higher in this segment both due to our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans declined sequentially due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization and also a $350 million student loan sale that was completed in April. 
Offsetting these reductions was solid growth in higher-return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card. The loan sale activity and growth of the direct portfolios are consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company. 
Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships particularly in our mass affluent and high-net worth segment. Our premier bankers in the SummitView platform are examples of talent and technology that are enabling this growth. 
Noninterest income growth was solid both sequentially and compared to a year ago. Retail investment income continues to grow, up 5% year-over-year, in large part due to increased client assets under management in our brokerage platform as we are meeting more of our clients' wealth management needs.
Card fees and credit card balances are also on a positive track. Continued growth in these areas will be important particularly given the downward pressure of traditional service charges. 
Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter and year as we maintained a disciplined approach to expense management while investing in areas associated with revenue growth initiatives. As I stated earlier, this strategy has been paying off as we are achieving positive operating leverage in this business. 
Bigger picture, the prolonged low rate environment continues to place pressure on the value of deposits. However, the balance sheet management strategies we have executed have mitigated some of this pressure. Our continued focus on meeting more client needs has generated positive momentum with regard to noninterest income and deposits, and we have further opportunity here. 
We continue to invest in our various digital platforms, and we're seeing results with steady increases in digital penetration and self-service deposits. 
The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic economies continue to perform well and are well positioned to meet -- and we are well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments.
Now moving on to Wholesale Banking, which has been the key growth engine for the company. And it posted a very strong quarter, with net income up 11% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Revenues grew 9% relative to the prior year and were a record, driven by broad-based growth across lines of businesses and products. 
Net interest income was up 8% over the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth, but this was partially offset by a decline in loan spreads. While loan yields did stabilize sequentially, we would still expect modest downward pressure going forward given the current environment for new production yields.
Average loans were flat sequentially and up 10% year-over-year, driven by gains across most of our client segments. Our markets remain competitive, and we are being more selective to ensure we earn appropriate overall relationship returns. Loan pipelines are healthy and commitments are growing, both of which demonstrate increased activity in both new client acquisition and expanding existing relationships.
Deposits were up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. And the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payments product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist effort, allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients' deposit needs.
Noninterest income was up 10% over the prior year, driven by record performances in multiple investment banking product groups, including syndications, high yield, investment grade and equity capital markets. Our market share gains are a direct result of the continued investment in talent to expand and diversify our capabilities but also due to our continued move towards the left lead on deals as bankers continue to have more strategic dialogue with clients. This is further evidenced by the fact that our M&A and equity-related revenues in the first half of 2015 were up 38% compared to the same period a year ago and higher than they were in all of 2012. 
We continue to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capabilities to not only our larger corporate client base but also to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth clients, a value proposition that has been very well received. 
Noninterest expense was up over the prior year largely due to continued strategic investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio which is very accretive to the overall company.
We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and that we have large bank capabilities and talent with a focus on mid-corporate and middle-market clients. Near term, investment banking income will likely decline given the record performance this quarter and normal seasonality, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth outlook for the overall Wholesale Banking segment. 
To move into the mortgage segment where adjusted net income was stable sequentially and up $24 million over the prior year. Sequential revenue trends were impacted by higher rates in the quarter. However, expenses were flat, and our risk profile continued to improve, both of which were important components in maintaining solid overall profitability trends.
Getting into the details, revenue were down -- revenues were down year-over-year, driven primarily by $19 million gain on the sale of loans in the prior year. Otherwise, the increase in production-related income due to a 60% increase in closed loan volume was mostly offset by a decline in servicing income, which occurred because of the higher prepayment activity. 
Compared to the prior quarter, revenues declined due to lower production income as a result of the lower refinance activity and reduced all-in gain-on-sale margins and lower servicing income. While servicing income declined given prepayment activity and higher hedging cost, the overall servicing portfolio increased sequentially and is up 12% year-over-year, largely due to continued portfolio acquisitions.
Application volume declined 10% sequentially, though it's up 31% over the prior year, which will support solid year-over-year growth rates and production. Refinance activity abated as rates rose in the second quarter. However, purchase activity levels continue to be healthy, with applications and closed loans up 20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the prior year. 
Asset quality improved further this quarter as we continue to derisk the portfolio, primarily evidenced by a 42% reduction in nonperforming loans as a result of $110 million transfer of loans to held-for-sale. 
Provision expense was again negative this quarter as the pace of asset quality improvement remained strong. Given the quality of new production, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend positively.
Adjusted expenses were stable sequentially and year-over-year because cost saving efforts and lower operating losses have offset growth in production-related cost and investments in technology. In particular, we deployed a new origination system for our retail and consumer direct channels during the quarter. Over time, this new technology will facilitate a faster and simpler loan process for our clients while also improving teammate productivity. 
Mortgages continue to be an important financial product for our clients, and we're committed to continuing to improve the client experience and stay true to our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being.
So in summary, our company's performance this quarter reflected solid progress across key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns. 
Net interest income and margin are beginning to stabilize, and our focus on returns will remain a priority. Noninterest income trends are positive and reflective of our consistent strategy to meet more client needs. In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and to support continued growth investments so that we can deliver on our efficiency goals and provide further long-term value for our clients and our shareholders. 
As I said earlier, I continue to be very optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to execute against those strategies. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur, and we'll begin the Q&A."

As we think about our businesses overall, particularly in consumer, what we're enjoying right now is the ability to grow our direct consumer business at a nice pace. And that business generates not only new consumer relationships for us. It generates them at a relatively low cost and relatively high ROA. And along with that, we're able to move the lower-ROA businesses or loans off our balance sheet. I guess part of your question might relate to the auto securitization that we did in the second quarter, and this is the first time we've entered that market in about 8 years or so. And we were able to take $1 billion of relatively low-ROA, low-coupon loans off our balance sheet completely and improve the ROA dramatically in that business while continuing to enjoy the benefits of our strong origination engines and be a partner to our auto dealers. So this is an area of focus for us for some time. As you know, we've been doing this with government guarantee loans. We've been doing this with student loans. We're now doing this with indirect auto. So this isn't a change in philosophy for us, but we're able to continue moving down the path and grow ROA overall across the company by focusing on business after business after business and improving ROAs across the board."

And our production virtually in every area, CRE would be an exception and indirect for the reasons we noted, but virtually in every area, we are up sequentially. So production is up, and that's the important health metric. Pipelines are up, and our commitments are up. So the things that we look at to see, do we have a healthy business and opportunities to increase our total needs met, continue to be healthy. So when we make the pivot, I don't know, I would say we're always in that mode. And as long as the production and other health metrics stay healthy, I'm pretty happy with where we are in generating noninterest income and continuing to improve returns."

If you think back a few years ago, we were sort of modestly liability-sensitive as rates were coming down. Today, we're modestly asset-sensitive as we think rates are going up, and that's generally the way we run the overall balance sheet. Our expectation today, which is sort of unchanged from the fall of 2014 is that there will be a rate hike around the end of this year and that the rate rise will overall be deliberately paced after that for the first year or 2. If you look at the swap books specifically and you think about the decline in income in the swap book, the largest driver of the decline there hasn't been declining notionals. We've been generally consistent in the size of the book, but it's simply the effect of the lower rate environment as the old swap coupons with higher rates are rolling off and we're putting new ones on at lower coupons. So overall, you're right, we have been generally dovish on rates. We do expect that the overall rate hike will be deliberately paced, and I think [indiscernible] confirmed that view earlier this week. So we're continuing to manage the balance sheet in that context to mitigate the risk that we have as a company to lower for longer and to prevent the balance sheet risk profile from becoming too asset-sensitive too quickly."

And it's going to be difficult to know how this plays out, I think, for several years before we see exactly what happens. But if you look at where we are, I think we fall sort of somewhere near the middle view overall. With the industry overall today enjoying this abundance of deposits and liquidity, it does seem reasonable to us to assume that deposit rates on the way up will lag a little bit. If you go back and look at history in the last 2004, 2006 rate cycle, our own experience there was that our beta range was between 20% and 50%, and that range is sort of differing products. Differing products generated a range like that. As we look at this next rate cycle, a slow and deliberate move up would argue, along with liquidity for us -- for deposit betas to be perhaps toward the bottom end of that, but that's not necessarily what we're assuming. We're taking a more conservative view than that. And as we model out different scenarios, we're tending to be a little bit more conservative in modeling in ALCO perhaps towards the top end of that range, which I think is somewhat sort of in the middle of where the industry is overall."

Total charge-offs in that business so far this year are less than $1 million. And current 30 day-plus delinquencies in LightStream are also less than $1 million. So it's exceedingly good credit quality. The growth rate is very good. The expense of generating those loans, given the digital platform, tends to be lower. So the ROAs tend to be higher there. Given that LightStream is a national platform, it's more difficult for us to generate deposit businesses from those clients, but we've been able to get some.

And in our markets, the economies are doing well. Unemployment is down. GDP is up. And so the purchase business, I think, there is looking pretty good. In terms of MSR and servicing, Q2 was a little bit difficult for us because of all of the rate volatility that we had in Q2.

So we've got about a 50% increase in revenue coming out of that business, which might be a good indicator for you as to our success in meeting client needs, not just in terms of broadening and covering more clients but getting deeper with the clients we have."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89 on net income to common of $467 million, up 14% per share sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year adjusted EPS. We demonstrated good progress this quarter on key strategies and goals, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns. 
Revenue improved 4% over the previous quarter but declined 2% from the prior year adjusted level. The sequential quarter increase can be attributed to both higher net interest income and noninterest income.
Net interest margin benefited from targeted balance sheet actions during the quarter in addition to slight improvement in core loan yields and continued growth in deposits. Average performing loans were down slightly from the prior quarter due primarily to loan sale activity driven by our continued focus on returns and paydowns in certain loan categories. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate and our relationships are deeper. And we'll continue to closely manage areas where the competitive environment is driving down returns.
Average client deposits were up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% year-over-year with continued broad-based growth, driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. 
Adjusted noninterest income grew 7% sequentially as we deepen client relationships across the company, evidenced by growth in investment banking, retail investment income and card fees. 
Mortgage-related income declined sequentially largely as a result of higher rates in the quarter, which drove lower refinance activity and higher hedging-related costs. 
Adjusted expenses were down 2% from the prior year, driven by lower operating losses and the sale of RidgeWorth. Sequentially, adjusted expenses increased 3% as strong overall performance, higher client activity levels and typical seasonal patterns generated increases in certain variable expense categories. In addition, we continue to invest in key growth areas. 
The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, 63.4% for the current quarter, which improved sequentially and year-over-year. And we are continuing to work towards the very challenging goal of being sub-63% for the full year 2015.
Our asset quality performance remained strong, with NPLs down 21% as we transferred a portion of the portfolio to held-for-sale. The net charge-off ratio declined to 26 basis points, reaching new multiyear lows. Our asset quality performance can be attributed in part to the significant actions we've taken over the past several years to derisk and diversify and improve the quality of our production.
ROA was 103 basis points this quarter, an 11% -- or 11 basis point increase sequentially and a 3 basis point improvement relative to last year's adjusted performance. 
Return metrics are important to us, and we continue to focus on strategies to deepen client relationships and optimize the usage and mix of the balance sheet. Our capital position improved slightly, with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. 
Growth in tangible book value per share also continued, up slightly from prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year. Sequential increases in capital ratios and tangible book value occurred alongside a 36% increase in our total capital return to shareholders.
So to recap, net interest margin is beginning to show signs of stabilization partially as a result of our balance sheet management efforts as we are cautiously optimistic that we've seen the trough in net interest income. Conversely, provision expense is likely at or near the bottom even if asset quality continues and conditions remain strong. 
Noninterest income trends are positive and reflective of our continued efforts to meet more client needs, but quarterly variability can be expected. Our focus on expense management and improving efficiency will remain high. 
Overall, I'm optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value for our shareholders. 
So with that as a brief overview, I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the results."
305901,303330494,834397,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year. As y",1994,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year. As you'll recall, adjustments to the second quarter of 2014 included the settlement of certain legacy mortgage matters, partially offset by the gain on sale of RidgeWorth, the net of which was a negative $0.09 per share impact to earnings.
The sequential quarter increase was driven by 4% revenue growth, a decline in the provision expense and a $0.03 discrete tax benefit in the current quarter. Noninterest expense did increase sequentially, but this was primarily related to business performance and activity levels, in addition to certain discrete items in the current and prior quarter, which I'll discuss later. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by an improved asset quality performance, continued expense discipline and higher mortgage and capital markets-related revenue, which together more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue and lower commercial loan swap income. 
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 2% sequentially, driven by 1 additional day, an improvement in core loan yields and higher commercial loan swap income. The premium amortization expense related to the securities portfolio was stable sequentially but will slightly decline next quarter due to portfolio actions we undertook during the period. 
Net interest margin improved 3 basis points primarily due to commercial loan swap income and a slight increase in consumer and mortgage loan yields. 
Relative to the guidance we provided in April, balance sheet management actions in the quarter, including adjusting duration and repaying higher-cost wholesale funding, benefited NIM.
Core C&I loan yields were stable sequentially, a positive sign after multiple quarters of continuous declines. With that said, new production C&I yields continue to be lower than portfolio yields and, thus, will likely put further pressure on the overall margin. We remain intensely focused on ensuring that we meet the full suite of our Wholesale Banking clients' needs, particularly with respect to capital markets and treasury and payments products.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $41 million, driven entirely by lower commercial loan swap income. Core margin compression due to the continued low rate environment was offset by positive loan and deposit growth. Looking forward, we expect third quarter net interest margins to be relatively stable to the second quarter level as the balance sheet management actions of the second quarter will fully be in the run rate and potentially offset core loan yield compression.
Despite the potential for stability next quarter, NIM will likely still grind down after that until interest rates begin to rise. Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to have a positive tilt toward rising rates and expect any increase in rates to be gradual and deliberately paced.
Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income increased $57 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher investment banking activity, growth in retail investment income and seasonal increases in other noninterest income categories, which offset the decline in mortgage-related income.
Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenues increasing $48 million as growth occurred across almost all product areas. Trading income was stable as lower core client-driven activity was offset by higher fair value marks on our debt. 
Mortgage production income declined $7 million due to lower lock volume and reduced gain-on-sale margins. We record gain-on-sale revenue at the time of rate lock, and thus, the majority of revenues related to the refinance activity of the prior quarter were recorded at that time. 
Mortgage servicing income declined $13 million due to higher decay expense as a result of the increase in closed loans and higher hedging costs given the increased rate volatility throughout the quarter. 
Retail investment income and card fees combined increased $12 million sequentially as we continue to deepen client relationships in the consumer-related businesses. We also recorded $14 million in net securities gains and a similar amount of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had no upfront P&L impact but modestly improved our forward NIM and net interest income profile. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income increased slightly as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income was able to offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $34 million sequentially due to business activity and performance in the second quarter in addition to typical seasonal trends. Personnel expense declined $15 million due mainly to the seasonal decline in benefits costs and FICO taxes, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation given improved business performance. 
Outside processing and software costs increased $15 million as a result of higher business activity levels and continued investments in technology as well as typical quarterly variability associated with the timing of rendering service. 
Marketing and customer development expense also increased $7 million as the first quarter typically has lower advertising costs. 
Other noninterest expense increased $38 million primarily due to $14 million of debt extinguishment costs recorded in the current quarter and $17 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the prior quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 2%, driven by the sale of RidgeWorth, lower operating losses and our continued overall focus around expense management.
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 63.4% in the second quarter, down 110 basis points compared to the prior quarter and 20 basis points better than last year. We delivered year-over-year improvement despite a $40 million decline in commercial loan swap income as we were able to grow noninterest income and reduce expenses.
As we've indicated in the prior 2 earnings calls, improvement in 2015 will be difficult given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. We will need to deliver strong efficiency and PPNR performance in the second half of the year to achieve our goal of being below 63% for 2015. We are working diligently to achieve this goal, but as Bill indicated earlier, it will be challenging.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 9, where our performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 21% sequentially, primarily driven by the transfer of $110 million of loans to held-for-sale status. In addition, the net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points in the quarter, down 4 basis point from the prior quarter and 9 basis points from the prior year. The allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $59 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the even further improvement in asset quality, combined with more moderate loan growth during the second quarter. 
In addition, the results of the recent shared national credit exam are already reflected in our June 30 allowance. 
With respect to the energy portfolio, we have taken proactive actions in prior quarters to build reserves, and we will continue to remain vigilant given the uncertainty associated with oil and gas prices.
Asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable over the medium term given the economic environment, combined with the proactive actions we have taken to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of production. With that said, any given quarter may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today's low overall net charge-off and nonperforming ratios. 
Over the next couple of quarters, we expect provision expense to increase relative to the current quarter but remain lower than similar periods in 2014 given continued improvements in asset quality. After that, improvements in asset quality will abate, and economic and growth conditions will normalize. And thus, we would expect provision expense to much more closely match net charge-offs. 
The ultimate level of reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans declined slightly primarily due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization we completed during the quarter, combined with continued elevated paydowns in certain segments given the low interest rate and credit spread environments. The auto loan securitization was our inaugural transaction, and its success can be attributed to the strong One Team approach we have across many units within the company. 
Going forward, we will periodically conduct additional securitization transactions as they allow us to more efficiently use the balance sheet and diversify our funding sources while still being an active loan originator and partner to our auto dealership clients. 
C&I loans were relatively stable as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by targeted reductions in lower-return areas. Consumer direct loans were higher given continued growth in our online businesses. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.4 billion or 2%, driven by strong 9% growth in the C&I portfolio, partially offset by reductions in residential mortgage, indirect auto and student loans, largely due to the balance sheet management and optimization activities we have executed over the past few quarters. 
Consumer loans were unchanged year-over-year. However, the mix has improved, with growth in higher-return direct segments, offset by reductions in lower-return indirect segments. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and client activity levels remain healthy, and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.
Let's turn to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We're pleased with the improving momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects the overall focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments. Our corporate liquidity specialists within Wholesale Banking, our premier bankers within retail and our SummitView product are all specific examples of investments in talent and technology that have supported this deposit growth.
Importantly, the solid growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse change in rates paid or mix. Low-growth -- low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong while higher-cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the nonrate-based value proposition for clients.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was fairly stable at 9.8%. 
Tangible book value per share increased slightly from the prior quarter as growth in retained earnings offset the lower AOCI. Importantly, tangible book value per share is up a solid 7% year-over-year. 
The second quarter also marks the beginning of our 2015 capital plan. We repurchased $175 million of common stock, up from $115 million in the prior quarter and paid a $0.24 dividend, up 20% from the previous level. Our capital return program, combined with disciplined usage of employees' stock-based compensation, continues to gradually drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 4 million sequentially and 13 million year-over-year.
And lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016, requirement for 90%. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level."
305901,303330494,834397,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Okay, thanks, Aleem. In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year with the lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid",1438,"Okay, thanks, Aleem. In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year with the lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid, with revenue up 4%, which when combined with stable expenses, resulted in strong operating leverage, a 220 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio and 13% year-over-year growth on pre-provision net revenue. 
Net interest income has been steadily grinding higher in this segment both due to our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans declined sequentially due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization and also a $350 million student loan sale that was completed in April. 
Offsetting these reductions was solid growth in higher-return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card. The loan sale activity and growth of the direct portfolios are consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company. 
Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships particularly in our mass affluent and high-net worth segment. Our premier bankers in the SummitView platform are examples of talent and technology that are enabling this growth. 
Noninterest income growth was solid both sequentially and compared to a year ago. Retail investment income continues to grow, up 5% year-over-year, in large part due to increased client assets under management in our brokerage platform as we are meeting more of our clients' wealth management needs.
Card fees and credit card balances are also on a positive track. Continued growth in these areas will be important particularly given the downward pressure of traditional service charges. 
Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter and year as we maintained a disciplined approach to expense management while investing in areas associated with revenue growth initiatives. As I stated earlier, this strategy has been paying off as we are achieving positive operating leverage in this business. 
Bigger picture, the prolonged low rate environment continues to place pressure on the value of deposits. However, the balance sheet management strategies we have executed have mitigated some of this pressure. Our continued focus on meeting more client needs has generated positive momentum with regard to noninterest income and deposits, and we have further opportunity here. 
We continue to invest in our various digital platforms, and we're seeing results with steady increases in digital penetration and self-service deposits. 
The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic economies continue to perform well and are well positioned to meet -- and we are well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments.
Now moving on to Wholesale Banking, which has been the key growth engine for the company. And it posted a very strong quarter, with net income up 11% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Revenues grew 9% relative to the prior year and were a record, driven by broad-based growth across lines of businesses and products. 
Net interest income was up 8% over the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth, but this was partially offset by a decline in loan spreads. While loan yields did stabilize sequentially, we would still expect modest downward pressure going forward given the current environment for new production yields.
Average loans were flat sequentially and up 10% year-over-year, driven by gains across most of our client segments. Our markets remain competitive, and we are being more selective to ensure we earn appropriate overall relationship returns. Loan pipelines are healthy and commitments are growing, both of which demonstrate increased activity in both new client acquisition and expanding existing relationships.
Deposits were up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. And the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payments product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist effort, allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients' deposit needs.
Noninterest income was up 10% over the prior year, driven by record performances in multiple investment banking product groups, including syndications, high yield, investment grade and equity capital markets. Our market share gains are a direct result of the continued investment in talent to expand and diversify our capabilities but also due to our continued move towards the left lead on deals as bankers continue to have more strategic dialogue with clients. This is further evidenced by the fact that our M&A and equity-related revenues in the first half of 2015 were up 38% compared to the same period a year ago and higher than they were in all of 2012. 
We continue to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capabilities to not only our larger corporate client base but also to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth clients, a value proposition that has been very well received. 
Noninterest expense was up over the prior year largely due to continued strategic investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio which is very accretive to the overall company.
We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and that we have large bank capabilities and talent with a focus on mid-corporate and middle-market clients. Near term, investment banking income will likely decline given the record performance this quarter and normal seasonality, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth outlook for the overall Wholesale Banking segment. 
Moving to the mortgage segment, where adjusted net income was stable sequentially and up $24 million over the prior year. Sequential revenue trends were impacted by higher rates in the quarter. However, expenses were flat, and our risk profile continued to improve, both of which were important components in maintaining solid overall profitability trends.
Getting into the details, revenue were down -- revenues were down year-over-year, driven primarily by a $19 million gain on the sale of loans in the prior year. Otherwise, the increase in production-related income due to a 60% increase in closed loan volume was mostly offset by a decline in servicing income, which occurred because of the higher prepayment activity. 
Compared to the prior quarter, revenues declined due to lower production income as a result of the lower refinance activity and reduced all-in gain-on-sale margins and lower servicing income. While servicing income declined given prepayment activity and higher hedging cost, the overall servicing portfolio increased sequentially and is up 12% year-over-year, largely due to continued portfolio acquisitions.
Application volume declined 10% sequentially, though it's up 31% over the prior year, which will support solid year-over-year growth rates and production. Refinance activity abated as rates rose in the second quarter. However, purchase activity levels continue to be healthy, with applications and closed loans up 20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the prior year. 
Asset quality improved further this quarter as we continue to derisk the portfolio, primarily evidenced by a 42% reduction in nonperforming loans as a result of $110 million transfer of loans to held-for-sale. 
Provision expense was again negative this quarter as the pace of asset quality improvement remained strong. Given the quality of new production, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend positively.
Adjusted expenses were stable sequentially and year-over-year because cost saving efforts and lower operating losses have offset growth in production-related cost and investments in technology. In particular, we deployed a new origination system for our retail and consumer direct channels during the quarter. Over time, this new technology will facilitate a faster and simpler loan process for our clients while also improving teammate productivity. 
Mortgages continue to be an important financial product for our clients, and we're committed to continuing to improve the client experience and stay true to our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being.
So in summary, our company's performance this quarter reflected solid progress across key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns. 
Net interest income and margin are beginning to stabilize, and our focus on returns will remain a priority. Noninterest income trends are positive and reflective of our consistent strategy to meet more client needs. In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and to support continued growth investments so that we can deliver on our efficiency goals and provide further long-term value for our clients and our shareholders. 
As I said earlier, I continue to be very optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to execute against those strategies. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur, and we'll begin the Q&A."

I guess part of your question might relate to the auto securitization that we did in the second quarter, and this is the first time we've entered that market in about 8 years or so. And we were able to take $1 billion of relatively low-ROA, low-coupon loans off our balance sheet completely and improve the ROA dramatically in that business while continuing to enjoy the benefits of our strong origination engines and be a partner to our auto dealers. So this is an area of focus for us for some time. As you know, we've been doing this with government guarantee loans. We've been doing this with student loans. We're now doing this with indirect auto. So this isn't a change in philosophy for us, but we're able to continue moving down the path and grow ROA overall across the company by focusing on business after business after business and improving ROAs across the board."

If you think back a few years ago, we were sort of modestly liability-sensitive as rates were coming down. Today, we're modestly asset-sensitive as we think rates are going up, and that's generally the way we run the overall balance sheet. Our expectation today, which is sort of unchanged from the fall of 2014, is that there will be a rate hike around the end of this year and that the rate rise will overall be deliberately paced after that for the first year or 2. If you look at the swap books specifically and you think about the decline in income in the swap book, the largest driver of the decline there hasn't been declining notionals. We've been generally consistent in the size of the book, but it's simply the effect of the lower rate environment as the old swap coupons with higher rates are rolling off and we're putting new ones on at lower coupons. So overall, you're right, we have been generally dovish on rates. We do expect that the overall rate hike will be deliberately paced, and I think Chair Yellen confirmed that view earlier this week. So we're continuing to manage the balance sheet in that context to mitigate the risk that we have as a company to lower for longer and to prevent the balance sheet risk profile from becoming too asset-sensitive too quickly."

And it's going to be difficult to know how this plays out, I think, for several years before we see exactly what happens. But if you look at where we are, I think we fall sort of somewhere near the middle view overall. With the industry overall today enjoying this abundance of deposits and liquidity, it does seem reasonable to us to assume that deposit rates on the way up will lag a little bit. If you go back and look at history in the last 2004, 2006 rate cycle, our own experience there was that our beta range was between 20% and 50%, and that range is sort of differing products. Differing products generated a range like that. As we look at this next rate cycle, a slow and deliberate move up would argue, along with liquidity for us -- for deposit betas to be perhaps toward the bottom end of that, but that's not necessarily what we're assuming. We're taking a more conservative view than that. And as we model out different scenarios, we're tending to be a little bit more conservative in modeling in ALCO perhaps towards the top end of that range, which I think is somewhat sort of in the middle of where the industry is overall."

And in our markets, the economies are doing well. Unemployment is down. GDP is up. And so the purchase business, I think, there is looking pretty good. In terms of MSR and servicing, Q2 was a little bit difficult for us because of all of the rate volatility that we had in Q2.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter then I'm going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level. 
We delivered strong results this quarter, as we made further progress against our key strategies, which include optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing our capital return to shareholders. Earnings per share, after excluding $0.11 of noncore items, were $0.89, and up a solid 10% compared with the adjusted level a year ago.  
Our active the balance sheet management and optimization efforts improved our overall earning asset and funding mix, resulting in an 8 basis point improvement in net interest margin and $44 million sequential increase in net interest income. 
Period-end loans were up 1%, driven largely by growth in higher return consumer portfolios resulting in a more diversified and profitable loan mix. We remained confident in our ability to generate additional and targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate where we can have deeper relationships. However, we will continue to closely manage areas that are not meeting our thresholds and according with our goal of improving the overall returns of the company. 
Average deposits were up 2% sequentially as our core growth initiatives continue to gain momentum. Growing deposits, while also maintaining appropriate pricing discipline, remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. In addition, our strong deposit growth has allowed us to significantly reduce our higher cost wholesale funding over the last 6 months.
The sequential decline in noninterest income was driven by lower capital markets and mortgage production income, primarily the result of a strong second quarter, but also the result of challenging market conditions during the third quarter. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income increased 2%, primarily due to our continued success in meeting more of our clients' capital markets needs. This is further evidence of our differentiated Wholesale banking platform and the positive returns we're realizing on our investments in this segment. 
Expenses were stable relative to prior year at down 5% versus the prior quarter. While some of the sequential decline was nonrecurring and seasonal in nature, we continue to carefully manage expenses given this revenue environment. 
Our performance this quarter resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 61% for the third quarter and 62.9% year-to-date. As you all, we've been working diligently toward our goal of sub-63% for the full year, and we took another step in the right direction this quarter. Improving efficiency remains a strategic priority with a long-term goal of being sub-60%. 
Our asset quality performance continues to be very strong with NPLs down 4% and the net charge-off ratio declining 5 basis points to 21 basis points. This performance can be attributed to the significant actions we've taken over the past several years to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of our loan production. However, we also recognize that our provision expense is at very low levels and will eventually normalize. 
Our capital position improved slightly with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. We're able to improve our capital position, while also returning nearly 60% of our earnings to shareholders this quarter. 
So to recap, we delivered solid bottom line results that further enhance shareholder value this quarter with return on assets and return on tangible common equity increasing to 1.1% and 12.8%, respectively, and tangible book value per share increasing 4% sequentially. Our strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency continue to yield positive results, creating value for our clients and shareholders. 
So with that as an overview, I'm going to turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter's performance."

Earnings per share in the third quarter was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognize $0.07 of discrete",1789,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the third quarter was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognize $0.07 of discrete tax benefits this quarter, which were recorded as a lower provision for income taxes in addition to $0.04 of discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters, which were recorded in noninterest expense. 
Excluding these nonrecurring benefits, earnings per share were $0.89 and relatively stable to the second quarter as higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense were mostly offset by lower noninterest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, core earnings per share grew 10%, driven by a lower loan loss provision, higher capital markets and mortgage-related income and solid loan and deposit growth. All of which helps to counteract the 9 basis point decline in the net interest margins during that time frame. 
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio, lower wholesale funding and higher commercial loan swap income, each of which is a reflection of our continued efforts to actively manage and optimize our balance sheet. 
Net interest margin improved 8 basis points, primarily due to the same factors that drove the increase in net interest income, in addition to improved core loan yields and loan mix. Relative to the guidance we provided in July, NIM was higher-than-anticipated as we retired higher-cost wholesale funding and core loan yields were firm, albeit for just 1 quarter so far. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was fairly stable as the declines and earning asset yields were largely offset by growth in earning assets and also by the reduction in wholesale funding, which was in turn driven by the strong deposit growth we generated over the past year. 
Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable to the third quarter. Despite the expected stability next quarter, NIM will likely grind down in 2016 as long as interest rates remain low. 
Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to where net interest income would benefit from a rise in short-term rates, while also ensuring we carefully manage our risk to lower-for-longer scenarios. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income decreased $63 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the expected decline in capital markets related income given the record second quarter, coupled with increased market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking income was $115 million in the third quarter, down $30 million sequentially, but up $27 million compared to the prior year. Lower high yield and equity origination fees were the primary drivers of the sequential decline, while the strong year-over-year growth was driven by most product groups, in particular, M&A, a business we continue to grow as a result of building deeper client relationships and increased expertise. 
Trading income also declined in the third quarter as wider credit spreads and elevated volatility resulted in reduced client activity and lower valuations of inventory. 
Mortgage production income declined $18 million, primarily due to the anticipated decline in refinanced volumes. Gain-on-sale margins were also lower though primarily as a result of changes in channel mix. Conversely, mortgage servicing income increased to $10 million due to lower decay expense and higher levels of core servicing fees as a result of continued steady growth in the servicing portfolio. We also recorded $7 million in net securities gains and $11 million of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had a minor upfront negative the P&L impact, but will modestly improved our forward NIM and net interest income. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income was up 2% as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income offset the decline in service charges and trust and investment management income. 
Moving on to expenses. Noninterest expense declined $64 million sequentially due to lower personnel expenses in addition to discrete recoveries recognized in the third quarter. Personnel expenses declined $31 million due to higher levels of incentive-based compensation recorded in the previous quarter given strong business performance as well as declines in benefits costs and FICO taxes, some which is seasonal. 
Operating losses and other noninterest expense benefited from $20 million and $12 million, respectively, of separate discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase in marketing expenses due to higher advertising cost. 
Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense declined slightly as lower operating losses and personnel costs were partially offset by higher outside processing and software expenses. 
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.0% in the third quarter, down 90 basis points from the last year. Year-to-date, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio is now 62.9% and puts us on track to achieve our full year goal of being sub-63%. For several years now, we've been committed to becoming a more efficient and effective company, and we're highly focused on continuing to make progress toward our long-term efficiency ratio goal of sub-60%. 
Let's turn to credit quality on Slide 9. The net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points, down 5 basis points from the prior quarter and 18 basis points from the prior year. Nonperformers also declined slightly and now represent 35 basis points of loans. While overall asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable in the near term, future quarters will be impacted by discrete situations and factors given the current low levels of net charge-offs and nonperformers. 
The allowance for loan and lease losses and the AAA [ph] ratio declined $48 million and 5 basis points, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality. Provision expense increased slightly as lower net charge-offs were offset by higher loan growth and a smaller reserve release. 
With regard to our energy portfolio, we took further action this quarter to build additional reserves given the decline in commodity prices. As this portfolio represents only 2% of total loans with less than half of this portfolio in the EMP and oil field services sectors, our risk here remains very manageable. 
Similar to the guidance we provided in the previous quarter, we will [indiscernible] fourth quarter provision expense to increase sequentially, but be lower than the fourth quarter 2014 as a result of our efforts to improve asset quality.  
Looking into 2016, we expect provision expense to more closely match net charge-offs as the improvements in asset quality will abate. Wholesale net charge-offs are directly to increase from here as we do not believe the third quarter level is sustainable. Ultimately our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were relatively stable, due to the $1 billion auto securitization we completed in June. Period-end loans were up almost 1% relative to June 30 with growth across most loan categories. 
C&I loans declined slightly as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by continued elevated paydowns and further reductions in lower return portfolios. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.5 billion or 2%, driven by 6% growth in the C&I portfolio and $1.7 billion of growth in our consumer direct book as a result of continued momentum in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership. 
The growth in C&I and consumer direct loans was partially offset by continued paydowns in the home equity portfolio and reductions in indirect consumer loans given the competitive environment in auto lending. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and pipelines remain healthy, and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 10% compared to the prior year driven by growth across most lines of business. We continue to be pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflect our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer Private wealth and wholesale segments. In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within Wholesale Banking are doing an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payment product offerings. And as Bill noted earlier, our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher cost long-term debt by $4.6 billion over the past 6 months. 
Our broader enterprise-wide focus on deposits was also evident in the recent release of FDIC deposit market share data where SunTrust grew faster than the competition and increased our national market share by 4 basis points. Importantly, the strong growth we've delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher-cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing our value proposition for clients. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately another $250 million during Q3 as a result of growth in retained earnings and the estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 9.9%. 
Tangible book value per share increased 4% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. We repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the quarter per our 2015 capital plan. Our liquidity coverage ratio continue to exceed the January 1, 2016, 90% requirement. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Fitch Ratings last week, which was a reflection of our improved earnings profile, strong asset quality performance and balanced and diversified business model. Our credit ratings across all 3 major rating agencies have generally improved over the past year, which is positive for our teammates, clients and investors. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level."
305901,310977815,877434,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Great, thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13.

Core operating p",1487,"Great, thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. Our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment continue to demonstrate solid steady this quarter. Net income was up 7% over prior year driven mainly by lower provision expense. Core operating performance was also solid as pre-provision net revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year and 3% sequentially. 
Net interest income continues to steadily improve in this segment, they both are balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in higher-return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card, offset the impact of the $1 billion auto securitization in June. 
Deposits were up 6% year-over-year with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net worth segments. 
Our premier bankers and SummitView platform are examples of where our investments in talent and technology have accelerated our growth. We also introduced new checking account packages in August, simultaneously simplifying and improving our product offering, in addition to increasing our value proposition to students and families, consistent with our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. 
Noninterest income was down marginally compared to the prior quarter and year. Service charges remained pressured as client behavior continues to change. Wealth Management-related income declined modestly this quarter given market conditions, which resulted in lower assets under management and reduced transactional activity. Irrespective of short-term market fluctuations, many more of our clients investments needs continues to be strategic priority for the company. 
Expenses in this business have been an well-controlled, and we've been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing technology and talent. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments with steady increases in mobile penetration, digital sales and self-service deposits with the latter representing now 26% of total deposits received in the third quarter. 
Bigger picture, the progress we have made of optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. The economy is in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic market continue to perform well, and we are uniquely well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments. 
So let's go to wholesale next, which has been a key growth engine for the company and had a solid quarter, despite challenging market conditions. Total revenue was down 6% relative to the prior quarter but up 12% compared to prior year. The sequential quarter decline was driven by lower capital markets related income, primarily because we were coming off a record second quarter, but also due in part to market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking had a third highest quarter ever and was up 31% compared to a year ago. M&A investment-grade bond originations and equity sales and trading all had strong quarters, each a reflection of the strategic investments we've been making to expand and diversify our capabilities.  Strength in these product areas help to mitigate declines and high-yield bond and equity originations, driven by elevated market volatility. 
Trading income was lower this quarter as choppy market conditions led to increased volatility, wider credit spreads and reduced client activity. 
Net interest income was up 6% year-over-year driven by strong loan and deposit growth though this was partially offset by a decline in spreads. Average loans declined 1% sequentially and increased 6% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid growth across a number of industry verticals and lines of the businesses. However, this has been offset by elevated payoffs and intentional reductions in lower-return areas. 
While the overall environment remains competitive, we've seen more stability and portfolio and production units over the past few months. Production and pipeline trends are healthy, and we remain focused on generating profitable growth, both for SunTrust and our clients.
Deposits were up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year with broad-based growth across all major lines of businesses. Our strong performance here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payment product offerings, the success of our liquidity specialist in NCIB and increased intensity in meeting more of our wholesale client needs on the deposit front. 
Provision expense grew relative to the prior quarter and prior year as we continue to proactively increase the energy portfolio reserve given the decline of oil prices in the third quarter. With that said, SunTrust exposure to the exploration and production in oil field services sector, which are the more severely impacted by decline in oil prices continues to represent only 1% of our total loan portfolio. Overall asset quality and Wholesale Banking and the company continues to be very strong. 
Noninterest expense was up 6% over the prior year, largely due to the continued strategic investments in CIB and improved business performance, but more importantly, wholesale's overall efficiency ratio improved relative to last year. We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated as we bring large bank capabilities and a One Team approach to mid-corporate and middle-market clients. This differentiation has led to continued growth and left lead relationships both with corporate and commercial clients giving us continued optimism in the long-term growth outlook for the Wholesale Banking segment.
Now moving to the market segment where bottom line performance was aided by approximately $50 million of nonrecurring benefits, which Aleem discussed earlier. Excluding these benefits, mortgage still had a solid quarter as continued expense discipline and further derisking, combined with a larger servicing portfolio and an improving purchase market, mitigated the anticipated decline in refinance volumes. 
Revenues were relatively stable sequentially as higher servicing income help to offset the decline in production income, a reflection of the balance between servicing and production, particularly during periods of elevated refinance swings. 
Our servicing portfolio is up 12% compared to a year ago due largely to portfolio acquisitions as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business. 
On a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenue was primarily driven by $41 million loan sale gain in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding this gain, revenue was generally stable as higher noninterest income was generally offset by lower net interest income due to a decline in loan spreads and the prior year loan sale. 
Mortgage production income increased 29%, largely due to increased purchase activity in our markets as consumer confidence continues to steadily rise and the housing market recovers. Total applications increased 20% compared to the prior year with purchase applications up 15%, evidence of the continued rebound in the housing market in addition to lower rates. 
Asset quality improved this quarter, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans continue to be on a downward trajectory, resulting in further declines in the residential mortgage-related allowance. And given the quality of new production them a combined with a stable to improving housing market, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to tread favorably, but not necessarily at the level or pace of recent quarters. 
Expenses were lower both sequentially and year-over-year due primarily to discrete recoveries in the current quarter related to legacy matters. Excluding these items, expenses are still well-controlled as cost-saving efforts and reduced credit-related expenses have generally offset growth in production related in investments and technology. 
The big picture, after years of operating credit-related challenges, the mortgage business has become a more steady contributor to bottom line performance for the company, has also improved its focus and execution around creating a better quite experience and delivering the entire bank to our mortgage clients.
So before I conclude, I want to highlight our announcement yesterday regarding certain management changes. These changes align top talent with significant opportunities at our company and this will help sharpen our focus and enhance our growth prospects. Tom, Brad, Drum and are seasoned executives, and I'm confident in their individual and collective capability to lead their respective units and deliver on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. 
So to recap the third quarter, we made solid progress against key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing our capital return. Our active management of the balance sheet has resulted in an improved net interest income and margin. At the same time, while our asset quality performance is strong, current levels of provision expense are not sustainable in the long term. Year-over-year noninterest income trends are solid and reflective of our strategy to meet a wider array of client needs. In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and also to support continued investments in our company. Overall, I remain optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value to our clients and shareholders. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and let's take some Q&A."

Having said that, again, we're setting ourselves up so that we benefit from that type of an approach. In terms of expenses relative to revenue, we will continue to try to improve the efficiency of the company. We've been on a path now for many years. We're going to continue to be on that path.

And so clearly, in C&I, single-digit basis points won't be sustainable as the economy normalizes."

And then as I said earlier, there's something that we just said on the margin that's just not really creating profitable value for us. So we're just not going to play in that area. So I clearly think C&I will have positive growth. I mean, I think this is -- it's a 1 quarter deal. So over time, you've seen that. We've got 6% growth year-to-year based upon what I see it with pipeline, based on what I see in growth and unfunded commitment, based with what I see with clients and all the things that are the health metrics of our business, I would expect C&I will concede to grow but they will just be on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a sort of the same kind of examples look at each individual business within that and sort of make determinations. But I don't think we're in a flat environment in C&I growth, maybe that's the best way to summarize, that. And we will grow over time."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, then I'm going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level. 
We delivered strong results this quarter, as we made further progress against our key strategies, which include optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing our capital return to shareholders. Earnings per share, after excluding $0.11 of noncore items, were $0.89, and up a solid 10% compared with the adjusted level a year ago.  
Our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts improved our overall earning asset and funding mix, resulting in an 8-basis-point improvement in net interest margin and $44 million sequential increase in net interest income. 
Period-end loans were up 1%, driven largely by growth in higher return consumer portfolios resulting in a more diversified and profitable loan mix. We remain confident in our ability to generate additional and targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate and where we can have deeper relationships. However, we will continue to closely manage areas that are not meeting our thresholds and according with our goal of improving the overall returns of the company. 
Average deposits were up 2% sequentially, as our core growth initiatives continue to gain momentum. Growing deposits, while also maintaining appropriate pricing discipline, remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. In addition, our strong deposit growth has allowed us to significantly reduce our higher-cost wholesale funding over the last 6 months.
The sequential decline in noninterest income was driven by lower capital markets and mortgage production income, primarily the result of a strong second quarter, but also the result of challenging market conditions during the third quarter. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income increased 2%, primarily due to our continued success in meeting more of our clients' capital market's needs. This is further evidence of our differentiated Wholesale banking platform and the positive returns we're realizing on our investments in this segment. 
Expenses were stable relative to prior year, down 5% versus the prior quarter. While some of the sequential decline was nonrecurring and seasonal in nature, we continue to carefully manage expenses given this revenue environment. 
Our performance this quarter resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 61% for the third quarter and 62.9% year-to-date. As you all know, we've been working diligently toward our goal of sub-63% for the full year, and we took another step in the right direction this quarter. Improving efficiency remains a strategic priority with a long-term goal of being sub-60%. 
Our asset quality performance continues to be very strong with NPLs down 4% and the net charge-off ratio declining 5 basis points to 21 basis points. This performance can be attributed to the significant actions we've taken over the past several years to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of our loan production. However, we also recognize that our provision expense is at very low levels and will eventually normalize. 
Our capital position improved slightly with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. We're able to improve our capital position, while also returning nearly 60% of our earnings to shareholders this quarter. 
So to recap, we delivered solid bottom line results that further enhanced shareholder value this quarter, with return on assets and return on tangible common equity increasing to 1.1% and 12.8%, respectively; and tangible book value per share increasing 4% sequentially. Our strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet and investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency continue to yield positive results, creating value for our clients and shareholders. 
So with that as an overview, I'm going to turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter's performance."

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the third quarter was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognized $0.07 of discrete tax benefits this quarter, which were recorded as a lower provision for income taxes in addition to $0.04 of discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters, which were recorded in noninterest expense. 
Excluding these nonrecurring benefits, earnings per share were $0.89 and relatively stable to the second quarter, as higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense were mostly offset by lower noninterest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, core earnings per share grew 10%, driven by a lower loan loss provision, higher capital markets and mortgage-related income and solid loan and deposit growth. All of which helps to counteract the 9-basis-point decline in the net interest margin during that time frame. 
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio, lower wholesale funding and higher commercial loan swap income, each of which is a reflection of our continued efforts to actively manage and optimize our balance sheet. 
Net interest margin improved 8 basis points, primarily due to the same factors that drove the increase in net interest income, in addition to improved core loan yields and loan mix. Relative to the guidance we provided in July, NIM was higher than anticipated as we retired higher-cost wholesale funding and core loan yields were firm, albeit for just 1 quarter so far. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was fairly stable as the declines and earning asset yields were largely offset by growth in earning assets and also by the reduction in wholesale funding, which was in turn driven by the strong deposit growth we generated over the past year. 
Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable to the third quarter. Despite the expected stability next quarter, NIM will likely grind down in 2016 as long as interest rates remain low. 
Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to where net interest income would benefit from a rise in short-term rates, while also ensuring we carefully manage our risk to lower-for-longer scenarios. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income decreased $63 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the expected decline in capital markets related income given the record second quarter, coupled with increased market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking income was $115 million in the third quarter, down $30 million sequentially, but up $27 million compared to the prior year. 
Lower high yield and equity origination fees were the primary drivers of the sequential decline, while the strong year-over-year growth was driven by most product groups, in particular, M&A, a business we continue to grow as a result of building deeper client relationships and increased expertise. 
Trading income also declined in the third quarter as wider credit spreads and elevated volatility resulted in reduced client activity and lower valuations of inventory. 
Mortgage production income declined $18 million, primarily due to the anticipated decline in refinanced volumes. Gain-on-sale margins were also lower, though primarily as a result of changes in channel mix. Conversely, mortgage servicing income increased to $10 million due to lower decay expense and higher levels of core servicing fees as a result of continued steady growth in the servicing portfolio.
We also recorded $7 million in net securities gains and $11 million of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had a minor upfront negative the P&L impact, but will modestly improve our forward NIM and net interest income. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income was up 2%, as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income offset the decline in service charges and trust and investment management income. 
Moving on to expenses. Noninterest expense declined $64 million sequentially due to lower personnel expenses in addition to discrete recoveries recognized in the third quarter. Personnel expenses declined $31 million due to higher levels of incentive-based compensation recorded in the previous quarter, given strong business performance, as well as declines in benefits costs and FICO taxes, some which are seasonal. 
Operating losses and other noninterest expense benefited from $20 million and $12 million, respectively, of separate discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase in marketing expenses due to higher advertising cost. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense declined slightly as lower operating losses and personnel costs were partially offset by higher outside processing and software expenses. 
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.0% in the third quarter, down 90 basis points from the last year. Year-to-date, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio is now 62.9% and puts us on track to achieve our full year goal of being sub-63%. For several years now, we've been committed to becoming a more efficient and effective company, and we're highly focused on continuing to make progress toward our long-term efficiency ratio goal of sub-60%. 
Let's turn to credit quality on Slide 9. The net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points, down 5 basis points from the prior quarter and 18 basis points from the prior year. Nonperformers also declined slightly and now represent 35 basis points of loans. While overall asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable in the near term, future quarters will be impacted by discrete situations and factors given the current low levels of net charge-offs and nonperformers. 
The allowance for loan and lease losses and the ALLL ratio declined $48 million and 5 basis points, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality. Provision expense increased slightly as lower net charge-offs were offset by higher loan growth and a smaller reserve release. 
With regard to our energy portfolio, we took further action this quarter to build additional reserves given the decline in commodity prices. As this portfolio represents only 2% of total loans with less than half of this portfolio in the E&P and oil field services sectors, our risk here remains very manageable. 
Similar to the guidance we provided in the previous quarter, we will [indiscernible] fourth quarter provision expense to increase sequentially, but be lower than the fourth quarter 2014 as a result of our efforts to improve asset quality.  
Looking into 2016, we expect provision expense to more closely match net charge-offs as the improvements in asset quality will abate. Also, net charge-offs are likely to increase from here, as we do not believe the third quarter level is sustainable. Ultimately, our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which are then formed by trends in the loan portfolio, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were relatively stable, due to the $1 billion auto securitization we completed in June. Period-end loans were up almost 1% relative to June 30, with growth across most loan categories. C&I loans declined slightly as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by continued elevated paydowns and further reductions in lower-return portfolios.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.5 billion, or 2%, driven by 6% growth in the C&I portfolio and $1.7 billion of growth in our consumer direct book as a result of continued momentum in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership. 
The growth in C&I and consumer direct loans was partially offset by continued paydowns in the home equity portfolio and reductions in indirect consumer loans given the competitive environment in auto lending. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and pipelines remain healthy, and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 10% compared to the prior year driven by growth across most lines of business. We continue to be pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflect our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer Private Wealth and Wholesale segments.
In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within Wholesale Banking are doing an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill noted earlier, our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher-cost, long-term debt by $4.6 billion over the past 6 months. 
Our broader enterprise-wide focus on deposits was also evident in the recent release of FDIC deposit market share data, where SunTrust grew faster than the competition and increased our national market share by 4 basis points. Importantly, the strong growth we've delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher-cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing our value proposition for clients. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately another $250 million during Q3 as a result of growth in retained earnings, and the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 9.9%. 
Tangible book value per share increased 4% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. We repurchased $175 million of Common Stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the quarter per our 2015 capital plan. Our liquidity coverage ratio continue to exceed the January 1, 2016, 90% requirement. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Fitch Ratings last week, which was a reflection of our improved earnings profile, strong asset quality performance and balanced and diversified business model. Our credit ratings across all 3 major rating agencies have generally improved over the past year, which is positive for our teammates, clients and investors. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level."
305901,310977815,877482,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll start on Slide 13.

Core oper",1489,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll start on Slide 13. Our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment continue to demonstrate solid steady growth this quarter. Net income was up 7% over prior year driven mainly by lower provision expense. Core operating performance was also solid as pre-provision net revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year and 3% sequentially. 
Net interest income continues to steadily improve in this segment, they both are balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in higher-return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card, offset the impact of the $1 billion auto securitization in June. 
Deposits were up 6% year-over-year, with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net-worth segments. 
Our Premier Bankers and SummitView platform are examples of where our investments in talent and technology have accelerated our growth. We also introduced new checking account packages in August, simultaneously simplifying and improving our product offering, in addition to increasing our value proposition to students and families, consistent with our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. 
Noninterest income was down marginally compared to the prior quarter and year. Service charges remained pressured as client behavior continues to change. Wealth Management related income declined modestly this quarter given market conditions, which resulted in lower assets under management and reduced transactional activity. Irrespective of short-term market fluctuations, many more of our clients' wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for the company. 
Expenses in this business have been well controlled, and we've been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing technology and talent. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments, with steady increases in mobile penetration, digital sales and self-service deposits, with the latter representing now 26% of total deposits received in the third quarter. 
Bigger picture, the progress we have made of optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. The economy is in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic market continue to perform well, and we are uniquely well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments. 
So let's go to wholesale next, which has been a key growth engine for the company and had a solid quarter, despite challenging market conditions. Total revenue was down 6% relative to the prior quarter but up 12% compared to prior year. The sequential quarter decline was driven by lower capital markets related income, primarily because we were coming off a record second quarter, but also due in part to market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking had a third highest quarter ever and was up 31% compared to a year ago. M&A investment-grade bond originations and equity sales and trading all had strong quarters, each a reflection of the strategic investments we've been making to expand and diversify our capabilities.  Strength in these product areas help to mitigate declines and high-yield bond and equity originations, driven by elevated market volatility. 
Trading income was lower this quarter as choppy market conditions led to increased volatility, wider credit spreads and reduced client activity. 
Net interest income was up 6% year-over-year driven by strong loan and deposit growth though this was partially offset by a decline in spreads. Average loans declined 1% sequentially and increased 6% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid growth across a number of industry verticals and lines of the businesses. However, this has been offset by elevated payoffs and intentional reductions in lower-return areas. 
While the overall environment remains competitive, we've seen more stability and portfolio and production units over the past few months. Production and pipeline trends are healthy, and we remain focused on generating profitable growth, both for SunTrust and our clients.
Deposits were up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all major lines of businesses. Our strong performance here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payment product offerings, the success of our liquidity specialist in CIB and increased intensity in meeting more of our wholesale client needs on the deposit front. 
Provision expense grew relative to the prior quarter and prior year as we continue to proactively increase the energy portfolio reserve given the decline in oil prices in the third quarter. With that said, SunTrust's exposure to the exploration and production and oil field services sector, which are the more severely impacted by decline in oil prices, continues to represent only 1% of our total loan portfolio. Overall, asset quality and Wholesale Banking and the company continues to be very strong. 
Noninterest expense was up 6% over the prior year, largely due to the continued strategic investments in CIB and improved business performance, but more importantly, wholesale's overall efficiency ratio improved relative to last year. We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated as we bring large bank capabilities and a One Team approach to mid-corporate and middle-market clients. This differentiation has led to continued growth and left-lean relationships, both with corporate and commercial clients, giving us continued optimism in the long-term growth outlook for the Wholesale Banking segment.
Now moving to the mortgage segment, where bottom line performance was aided by approximately $50 million of nonrecurring benefits, which Aleem discussed earlier. Excluding these benefits, mortgage still had a solid quarter as continued expense discipline and further derisking, combined with a larger servicing portfolio and an improving purchase market, mitigated the anticipated decline in refinance volumes. 
Revenues were relatively stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income, a reflection of the balance between servicing and production, particularly during periods of elevated refinance swings. Our servicing portfolio is up 12% compared to a year ago due largely to portfolio acquisitions as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business. 
On a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenue was primarily driven by $41 million loan-sale gain in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding this gain, revenue was generally stable as higher noninterest income was generally offset by lower net interest income due to a decline in loan spreads and the prior year loan sale. 
Mortgage production income increased 29%, largely due to increased purchase activity in our markets as consumer confidence continues to steadily rise and the housing market recovers. Total applications increased 20% compared to the prior year, with purchase applications up 15%, evidence of the continued rebound in the housing market in addition to lower rates. 
Asset quality improved this quarter, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans continue to be on a downward trajectory, resulting in further declines in the residential mortgage-related allowance. And given the quality of new production, combined with stable to improving housing market, we would expect the overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to tread favorably, but not necessarily at the level or pace of recent quarters. 
Expenses were lower both sequentially and year-over-year due primarily to discrete recoveries in the current quarter related to legacy matters. Excluding these items, expenses are still well controlled as cost-saving efforts and reduced credit-related expenses have generally offset growth and production-related costs in investments and technology. 
Big picture, after years of operating credit-related challenges, the mortgage business has become a more steady contributor to bottom line performance for the company, has also improved its focus and execution around creating a better client experience and delivering the entire bank to our mortgage clients.
So before I conclude, I want to highlight our announcement yesterday regarding certain management changes. These changes align top talent with significant opportunities in our company, and this will help sharpen our focus and enhance our growth prospects. Tom, Brad, Jerome and Durenda [ph] are seasoned executives, and I'm confident in their individual and collective capability to lead their respective units and deliver on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. 
So to recap the third quarter, we made solid progress against key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing our capital return. Our active management of the balance sheet has resulted in an improved net interest income and margin. At the same time, while our asset quality performance is strong, current levels of provision expense are not sustainable in the long term.
Year-over-year noninterest income trends are solid and reflective of our strategy to meet a wider array of client needs. In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and also to support continued investments in our company. Overall, I remain optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value to our clients and shareholders. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and let's take some Q&A."

We, as you know, in our case, we had sort of been in the lower-for-longer camp for some time and set ourselves up to -- set ourselves appropriately for that type of an approach. As we look forward into '16, I think also lower for longer stays. I think if there are Fed increases, they will be very deliberate, and pace of rate rise will probably be slower now than the market had been thinking 6 months ago. Having said that, again, we're setting ourselves up so that we benefit from that type of an approach. In terms of expenses relative to revenue, we will continue to try to improve the efficiency of the company. We've been on a path now for many years. We're going to continue to be on that path, and we understand that we need to get better. So to the extent that we don't get a tailwind from rate rise, we'll be looking at other ways to grow income, whether that is net interest income or noninterest income. And we'll be looking for ways to manage expenses such that our efficiency ratio continues to keep us on that path of becoming more efficient."

So the answer is -- to all the questions is yes. I think we want to be able to grow the business where we can grow it, and all along being focused on the efficiency side. And if we see opportunities to invest, then that increases expenses, while at the same time improving efficiency, we're going to do it. If we don't see those opportunities, then we're going to grind down a little harder on the expense side.

And so that naturally makes us more and more asset-sensitive every month as we continue to do new business. The tail part of this is all the swaps do is take about 12% to 14% of those floating rate loans and effectively turn them into fixed-rate loans. So in the context of our overall book, it's sort of a smaller part of that. And what we'll do with the swaps and securities and which loans that we produce to emphasize and which loans we deemphasize really is going to be economy-dependent, client needs as well as our view of the structural balance sheet and structural rates.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, then I'm going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level. 
We delivered strong results this quarter, as we made further progress against our key strategies, which include optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing our capital return to shareholders. Earnings per share, after excluding $0.11 of noncore items, were $0.89, and up a solid 10% compared with the adjusted level a year ago.  
Our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts improved our overall earning asset and funding mix, resulting in an 8-basis-point improvement in net interest margin and a $44 million sequential increase in net interest income. 
Period-end loans were up 1%, driven largely by growth in higher return consumer portfolios resulting in a more diversified and profitable loan mix. We remain confident in our ability to generate additional and targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate and where we can have deeper relationships. However, we will continue to closely manage areas that are not meeting our thresholds and according with our goal of improving the overall returns of the company. 
Average deposits were up 2% sequentially, as our core growth initiatives continue to gain momentum. Growing deposits, while also maintaining appropriate pricing discipline, remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. In addition, our strong deposit growth has allowed us to significantly reduce our higher-cost wholesale funding over the last 6 months.
The sequential decline in noninterest income was driven by lower capital markets and mortgage production income, primarily the result of a strong second quarter, but also the result of challenging market conditions during the third quarter. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income increased 2%, primarily due to our continued success in meeting more of our clients' capital market's needs. This is further evidence of our differentiated Wholesale Banking platform and the positive returns we're realizing on our investments in this segment. 
Expenses were stable relative to prior year and down 5% versus the prior quarter. While some of the sequential decline was nonrecurring and seasonal in nature, we continue to carefully manage expenses given this revenue environment. 
Our performance this quarter resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 61% for the third quarter and 62.9% year-to-date. As you all know, we've been working diligently toward our goal of sub-63% for the full year, and we took another step in the right direction this quarter. Improving efficiency remains a strategic priority with a long-term goal of being sub-60%. 
Our asset quality performance continues to be very strong with NPLs down 4% and the net charge-off ratio declining 5 basis points to 21 basis points. This performance can be attributed to the significant actions we've taken over the past several years to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of our loan production. However, we also recognize that our provision expense is at very low levels and will eventually normalize. 
Our capital position improved slightly with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. We're able to improve our capital position, while also returning nearly 60% of our earnings to shareholders this quarter. 
So to recap, we delivered solid bottom line results that further enhanced shareholder value this quarter, with return on assets and return on tangible common equity increasing to 1.1% and 12.8%, respectively; and tangible book value per share increasing 4% sequentially. Our strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet and investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency continue to yield positive results, creating value for our clients and shareholders. 
So with that as an overview, I'm going to turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter's performance."

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the third quarter was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognized $0.07 of discret",1787,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the third quarter was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognized $0.07 of discrete tax benefits this quarter, which were recorded as a lower provision for income taxes in addition to $0.04 of discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters, which were recorded in noninterest expense. 
Excluding these nonrecurring benefits, earnings per share were $0.89 and relatively stable to the second quarter, as higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense were mostly offset by lower noninterest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, core earnings per share grew 10%, driven by a lower loan loss provision, higher capital markets and mortgage-related income and solid loan and deposit growth. All of which helps to counteract the 9-basis-point decline in the net interest margin during that time frame. 
We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio, lower wholesale funding and higher commercial loan swap income, each of which is a reflection of our continued efforts to actively manage and optimize our balance sheet. 
Net interest margin improved 8 basis points, primarily due to the same factors that drove the increase in net interest income, in addition to improved core loan yields and loan mix. Relative to the guidance we provided in July, NIM was higher than anticipated as we retired higher-cost wholesale funding and core loan yields were firm, albeit for just 1 quarter so far. 
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was fairly stable as the declines in earning asset yields were largely offset by growth in earning assets and also by the reduction in wholesale funding, which was in turn driven by the strong deposit growth we generated over the past year. 
Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable to the third quarter. Despite the expected stability next quarter, NIM will likely grind down in 2016 as long as interest rates remain low. 
Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to where net interest income would benefit from a rise in short-term rates, while also ensuring we carefully manage our risk to lower-for-longer scenarios. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income decreased $63 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the expected decline in capital markets related income given the record second quarter, coupled with increased market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking income was $115 million in the third quarter, down $30 million sequentially, but up $27 million compared to the prior year. 
Lower high yield and equity origination fees were the primary drivers of the sequential decline, while the strong year-over-year growth was driven by most product groups, in particular, M&A, a business we continue to grow as a result of building deeper client relationships and increased expertise. 
Trading income also declined in the third quarter as wider credit spreads and elevated volatility resulted in reduced client activity and lower valuations of inventory. 
Mortgage production income declined $18 million, primarily due to the anticipated decline in refinance volumes. Gain-on-sale margins were also lower, though primarily as a result of changes in channel mix. Conversely, mortgage servicing income increased $10 million due to lower decay expense and higher levels of core servicing fees as a result of continued steady growth in the servicing portfolio.
We also recorded $7 million in net securities gains and $11 million of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had a minor upfront negative P&L impact, but will modestly improve our forward NIM and net interest income. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest income was up 2%, as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income offset the decline in service charges and trust and investment management income. 
Moving on to expenses. Noninterest expense declined $64 million sequentially due to lower personnel expenses in addition to discrete recoveries recognized in the third quarter. Personnel expenses declined $31 million due to higher levels of incentive-based compensation recorded in the previous quarter, given strong business performance, as well as declines in benefits costs and FICA taxes, some of which is seasonal. 
Operating losses and other noninterest expense benefited from $20 million and $12 million, respectively, of separate discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase in marketing expenses due to higher advertising costs. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense declined slightly as lower operating losses and personnel costs were partially offset by higher outside processing and software expenses. 
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.0% in the third quarter, down 90 basis points from the last year. Year-to-date, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio is now 62.9% and puts us on track to achieve our full year goal of being sub-63%. For several years now, we've been committed to becoming a more efficient and effective company, and we're highly focused on continuing to make progress toward our long-term efficiency ratio goal of sub-60%. 
Let's turn to credit quality on Slide 9. The net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points, down 5 basis points from the prior quarter and 18 basis points from the prior year. Nonperformers also declined slightly and now represent 35 basis points of loans. While overall asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable in the near term, future quarters will be impacted by discrete situations and sectors given the current low levels of net charge-offs and nonperformers. 
The allowance for loan and lease losses and the ALLL ratio declined $48 million and 5 basis points, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality. Provision expense increased slightly as lower net charge-offs were offset by higher loan growth and a smaller reserve release. 
With regard to our energy portfolio, we took further action this quarter to build additional reserves given the decline in commodity prices. As this portfolio represents only 2% of total loans with less than half of this portfolio in the E&P and oil field services sectors, our risk here remains very manageable. 
Similar to the guidance we provided in the previous quarter, we will [indiscernible] fourth quarter provision expense to increase sequentially, but be lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of our efforts to improve asset quality.  
Looking into 2016, we expect provision expense to more closely match net charge-offs as the improvements in asset quality will abate. Also, net charge-offs are likely to increase from here, as we do not believe the third quarter level is sustainable. Ultimately, our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were relatively stable, due to the $1 billion auto securitization we completed in June. Period-end loans were up almost 1% relative to June 30, with growth across most loan categories. C&I loans declined slightly as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by continued elevated paydowns and further reductions in lower-return portfolios.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.5 billion, or 2%, driven by 6% growth in the C&I portfolio and $1.7 billion of growth in our consumer direct book as a result of continued momentum in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership. 
The growth in C&I and consumer direct loans was partially offset by continued paydowns in the home equity portfolio and reductions in indirect consumer loans given the competitive environment in auto lending. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and pipelines remain healthy, and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 10% compared to the prior year driven by growth across most lines of business. We continue to be pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the Consumer & Private Wealth and Wholesale segments.
In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within Wholesale Banking are doing an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill noted earlier, our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher-cost, long-term debt by $4.6 billion over the past 6 months. 
Our broader enterprise-wide focus on deposits was also evident in the recent release of FDIC deposit market share data, where SunTrust grew faster than the competition and increased our national market share by 4 basis points. Importantly, the strong growth we've delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher-cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing our value proposition for clients. 
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately another $250 million during Q3 as a result of growth in retained earnings, and the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 9.9%. 
Tangible book value per share increased 4% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. We repurchased $175 million of Common Stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the quarter per our 2015 capital plan. Our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016, 90% requirement. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Fitch Ratings last week, which was a reflection of our improved earnings profile, strong asset quality performance and balanced and diversified business model. Our credit ratings across all 3 major rating agencies have generally improved over the past year, which is positive for our teammates, clients and investors. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level."

Core ope",1493,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll start on Slide 13. Our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment continued to demonstrate solid steady growth this quarter. Net income was up 7% over prior year driven mainly by lower provision expense. Core operating performance was also solid as pre-provision net revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year and 3% sequentially. 
Net interest income continues to steadily improve in this segment through both our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in higher-return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card, offset the impact of the $1 billion auto securitization in June. 
Deposits were up 6% year-over-year, with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net-worth segments. 
Our Premier Bankers and SummitView platform are examples of where our investments in talent and technology have accelerated our growth. We also introduced new checking account packages in August, simultaneously simplifying and improving our product offering, in addition to increasing our value proposition to students and families, consistent with our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. 
Noninterest income was down marginally compared to the prior quarter and year. Service charges remain pressured as client behavior continues to change. Wealth Management related income declined modestly this quarter given market conditions, which resulted in lower assets under management and reduced transactional activity. Irrespective of short-term market fluctuations, meeting more of our clients' wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for the company. 
Expenses in this business have been well controlled, and we've been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing technology and talent. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments, with steady increases in mobile penetration, digital sales and self-service deposits, with the latter representing now 26% of total deposits received in the third quarter. 
Bigger picture, the progress we have made of optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. The economies is in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets continue to perform well, and we are uniquely well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments. 
So let's go to wholesale next, which has been a key growth engine for the company and had a solid quarter, despite challenging market conditions. Total revenue was down 6% relative to the prior quarter, but up 12% compared to prior year. The sequential quarter decline was driven by lower capital markets related income, primarily because we were coming off a record second quarter, but also due in part to market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking had its third highest quarter ever and was up 31% compared to a year ago. M&A investment-grade bond originations and equity sales and trading all had strong quarters, each a reflection of the strategic investments we've been making to expand and diversify our capabilities.  Strength in these product areas helped to mitigate declines and high-yield bond and equity originations, driven by elevated market volatility. 
Trading income was lower this quarter as choppy market conditions led to increased volatility, wider credit spreads and reduced client activity. 
Net interest income was up 6% year-over-year driven by strong loan and deposit growth though this was partially offset by a decline in spreads. Average loans declined 1% sequentially and increased 6% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid growth across a number of industry verticals and lines of the businesses. However, this has been offset by elevated payoffs and intentional reductions in lower-return areas. 
While the overall lending environment remains competitive, we've seen more stability in portfolio and production yields over the past few months. Production and pipeline trends are healthy, and we remain focused on generating profitable growth, both for SunTrust and our clients.
Deposits were up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all major lines of businesses. Our strong performance here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payment product offerings, the success of our liquidity specialist in CIB and increased intensity in meeting more of our wholesale client needs on the deposit front. 
Provision expense grew relative to the prior quarter and prior year as we continue to proactively increase the energy portfolio reserve given the decline in oil prices in the third quarter. With that said, SunTrust exposure to the exploration and production and oil field services sector, which are the most severely impacted by a decline in oil prices, continues to represent only 1% of our total loan portfolio. Overall, asset quality in Wholesale Banking and the company continues to be very strong. 
Noninterest expense was up 6% over the prior year, largely due to the continued strategic investments in CIB and improved business performance, but more importantly, wholesale's overall efficiency ratio improved relative to last year. We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated as we bring large bank capabilities and a One Team approach to mid-corporate and middle-market clients. This differentiation has led to continued growth and left-lead [ph] relationships, both with corporate and commercial clients, giving us continued optimism in the long-term growth outlook for the Wholesale Banking segment.
Now moving to the mortgage segment, where bottom line performance was aided by approximately $50 million of nonrecurring benefits, which Aleem discussed earlier. Excluding these benefits, mortgage still had a solid quarter as continued expense discipline and further derisking, combined with a larger servicing portfolio and an improving purchase market, mitigated the anticipated decline in refinance volumes. 
Revenues were relatively stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income, a reflection of the balance between servicing and production, particularly during periods of elevated refinance swings. Our servicing portfolio is up 12% compared to a year ago due largely to portfolio acquisitions as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business. 
On a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenue was primarily driven by a $41 million loan-sale gain in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding this gain, revenue was generally stable as higher noninterest income was generally offset by lower net interest income due to a decline in loan spreads and the prior year loan sale. 
Mortgage production income increased 29%, largely due to increased purchase activity in our markets as consumer confidence continues to steadily rise and the housing market recovers. Total applications increased 20% compared to the prior year, with purchase applications up 15%, evidence of the continued rebound in the housing market in addition to lower rates. 
Asset quality improved this quarter, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans continue to be on a downward trajectory, resulting in further declines in the residential mortgage-related allowance. And given the quality of new production, combined with stable to improving housing markets, we would expect the overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend favorably, but not necessarily at the level or pace of recent quarters. 
Expenses were lower both sequentially and year-over-year due primarily to discrete recoveries in the current quarter related to legacy matters. Excluding these items, expenses are still well controlled as cost-saving efforts and reduced credit-related expenses have generally offset growth in production-related costs and investments and technology. 
Big picture, after years of operating credit-related challenges, the mortgage business has become a more steady contributor to bottom line performance for the company, has also improved its focus and execution around creating a better client experience and delivering the entire bank to our mortgage clients.
So before I conclude, I want to highlight our announcement yesterday regarding certain management changes. These changes align top talent with significant opportunities in our company, and this will help sharpen our focus and enhance our growth prospects. Tom, Brad, Jerome and Durenda [ph] are seasoned executives, and I'm confident in their individual and collective capability to lead their respective units and deliver on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. 
So to recap the third quarter, we made solid progress against key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing our capital return. Our active management of the balance sheet has resulted in an improved net interest income and margin. At the same time, while our asset quality performance is strong, current levels of provision expense are not sustainable in the long term.
Year-over-year noninterest income trends are solid and reflective of our strategy to meet a wider array of client needs. In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and also to support continued investments in our company. Overall, I remain optimistic about our company's strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value to our clients and shareholders. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and let's take some Q&A."

But as you know, we're really just more focused on the efficiency ratio rather than on the expense number itself. And as long as we can continue to grow revenue, we're not averse to growing expenses as long as it helps revenue at a better pace, and we improve our operating leverage and efficiency ratio. If we do get revenue growth in the next year or 2, I wouldn't be surprised to see expenses move up, but continuing our trend of becoming a more efficient company. If revenue stays where it is, then think about expense levels around $1.3 billion, sort of give or take."

Looking forward, I wouldn't be surprised to see loan growth kind of at the pace we saw in Q3. That's not an unreasonable level given the relatively low economic growth that we're seeing across the country. I think the other place we might see some growth in earning assets, if you think about moving through '16, perhaps will be in the securities book as we need to move from the sort of 90% LCR compliance rate to 100% compliance rate in 2017. And that might require some additions in HQLA and securities.

As we look forward into '16, I think also lower for longer stays. I think if there are Fed increases, they will be very deliberate, and pace of rate rise will probably be slower now than the market had been thinking 6 months ago. Having said that, again, we're setting ourselves up so that we benefit from that type of an approach. In terms of expenses relative to revenue, we will continue to try to improve the efficiency of the company. We've been on a path now for many years. We're going to continue to be on that path, and we understand that we need to get better. So to the extent that we don't get a tailwind from a rate rise, we'll be looking at other ways to grow income, whether that is net interest income or noninterest income. And we'll be looking for ways to manage expenses such that our efficiency ratio continues to keep us on that path of becoming more efficient."

So the answer is -- to all the questions is yes. I think we want to be able to grow the business where we can grow it, and all along being focused on the efficiency side. And if we see opportunities to invest and that increases expenses, while at the same time improving efficiency, we're going to do it.

And then, I guess, related to that, despite the fact that it looks like you might have added some swaps, the asset sensitivity did go up a lot. So if you could just walk us through the puts and takes of what happened. I'm assuming it had something to do with prepayment speeds in the mortgage business."

And if you think about our overall loans, our natural position on loans is 60% of the loans that we generate and 60% of the loans that we produce are floating rate. And so that naturally makes us more and more asset-sensitive every month as we continue to do new business. The tail part of this is all the swaps do is take about 12% to 14% of those floating rate loans and effectively turn them into fixed-rate loans. So in the context of our overall book, it's sort of the smaller part of that. And what we'll do with the swaps and securities and which loans that we produce -- emphasize and which loans we deemphasize really is going to be economy dependent client needs, as well as our view of the structural balance sheet and structural rates.

But I do expect that as we go into 2016 and '17, we'll probably see charge-offs start to move back up again into that range. I think one example to think about there to really bring it home is when you look at our C&I book.

M&A had another really good quarter, and pipelines are still good there. The volatility numbers are in sort of the high-yield bond stuff and the equity sales and trading. And that's better. Spreads have come in. I think things will get done more this quarter than they did last quarter, if things stay stable. And based upon what I see in terms of our pipeline, I feel good about our pipeline. And I feel good about our pipeline, again, particularly in sort of those core areas. So what we saw and the decrease I saw was primarily related to specific volatility rather than any sort of chink in our strategy. And then as you highlighted, it also creates opportunity.

Now that we're on the backside of that, and we've changed all the underwriting, and now we're looking at a portfolio that's going to perform more like it did historically with very low losses expected for the foreseeable future without the risk of those big kind of spikes up, how do you think about allowing for that?

If you look at the mortgage segment slide that we've got in the deck, you do see we are actually releasing reserves. We've got a negative provision in that book this quarter. And as you look around the rest of the industry, you see, I think, kind of the same thing with the mortgage books and sort of home equity books generally looking better and better every quarter that we get away from the crisis with a lot of those reserves that have been set aside for those books starting to become apparently no longer required. And as that becomes more and more apparent over time, it's possible, as you say, that we'll continue to require fewer reserves for that book. And you could see negative provisioning against that. However, against that, if I think about the C&I book and my comments earlier about C&I charge-offs being at extremely low levels, I do expect that we'll see increased charge-offs and reserving required in C&I over time. And to some extent, that ought to offset the benefits that we're getting on the mortgage side."

I think one of the other benefits also that you see for SunTrust and perhaps for the industry overall is the benefit of CCAR. The CCAR has changed the way that companies think about their overall risk. They apply a stress test to all their portfolios now and think about how portfolios would behave during a stress test. One of the benefits for SunTrust specifically is how good we look in CCAR. We're a top decile performer.
