In the fourth quarter, we had solid results, all sides of the house. Kidney Care OI, $419 million, but that includes the net $29 million benefit from recognizing the deferred Medicare revenues, so $390 million without that. And HCP OI, $33 million, both results within our previously provided guidance ranges.
We'll cover clinical outcomes first as we do every call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. CMS issued final results on the Kidney Care side of the house recently. Once again, we led industry. Only 1.5% of our clinics had a 2015 penalty versus the overall industry's 5.6%. In other words, 73% more. This means we've outperformed the rest of the industry each year since that program began 4 years ago and in fact, remained [ph] first in 3 or 4 quick [ph] categories this time.
We also are leading the industry in 2015 Star rating results with over 50% of DaVita facilities receiving a Star rating of 4 or 5 versus 21% of the rest of the industry. So we're very proud of these results. 
And while no particular clinical metric by itself or system by itself is perfect, in aggregate, this is indisputably a strong performance for our patients and for the system. And we hope CMS continues to report clinical metrics and we'll work on them to do so -- and work with them to do so.
On the HealthCare Partners side, similarly strong use. Over 800,000 patients now for whom we take comprehensive care. If we just grabbed Nevada, 1 of our 3 largest markets and look at cancer screening and diabetes. We have 4 or [ph] 5 Star across all of our Medicare advantage patients, including some other factoid [ph] 70% of our patients receiving colorectal cancer screenings compared to a national average of 65%. And 63% of our diabetic patients with cholesterol scores below 100, both of those are 5 Star scores and that's compared also to a 55% national average. So for the clinical outcomes throughout the enterprise, very strong. We take it very seriously and in all these cases, healthier patients leads to savings to America's taxpayers, hopefully a value-added we can increasingly monetize for you.
I'm going to talk a little bit about HCP operating performance now and expected and Garry will talk a little bit more about Kidney Care.
HCP, $33 million NOI, right in the middle of the guidance for the quarter. But let's hit the bad news right upfront and that is that CMS may make what multiple changes the Medicare Advantage reimbursement. And in aggregate, this could mean that HealthCare Partners 2016 NOI could be below and even well below 2015, so unambiguous, potential bad news on that side.
We incorrectly handicapped the Medicare Advantage reimbursement cuts last year and I apologize that -- for that. I got it wrong. This actually is becoming a strategic issue for Medicare Advantage in our minds that it is crucial for CMS to protect the incentive to innovate to create health were neither sickness and reduce risks where it is high for these patients and we hope they realize that in their near-term decision-making.
Now let's switch to the good news front and here, I'll make 4 significant points. One, as I've been referred to, the strong clinical outcomes. Two, in our legacy markets, MA enrollment was up 7% year-over-year, meaning January '15 over January '14, excluding acquisitions. And if you include in-market acquisitions, it goes up to 10%. So that's fact #2. 
Fact #3 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, MA enrollment the year ago was 2,500. It's now about 11,000. And fee for service visits per provider are up 20% from last year's low point.
And then fact #4 on the positive side of the ledger. We told you 18 months ago that we were going to be exploring 4 different segments: Growth through IPAs, growth through payer partners, growth through health system partners and growth through acquiring prominent medical groups. We did the Phoenix IPA back right around that time and since that time, we've done a significant payer partnership, a significant health system partnership and a significant acquisition of a prominent medical group.
On the payer's side, [indiscernible] was a 50/50 JV with independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, the largest health plan in that region, now over 275 BCPs signed up, another 75 joining within about a month. We currently are taking care of 16,000 Medicare Advantage patients; 53,000 commercial patients; about $400 million in annualized revenue being managed in that partnership.
The next segment, health systems. We've got a 50/50 JV with Centura, partnering in Colorado. And there's a very substantial number of doctors that they alone have about 340 employed physicians, a mix of BCPs and specialists as well as a broader network. That's Centura, the largest health system in the state of Colorado. 
And then the last segment, leading medical groups, as many of you recall, we did acquire a leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs Health Partners with 51 BCPs. So the message here is that 18 months ago or 20 months ago, we said that we're going to explore growth models in each of those 4 segments, now 18 to 20 months later, we are doing just that with a strong entry in each one of those segments in order to explore the most capital efficient risk-adjusted optimal ways of growing as the years go by.
We continue to be very modest in our business development investment, although it is growing incrementally. Having said that, however, the activities are quite robust. In particular we're in discussions with several major health systems and in particular, particularly in Southern California in some very interesting discussions with a few different health systems and we look forward to deciding which ones to actually drive the closure and might do some very interesting things.
And that sets up some health systems. We're also talked in so there are several high-quality medical tips in a serious way. No one ever knows what's going to happen with the business pipeline but the quality and quantity of the conversations we're having is better than ever before. Our business development capabilities, as I said, is still quite modest. And hopefully over the next year or so, that will change. Although right now we couldn't deal with any more effective business development, since we're pretty much at capacity.
With respect to overall guidance, it is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion, which is relatively flat. It's made up of Kidney Care operating income. $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion; and HCP Operating income, $225 million to $275 million. 
I would like to reiterate the comments I made last earnings call, and that is we faced 2 serious headwinds right now for the enterprise. Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house under a lot of pressure in different forms. And then on the Kidney Care side, a tough commercial pay environment as you look out over the next few years. Not so much because of any change in negotiating dynamics or leverage, but because of architectural changes and the way the healthcare system is working.
When you put all of that together, as we said, the last Earnings Call, there is real risk that 2016 OI could be down from 2015 at the enterprise level.
Now even in a scenario where OI is flat, if we just take that premise for a moment, if you look out over the next 2 years between our current cash balance and our free cash flow and then you take out maintenance CapEx, still assume very robust [indiscernible de novos and we make our mandatory debt payments. So after doing those 3 things, business as usual, we will still have $2.4 billion in cash to deploy whatever way we thought was best for you and for the long-term strategic value of the enterprise. So acquisitions, buybacks, et cetera.
We very much look forward to discussing our longer-term strategic positioning and our outlook at our Capital Markets Day in New York City on May 5, in conjunction with our Q1 Earnings Call. More details will come out soon and we hope to see many of you there and satisfactorily answer all of your questions.
Garry, our CFO, please take over."

Starting with Kidney Care, non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.6% when normalized for days of the week.

Starting with Kidney Care, non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.6% when normalized for days of the week. Kidney Care operating profitability was up $11 million sequentially, primarily as a result of 2 factors: First the $29 million net favorable impact resulting from the revenue recognition of certain medical payments received in prior periods; and second, an unfavorable impact from a $3 per treatment increase in dialysis; and last segment G&A, which was caused by normal seasonal increases in G&A spending at the end of the year; and intentional non-recurring project investments in IT during the quarter. 
It is worth noting that despite the higher G&A spend in the quarter, G&A per treatment was down nearly 9% in 2014 compared to the year before. International losses were $16 million for the quarter and $42 million for the year, in line with prior guidance. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be similar to those in 2014. 
For the overall enterprise our debt expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $42 million was approximately $5 million higher than our normalized run rate due to recognition of the medical third revenue I discussed earlier. 
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners of 33.3% in the quarter was lower due to, one, a reduction in our tax reserve; and two, the incorporation of federal and state tax credits that were retroactively enacted by Congress in December 2014. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%.
I would also like to provide a few reminders as you model the normal seasonality for the first quarter of 2015 in our business.
In Kidney Care, first, Q1 2015 contains 3 fewer treatment days than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenue and higher fixed costs per treatment. Second, our payroll tax cuts reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. And third, Q1 will not benefit from the medical revenue that was recognized in the fourth quarter.
At HCP, operating income fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients and Q1 operating income tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average. Also the severity of our flu season can have a material impact on medical costs. We are seeing how utilization right now with the flu vaccine being only 23% effective according to the CDC. However, it is still too early to now have the flu season will play out, but we estimate that it impacted our operating income by $2 million to $4 million in Q4 2014 versus the comparable period in 2013.
Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $199 million in the fourth quarter and $1.728 billion for 2014, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the previously announced settlement with the government. This was within our guidance range. 
We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion lower than 2014, but in line with our historical trends. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes but we could be above or below this range.
Finally, some comments on capital deployment. We continue to have a very strong cash balance. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities where we could deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate after-tax cash returns on capital. We did not do any share repurchases in the fourth quarter nor have we done any to this point in 2015. We felt that it was prudent to wait until after next week's announcement of our Medicare Advantage rates before making any large capital deployment decisions. As we have said before, we favor a situational approach to capital deployment and we'll continue to review our options.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

They're playing with coding intensity, they're playing with the benchmark rate, they're playing with the coding, which we're particularly sensitive to because we have above average draft. They're playing with the Star system. And so there's 4, 5, 6 different levers that they are thinking about pulling. And of course, the economics are a result of that net number at the end. And so there's no magic sort of single line to draw and correlate it to 2016 outcomes. On the contracting front, we should have a better answer for you than we do. I know that we have picked up some significant incremental protection to the course of the year, but I can't translate it into sort of a percentage of the book of business or something like that. So why don't we just pledge Garry to have that for the next time around. I think it's been solid progress qualitatively, much better than where we were a year ago but not close to done yet. For example -- and Justin, for example, the kind of thing, so one that we signed recently, for example, any benefit design changes we end the plan basically spit them 50/50 up or down the cost of the benefit of doing them is shared in several line in terms of our macro economic incentives."

So there's no magical source of data that we have. We do have more susceptibility than others on the RAF coding front because we have an above-average RAF, because we have slightly older patients and we've had them for longer periods of time. And we're more disciplined in both collecting diagnoses as well as acting with on them, which is why we have superior clinical outcomes. So we're more sensitive on that score than others. But then there's the other 3, 4, 5 variables. And right now our concern is that the administration may not realize how close they are to actually reducing the incentive for people to invest in Medicare Advantage, which has been the source of tremendous innovation, cost reduction and clinical improvements. In a lot of markets, it's estimated now that once you get MA penetration up into that 35%, 40% range, the ripple effect in to affecting fee-for-service incentive is quite potential. There's a guy speaking in DC today who's well respected, he talked about as much as a 9% spillover effect. And so we worry that they -- some of them maybe trying to, if not kill the goose, they're playing the golden eggs cut off a leg."

So that's a mathematical answer to that. As to the dollars we're interesting in new capabilities in HCP, I did not know the number offhand. It is not a small number because we think the potential for credit long-term competitive advantage is quite substantial. Of course, there's an element of subjectivity if you add someone in cybersecurity as that count is new capability that's strategic or is that a new recurring operating expense or is it something in between? So I don't -- for capital markets perhaps, we could put something on the table that will give you a sense of what is incremental expenses that are very much tied to creating new capabilities to the future as opposed to just supporting existing.

In the fourth quarter, we had solid results, all sides of the house. Kidney Care OI, $419 million, but that includes the net $29 million benefit from recognizing the deferred Medi-Cal revenues, so $390 million without that. And HCP OI, $33 million, both results within our previously provided guidance ranges.
We'll cover clinical outcomes first as we do every call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. CMS issued final QIP results on the Kidney Care side of the house recently. Once again, we led industry. Only 1.5% of our clinics had a 2015 penalty versus the overall industry's 5.6%. In other words, 73% more. This means we've outperformed the rest of the industry each year since that program began 4 years ago and in fact, remained first in 3 or 4 QIP categories this time.
We also are leading the industry in 2015 Star rating results with over 50% of DaVita facilities receiving a Star rating of 4 or 5 versus 21% of the rest of the industry. So we're very proud of these results. 
And while no particular clinical metric by itself or system by itself is perfect, in aggregate, this is indisputably a strong performance for our patients and for the system. And we hope CMS continues to report clinical metrics and we'll work on them to do so -- and work with them to do so.
On the HealthCare Partners side, similarly strong news. Over 800,000 patients now for whom we take comprehensive care. If we just grab Nevada, 1 of our 3 largest markets and look at cancer screening and diabetes. We have 4 or 5 Star across all of our Medicare Advantage patients, including some other factoid, 70% of our patients receiving colorectal cancer screenings compared to a national average of 65%. And 63% of our diabetic patients with cholesterol scores below 100, both of those are 5 Star scores and that's compared also to a 55% national average. So for the clinical outcomes throughout the enterprise, very strong. We take it very seriously and in all these cases, healthier patients leads to savings to America's taxpayers, hopefully a value-added that we can increasingly monetize for you.
Let's talk a little bit about HCP operating performance now and expected and Garry will talk a little bit more about Kidney Care.
HCP, $33 million NOI, right in the middle of the guidance for the quarter. But let's hit the bad news right upfront and that is that CMS may make multiple changes to Medicare Advantage reimbursement. And in aggregate, this could mean that HealthCare Partners 2016 NOI could be below and even well below 2015, so unambiguous, potential bad news on that side.
We incorrectly handicapped the Medicare Advantage reimbursement cuts last year and I apologize that -- for that. I got it wrong. This actually is becoming a strategic issue for Medicare Advantage in our minds that it is crucial for CMS to protect the incentive to innovate to create health where now there is sickness and reduce risk  where it is high for these patients and we hope they realize that in the near-term decision-making.
Now let's switch to the good news front and here, I'll make 4 significant points. One, as already been referred to, the strong clinical outcomes. Two, in our legacy markets, MA enrollment was up 7% year-over-year, meaning January '15 over January '14, excluding acquisitions. And if you include in-market acquisitions, it goes up to 10%. So that's fact #2. 
Fact #3 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, MA enrollment a year ago was 2,500. It's now about 11,000. And fee-for-service visits per provider are up 20% from last year's low point.
And then fact #4 on the positive side of the ledger. We told you 18 months ago that we were going to be exploring 4 different segments: Growth through IPAs, growth through payer partners, growth through health system partners and growth through acquiring prominent medical groups. We did the Phoenix IPA back right around that time and since that time, we've done a significant payer partnership, a significant health system partnership and a significant acquisition of a prominent medical group.
On the payer's side, Tandigm was a 50/50 JV with independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, the largest health plan in that region, now over 275 PCPs signed up, another 75 joining within about a month. We currently are taking care of 16,000 Medicare Advantage patients; 53,000 commercial patients, about $400 million in annualized revenue being managed in that partnership.
The next segment, health systems. We've got a 50/50 JV with Centura, partnering in Colorado. And there's a very substantial number of doctors. They alone have about 340 employed physicians, a mix of PCPs and specialists as well as a broader network. That's Centura, the largest health system in the state of Colorado. 
And then the last segment, leading medical groups. As many of you recall, we did acquire a leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs Health Partners with 51 PCPs. So the message here is that 18 months ago, 20 months ago, we said that we're going to explore growth models in each of those 4 segments. Now 18 to 20 months later, we are doing just that with a strong entry in each one of those segments in order to explore the most capital efficient risk-adjusted optimal ways of growing as the years go by.
We continue to be very modest in our business development investment, although it is growing incrementally. Having said that, however, the activities are quite robust. In particular we're in discussions with several major health systems and in particular, in Southern California in some very interesting discussions with a few different health systems and we look forward to deciding which ones to actually drive to closure and may do some very interesting things.
And that separate from health systems. We're also talking to several high-quality medical groups in a serious way. No one ever knows what's going to happen with the business pipeline but the quality and quantity of the conversations we're having is better than ever before. Our business development capabilities, as I said, is still quite modest. And hopefully over the next year or so, that will change. Although right now we couldn't deal with any more effective business development, since we're pretty much at capacity.
With respect to overall guidance, it is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion, which is relatively flat. It's made up of Kidney Care operating income. $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion; and HCP Operating income, $225 million to $275 million. 
I would like to reiterate the comments I made last earnings call, and that is we faced 2 serious headwinds right now for the enterprise. Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house under a lot of pressure in different forms. And on the Kidney Care side, a tough commercial pay environment as you look out over the next few years. Not so much because of any change in negotiating dynamics or leverage, but because of architectural changes and the way the healthcare system is working.
When you put all that together, as we said, the last Earnings Call, there is real risk that 2016 OI could be down from 2015 at the enterprise level.
Now even in a scenario where OI is flat, if we just take that premise for a moment, if you look out over the next 2 years between our current cash balance and our free cash flow and then you take out maintenance CapEx, still assume very robust dialysis de novos and we make our mandatory debt payments. So after doing those 3 things, business as usual, we will still have $2.4 billion in cash to deploy whatever way we thought was best for you and for the long-term strategic value of the enterprise. So acquisitions, buybacks, et cetera.
We very much look forward to discussing our longer-term strategic positioning and our outlook at our Capital Markets Day in New York City on May 5, in conjunction with our Q1 earnings call. More details will come out soon and we hope to see many of you there and satisfactorily answer all your questions.
Garry, our CFO, please take over."

Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.6% when normalized for days of the week. Kidney Care operating profitability was up $11 million sequentially, primarily as a result of 2 factors: First, the $29 million net favorable impact resulting from the revenue recognition of certain Medi-Cal payments received in prior periods; and second, an unfavorable impact from a $3 per treatment increase in dialysis; and last segment G&A, which was caused by normal seasonal increases in G&A spending at the end of the year; and intentional nonrecurring project investment in IT during the quarter. 
It is worth noting that despite the higher G&A spend in the quarter, G&A per treatment was down nearly 9% in 2014 compared to the year before. International losses were $16 million for the quarter and $42 million for the year, in line with prior guidance. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be similar to those in 2014. 
For the overall enterprise our debt expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $42 million was approximately $5 million higher than our normalized run rate due to recognition of the Medi-Cal third revenue I discussed earlier. 
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners of 33.3% in the quarter was lower due to, one, a reduction in our tax reserves; and two, the incorporation of federal and state tax credits that were retroactively enacted by Congress in December 2014. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%.
I would also like to provide a few reminders as you model the normal seasonality for the first quarter of 2015 in our business.
In Kidney Care, first, Q1 2015 contains 3 fewer treatment days than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenue and higher fixed costs per treatment. Second, our payroll tax cuts resets at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. And third, Q1 will not benefit from the Medi-Cal revenue that was recognized in the fourth quarter.
At HCP, operating income fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients and Q1 operating income tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average. Also, the severity of a flu season can have a material impact on medical costs. We are seeing higher utilization right now with the flu vaccine being only 23% effective according to the CDC. However, it is still too early to now have the flu season will play out, but we estimate that it impacted our operating income by $2 million to $4 million in Q4 2014 versus the comparable period in 2013.
Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $199 million in the fourth quarter and $1.728 billion for 2014, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the previously announced settlement with the government. This was within our guidance range. 
We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion lower than 2014, but in line with our historical trends. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes but we could be above or below this range.
Finally, some comments on capital deployment. We continue to have a very strong cash balance. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities where we could deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate after-tax cash returns on capital. We did not do any share repurchases in the fourth quarter nor have we done any to this point in 2015. We felt that it was prudent to wait until after next week's announcement of our Medicare Advantage rates before making any large capital deployment decisions. As we have said before, we favor a situational approach to capital deployment and we'll continue to review our auctions.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

They're playing with coding intensity, they're playing with the benchmark rate, they're playing with the RAF coding, which we're particularly sensitive to because we have above average RAF. They're playing with the Star system. And so there's 4, 5, 6 different levers that they are thinking about pulling. And of course, the economics are a result of that net number at the end. And so there's no magic sort of single line to draw and correlate it to 2016 outcomes. On the contracting front, we should have a better answer for you than we do. I know that we have picked up some significant incremental protection through the course of the year, but I can't translate it into sort of a percentage of the book of business or something like that. So why don't we just pledge Garry to have that for the next time around. I think it's been solid progress qualitatively, much better than where we were a year ago but not close to done yet. For example -- and Justin, just for example, the kind of thing, so one that we signed recently, for example, any benefit design changes we -- in the plan basically spit them 50/50 up or down the cost of the benefit of doing them is shared.

I just want to understand, is there something that maybe shifted your view on the Medicare Advantage rates for 2016 in terms of industry chatter, consultants? The reason I'm asking, I guess, because the only really piece of hard information that we got in recent months to my knowledge is the trend -- preliminary trend factor, which as compared to a year ago when in December of 2013, it came out with very worrisome number. This time around, it was actually slightly positive. So I'm just wondering, is it because of where we are in the calendar that you're raising the issue now or have there been things recently that have got you particularly concerned?"

So there's no magical source of data that we have. We do have more susceptibility than others on the RAF coding front because we have an above-average RAF, because we have slightly older patients and we've had them for longer periods of time. And we're more disciplined in both collecting diagnoses as well as acting on them, which is why we have superior clinical outcomes. And so we're more sensitive on that score than others. But then there's the other 3, 4, 5 variables. And right now our concern is that the administration may not realize how close they are to actually reducing the incentive for people to invest in Medicare Advantage, which has been the source of tremendous innovation, cost reduction and clinical improvements. In a lot of markets, it's estimated now that once you get MA penetration up into that 35%, 40% range, the ripple effect into affecting fee-for-service expenses is quite substantial. There's a guy speaking in D.C. today who's well respected, he talked about as much as a 9% spillover effect.

What you have going on underneath that calm exterior is some nice profitability improvements in some countries offset by the increased expenses as we ramp up in Saudi Arabia, where we won that huge government contract for 5,000 patients. So that's the mathematical answer to that. As to the dollars we're investing in new capabilities in HCP, I did not know the number offhand. It is not a small number because we think the potential for creating long-term competitive advantage is quite substantial. Of course, there's an element of subjectivity if you add someone in cybersecurity, does that count as new capability that's strategic or is it just a new recurring normal operating expense or is it something in between? So I don't -- for capital markets perhaps, we can put something on the table that will give you a sense of what is incremental expenses that are very much tied to creating new capabilities for the future as opposed to just supporting existing.

Remember, CMS gets to pick which proposals for which markets and it's sometimes difficult to forecast then even within one of those selections exactly what the enrollment's going to be. But that maybe -- it's certainly not that we're going to have 20,000 patients and it's not that we're going to have 1,000. I mean we could have 0 if they don't award anything to us. So we'd be surprised and disappointed at that. So it's not 25 and it's not 1,000, but beyond that, I don't really remember. I think where CMS was is that in total, they wanted to have about 15,000 patients in the pilot. Now they may have gotten more aggressive on that but that used to be the number and if you assume that for 35% of the patients in America would be 35% of the ESCO patients, that would put us right about exactly where you were estimating."

In the fourth quarter, we had solid results, all sides of the house. Kidney Care OI, $419 million, but that includes the net $29 million benefit from recognizing the deferred Medi-Cal revenues, so $390 million without that. And HCP OI, $33 million, both results within our previously provided guidance ranges.
We'll cover clinical outcomes first, as we do every call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. CMS issued final QIP results on the Kidney Care side of the house recently. Once again, we led industry. Only 1.5% of our clinics had a 2015 penalty versus the overall industry's 5.6%. In other words, 73% more. This means we've outperformed the rest of the industry each year since that program began 4 years ago and in fact, remained first in 3 of 4 QIP categories this time.
We also are leading the industry in 2015 Star rating results with over 50% of DaVita facilities receiving a Star rating of 4 or 5 versus 21% of the rest of the industry. So we're very proud of these results. 
And while no particular clinical metric by itself or system by itself is perfect, in aggregate, this is indisputably a strong performance for our patients and for the system. And we hope CMS continues to report clinical metrics, and we'll work on them to do so -- and work with them to do so.
On the HealthCare Partners side, similarly strong news. Over 800,000 patients now for whom we take comprehensive care. If we just grab Nevada, 1 of our 3 largest markets, and look at cancer screening and diabetes. We have 4 or 5 Star across all of our Medicare Advantage patients, including some other factoid, 70% of our patients receiving colorectal cancer screenings compared to a national average of 65%, and 63% of our diabetic patients with cholesterol scores below 100. Both of those are 5 Star scores and that's compared also to a 55% national average. So for the clinical outcomes throughout the enterprise, very strong. We take it very seriously. And in all these cases, healthier patients leads to savings to America's taxpayers, hopefully a value-add that we can increasingly monetize for you.
Let's talk a little bit about HCP operating performance now and expected, and Garry will talk a little bit more about Kidney Care.
HCP, $33 million NOI, right in the middle of the guidance for the quarter. But let's hit the bad news right up front, and that is that CMS may make multiple changes to Medicare Advantage reimbursement. And in aggregate, this could mean that HealthCare Partners 2016 NOI could be below and even well below 2015, so unambiguous, potential bad news on that side.
We incorrectly handicapped the Medicare Advantage reimbursement cuts last year, and I apologize that -- for that. I got it wrong. This actually is becoming a strategic issue for Medicare Advantage in our minds that it is crucial for CMS to protect the incentive to innovate to create health where now there is sickness and reduce risk where it is high for these patients, and we hope they realize that in their near-term decision-making.
Now let's switch to the good news front and here, I'll make 4 significant points. One has already been referred to, the strong clinical outcomes. Two, in our legacy markets, MA enrollment was up 7% year-over-year, meaning January '15 over January '14, excluding acquisitions. And if you include in-market acquisitions, it goes up to 10%. So that's fact #2. 
Fact #3 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, MA enrollment a year ago was 2,500. It's now about 11,000. And fee-for-service visits per provider are up 20% from last year's low point.
And then fact #4 on the positive side of the ledger. We told you 18 months ago that we were going to be exploring 4 different segments: growth through IPAs, growth through payer partners, growth through health system partners and growth through acquiring prominent medical groups. We did the Phoenix IPA back right around that time and since that time, we've done a significant payer partnership, a significant health system partnership and a significant acquisition of a prominent medical group.
On the payer's side, Tandigm was a 50/50 JV with Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, the largest health plan in that region, now over 275 PCPs signed up, another 75 joining within about a month. We currently are taking care of 16,000 Medicare Advantage patients; 53,000 commercial patients, about $400 million in annualized revenue being managed in that partnership.
The next segment, health systems. We've got a 50/50 JV with Centura, partnering in Colorado. And there it's a very substantial number of doctors. They alone have about 340 employed physicians, a mix of PCPs and specialists as well as a broader network. That's Centura, the largest health system in the State of Colorado. 
And then the last segment, leading medical groups. As many of you recall, we did acquire a leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs Health Partners with 51 PCPs. So the message here is that 18 months ago, 20 months ago, we said that we're going to explore growth models in each of those 4 segments. Now 18 to 20 months later, we are doing just that with a strong entry in each one of those segments in order to explore the most capital-efficient, risk-adjusted, optimal ways of growing as the years go by.
We continue to be very modest in our business development investment, although it is growing incrementally. Having said that, however, the activities are quite robust. In particular we're in discussions with several major health systems and in particular, in Southern California in some very interesting discussions with a few different health systems, and we look forward to deciding which ones to actually drive to closure and may do some very interesting things.
And that's separate from health systems. We're also talking to several high-quality medical groups in a serious way. No one ever knows what's going to happen with the business pipeline, but the quality and quantity of the conversations we're having is better than ever before. Our business development capabilities, as I said, is still quite modest. And hopefully over the next year or so, that will change. Although right now we couldn't deal with any more effective business development, since we're pretty much at capacity.
With respect to overall guidance, it is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion, which is relatively flat. It's made up of Kidney Care operating income. $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion; and HCP Operating income, $225 million to $275 million. 
I would like to reiterate the comments I made last earnings call, and that is we face 2 serious headwinds right now for the enterprise. Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house under a lot of pressure in different forms. And on the Kidney Care side, a tough commercial pay environment as you look out over the next few years. Not so much because of any change in negotiating dynamics or leverage, but because of architectural changes in the way the healthcare system is working.
When you put all that together, as we said, the last earnings call, there is real risk that 2016 OI could be down from 2015 at the enterprise level.
Now even in a scenario where OI is flat, if we just take that premise for a moment, if you look out over the next 2 years between our current cash balance and our free cash flow and then you take out maintenance CapEx, still assume very robust dialysis de novos, and we make our mandatory debt payments. So after doing those 3 things, business as usual, we will still have $2.4 billion in cash to deploy in whatever way we thought was best for you and for the long-term strategic value of the enterprise. So acquisitions, buybacks, et cetera.
We very much look forward to discussing our longer-term strategic positioning and our outlook at our Capital Markets Day in New York City on May 5, in conjunction with our Q1 earnings call. More details will come out soon, and we hope to see many of you there and satisfactorily answer all your questions.
Garry, our CFO, please take over."

Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.6% when normalized for days of the week. Kidney Care operating profitability was up $11 million sequentially, primarily as a result of 2 factors: first, the $29 million net favorable impact resulting from the revenue recognition of certain Medi-Cal payments received in prior periods; and second, an unfavorable impact from a $3-per-treatment increase in dialysis and lab segment G&A, which was caused by normal seasonal increases in G&A spending at the end of the year and intentional nonrecurring project investment in IT during the quarter. 
It is worth noting that despite the higher G&A spend in the quarter, G&A per treatment was down nearly 9% in 2014 compared to the year before. International losses were $16 million for the quarter and $42 million for the year, in line with prior guidance. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be similar to those in 2014. 
For the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $42 million was approximately $5 million higher than our normalized run rate due to recognition of the Medi-Cal deferred revenue I discussed earlier. 
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners of 33.3% in the quarter was lower due to: one, a reduction in our tax reserves; and two, the incorporation of federal and state tax credits that were retroactively enacted by Congress in December 2014. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%.
I would also like to provide a few reminders as you model the normal seasonality for the first quarter of 2015 in our business.
In Kidney Care, first, Q1 2015 contains 3 fewer treatment days than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenue and higher fixed costs per treatment. Second, our payroll tax cuts reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. And third, Q1 will not benefit from the Medi-Cal revenue that was recognized in the fourth quarter.
At HCP, operating income fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 operating income tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average. Also, the severity of a flu season can have a material impact on medical costs. We are seeing higher utilization right now with the flu vaccine being only 23% effective according to the CDC. However, it is still too early to know how the flu season will play out, but we estimate that it impacted our operating income by $2 million to $4 million in Q4 2014 versus the comparable period in 2013.
Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $199 million in the fourth quarter and $1.728 billion for 2014, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the previously announced settlement with the government. This was within our guidance range. 
We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, lower than 2014 but in line with our historical trends. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.
Finally, some comments on capital deployment. We continue to have a very strong cash balance. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities where we could deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate after-tax cash returns on capital. We did not do any share repurchases in the fourth quarter nor have we done any to this point in 2015. We felt that it was prudent to wait until after next week's announcement about Medicare Advantage rates before making any large capital deployment decisions. As we have said before, we favor a situational approach to capital deployment, and we'll continue to review our options.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

They're playing with the Star system. And so there's 4, 5, 6 different levers that they are thinking about pulling. And of course, the economics are a result of that net number at the end. And so there's no magic sort of single line to draw and correlate it to 2016 outcomes. On the contracting front, we should have a better answer for you than we do. I know that we have picked up some significant incremental protection through the course of the year, but I can't translate it into sort of a percentage of the book of business or something like that. So why don't we just pledge Garry to have that for the next time around. I think it's been solid progress qualitatively, much better than where we were a year ago but not close to done yet.

But there's so much noise in the system now compared to before, with exchanges and narrow networks and everything else, that it's not as sort of linear a relationship as it used to be. But the answer to the narrow question you asked is it's been more or less flat for 12 quarters in a row."

But there's still a bunch that we -- where we are exposed. And it isn't that we suddenly wanted to reopen every single contract we had.

I just want to understand, is there something that maybe shifted your view on the Medicare Advantage rates for 2016 in terms of industry chatter, consultants? The reason I'm asking, I guess, because the only really piece of hard information that we got in recent months, to my knowledge, is the trend -- preliminary trend factor, which as compared to a year ago when in December of 2013, it came out with very a worrisome number. This time around, it was actually slightly positive. So I'm just wondering, is it because of where we are in the calendar that you're raising the issue now or have there been things recently that have got you particularly concerned?"

So there's no magical source of data that we have. We do have more susceptibility than others on the RAF coding front because we have an above-average RAF, because we have slightly older patients and we've had them for longer periods of time. And we're more disciplined in both collecting diagnoses as well as acting on them, which is why we have superb clinical outcomes. And so we're more sensitive on that score than others. But then there's the other 3, 4, 5 variables. And right now, our concern is that the administration may not realize how close they are to actually reducing the incentive for people to invest in Medicare Advantage, which has been the source of tremendous innovation, cost reduction and clinical improvements. In a lot of markets, it's estimated now that once you get MA penetration up into that 35%, 40% range, the ripple effect into affecting fee-for-service expenses is quite substantial. There's a guy speaking in D.C. today who's well respected, he talked about as much as a 9% spillover effect. And so we worry that they -- some of them may be trying to, if not kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs, cut off a leg."

So that's the mathematical answer to that. As to the dollars we're investing in new capabilities in HCP, I do not know the number offhand. It is not a small number because we think the potential for creating long-term competitive advantage is quite substantial. Of course, there's an element of subjectivity. If you add someone in cybersecurity, does that count as new capability that's strategic or is it just a new recurring normal operating expense or is it something in between?

Solid results in Q4 for both Kidney Care and HCP. I'll start by discussing our clinical outcomes first, as we always do.
176,000 dialysis patients in America, about 35% of the patients in America, 98% for the Kt/V of [ph] 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas place for access, and we'd like to talk a little bit about our VillageHealth metrics, where we're at the cutting edge of integrated care for these Kidney Care patients with numbers like a hospitalization rate 26% better than the USCSRD average. Readmission rate, 31% better then the U.S. ESRD average. And as low as 5% catheter rates in our special needs plans. Less than half are already industry-leading companywide rate, and 73% better than the US ESRD average. These are wonderfully exciting numbers with incredible clinical and economic benefits for society, cannot be scaled until we have a new government program, and we are hopeful in that regard and continue to work collaboratively with the government to try to move us there.
On the clinical side with respect to healthcare patients and our 830,000 patients there, for whom we provide true population health management, care individual by individual, but also the across the entire population. 
If you look at 2014, HEDIS clinical metrics and just there at California, our largest legacy market, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we were 4 of 5 Star across all MA patients on 8 of the 9 HEDIS metrics that are directly applicable to providers. So the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compare very favorably to national averages, which means healthier patients, higher patient satisfaction and savings to taxpayers.
But now back to those solid results. In Kidney Care, that translated into $409 million NOI, and HealthCare Partners, $72 million. Jim Holger will elaborate on the Kidney Care numbers, but I'll just provide a couple of highlights. The biggest good news is that our commercial mix and our rates both went up a bit. The biggest bad news is that our NAG, our non-acquired growth, went down. The commercial mix number is particularly significant, and that it shows it up to this point at least. Exchanges are not hurting us, as we continue to hold our commercial prices constant for this commercial segment in our mind. And one reason we're able to do that is because more and more payers are paying more and more attention to the total value proposition, which is to say our ability to reduce hospital rates, to reduce care -- cost of care in other areas continues to grow as the factor in determining the prices for the core treatment itself.
Now on to HealthCare Partners. Solid performance, but there were some onetime favorable and unfavorable items, so you shouldn't actually take the $72 million as the normalized number. Better to think of it as normalized at about $65 million, which is in line with our annual guidance after some of those onetime puts and takes.
On the business development front in HealthCare Partners, we are getting better. We have actually added full-time folks in the last few months. The first time since we did the deal. And we are not satisfied yet, but we're getting to be pretty darn competitive. We're in some high potential conversations, and our status as the leading independent medical group in America is one that puts us in incredibly good position for some of the high-quality conversations we're having. Separate from thinking about potential transactions, we are sitting at an MA lives number. That is 8.3% higher than the same time last year. So very nice growth stream underneath those numbers.
Moving on to guidance. For the balance of 2015 or for the total of 2015, depending on how you want to look at it, our enterprise guidance is now $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. What this means is we raised the bottom end of Kidney Care guidance by $25 million. It's consisting of Kidney Care being 1.6 to 1.65 and HCP being 2 25 to 2 75. 
If I were to step back for a moment and just comment on our outlook, we have 2 strong business positions, both enjoying some steady unit growth. Each with reasonably stable economics, although there's always some doing and throwing. And we are investing significantly for our future in improving our value proposition in ways that others will matter. And as specifically as requested, HealthCare Partners, we're continuing to make very good progress in creating a highly differentiated physician experience, a highly differentiated patient experience and more of a growth capability outside of the historical markets.
I'll now turn it over to Jim Hilger."

Starting with Kidney Care. Our Kidney Care operating profits increased $38 million sequentially, driven primarily by 3 main positive factors: Number one, higher number of treatment days in the quarter; number two, improved revenue per treatment due to improved commercial mix and commercial rates; and three, lower payroll taxes. These positive factors were partially offset by higher dialysis pharmaceutical expenses, driven by  higher average unit costs in the quarter and increased losses in our strategic initiatives in international business.
Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.7% normalized in the quarter. This was the lowest in quite sometime. While there's a single costs for this decline in our NAG, the -- some of the reasons include: Higher mistreatments during the flu season earlier in the year and efforts to improve the profitability of our acute business. This has put -- we have been putting a tighter screening on our new and existing relationships. And in some cases, exiting some hospital relationships where rates were too low to be sustainable.
As an example, we recently lost a hospital chain acute service contract to a competitor, because we were not willing to accept the low rates the hospitals offer. These efforts have improved acute revenue per treatment and OI, but haven't had an adverse of impact on our growth.
Now moving to G&A. G&A in our dialysis business was down from Q1 by about $2 per treatment, driven by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and a more treatment days in the quarter and also higher levels of legal consulting spend that occurred in the first quarter.
Please note that due to this higher legal spend in the first half of the year, we anticipate dialysis G&A per treatment will be slightly above last year's levels.
International losses were $15 million in the quarter, which includes an asset impairment of $4 million. Including this noncash charge, we now expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.
Moving now to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $104 million in the second quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $37 million.
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the second quarter was 39.2%, after excluding the $8 million tax adjustments related to the finalization of the Vainer settlement. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, again excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. And during the quarter, we repurchased $14 million in stock, but not subsequent to our last earnings announcement.
Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Our operating cash flow was $335 million in the second quarter, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the Vainer settlement. And we now expect our 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion, again excluding the Vainer settlement. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below the range.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

But we'll start by discussing our clinical outcomes first, as we always do.176,000 dialysis patients in America, about 35% of the patients in America, 98% for the Kt/V of 1.2 o",793,"Thank you, Jim. Solid results in Q4 (sic) [Q2] for both Kidney Care and HCP. But we'll start by discussing our clinical outcomes first, as we always do.
176,000 dialysis patients in America, about 35% of the patients in America, 98% for the Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access. And we'd like to talk a little bit about our VillageHealth metrics, where we're at the cutting edge of integrated care for these Kidney Care patients, with numbers like our hospitalization rate 26% better than the U.S. ESRD average, readmission rate, 31% better than the U.S. ESRD average, and as low as 5% catheter rates in our special needs plans. Less than half are already industry-leading company-wide rate, and 70% better than the U.S. ESRD average. These are wonderfully exciting numbers with incredible clinical and economic benefits for society, cannot be scaled until we have a new government program. And we are hopeful in that regard and continue to work collaboratively with the government to try to move us there.
On the clinical side, with respect to health care patients and our 830,000 patients there for whom we provide, through population health management, care of individual by individual but also across the entire population.
If you look at 2014, HEDIS clinical metrics and just stare at California, our largest legacy market, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we were 4- or 5-star across all MA patients on 8 of the 9 HEDIS metrics that are directly applicable to providers. So the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compare very favorably to national averages, which means healthier patients, higher patient satisfaction and savings to taxpayers.
But now back to those solid results. In Kidney Care, that translated into $409 million in OI, and HealthCare Partners, $72 million. Jim Hilger will elaborate on the Kidney Care numbers, but I'll just provide a couple of highlights. The biggest good news is that our commercial mix and our rates both went up a bit. The biggest bad news is that our NAG, our non-acquired growth, went down. The commercial mix number's particularly significant, in that it shows, up to this point at least, exchanges are not hurting us, as we continue to hold our commercial prices constant for this commercial segment in our mind. And one reason we're able to do that is because more and more payers are paying more and more attention to the total value proposition, which is to say our ability to reduce hospital rates, to reduce care -- cost of care in other areas continues to grow as the factor in determining the prices for the core treatment itself.
Now onto HealthCare Partners. Solid performance, but there were some onetime favorable and unfavorable items, so you shouldn't actually take the $72 million as the normalized number. Better to think of it as normalized at about $65 million, which is in line with our annual guidance after some of those onetime puts and takes.
On the business development front in HealthCare Partners, we are getting better. We have actually added full-time folks in the last few months. The first time since we did the deal. And we are not satisfied yet, but we're getting to be pretty darn competitive. We're in some high potential conversations, and our status as the leading independent medical group in America is one that puts us in incredibly good position for some of the high-quality conversations we're having. Separate from thinking about potential transactions, we are sitting at an MA lives number that is 8.3% higher than the same time last year. So very nice growth stream underneath those numbers.
Moving on to guidance for the balance of 2015 or for the total of 2015, depending on how you want to look at it. Our enterprise guidance is now $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. What this means is we raised the bottom end of Kidney Care guidance by $25 million. It's consisting of Kidney Care being $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and HCP being $225 million to $275 million.
If I were to step back for a moment and just comment on our outlook, we have 2 strong business positions, both enjoying some steady unit growth. Each with reasonably stable economics, although there's always some toing and froing. And we are investing significantly for our future in improving our value proposition in ways that others will matter. And specifically as with regards to HealthCare Partners, we're continuing to make very good progress in creating a highly differentiated physician experience, a highly differentiated patient experience and more of a growth capability outside of the historical markets.
I'll now turn it over to Jim Hilger."

Starting with Kidney Care. Our Kidney Care operating profits increased $38 million sequentially, driven primarily by 3 main positive factors: number one, higher number of treatment days in the quarter; number two, improved revenue per treatment due to improved commercial mix and commercial rates; and three, lower payroll taxes. These positive factors were partially offset by higher dialysis pharmaceutical expenses, driven by  higher average unit costs in the quarter and increased losses in our strategic initiatives in international business.
Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.7% normalized in the quarter. This was the lowest in quite sometime. While there's no single cause for this decline in our NAG, the -- some of the reasons include: higher mistreatments during the flu season earlier in the year and efforts to improve the profitability of our acute business. This has put -- we have been putting a tighter screening on our new and existing relationships. And in some cases, exiting some hospital relationships where rates were too low to be sustainable.
As an example, we recently lost a hospital chain acute service contract to a competitor because we were not willing to accept the low rates the hospitals offer. These efforts have improved acute revenue per treatment and OI, but have had an adverse impact on our growth.
Now moving to G&A. G&A in our dialysis business was down from Q1 by about $2 per treatment, driven by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and more treatment days in the quarter and also higher levels of legal and consulting spend that occurred in the first quarter.
Please note that due to this higher legal spend in the first half of the year, we anticipate dialysis G&A per treatment to be slightly above last year's levels.
International losses were $15 million in the quarter, which includes an asset impairment of $4 million. Including this noncash charge, we now expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.
Moving now to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $104 million in the second quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $37 million.
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the second quarter was 39.2%, after excluding the $8 million tax adjustments related to the finalization of the Vainer settlement. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, again excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. And during the quarter, we repurchased $14 million in stock but non-subsequent to our last earnings announcement.
Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Our operating cash flow was $335 million in the second quarter, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the Vainer settlement. And we now expect our 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion, again excluding the Vainer settlement. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below the range.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

Solid results in Q4 (sic) [Q2] for both Kidney Care and HCP. But we'll start by discussing our clinical outcomes first, as we always do.
176,000 dialysis patients in America, about 35% of the patients in America, 98% with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access. And we'd like to talk a little bit about our VillageHealth metrics, where we're at the cutting edge of integrated care for these Kidney Care patients, with numbers like a hospitalization rate 26% better than the U.S. ESRD average, a readmission rate 31% better than the U.S. ESRD average, and as low as 5% catheter rates in our special needs plans. Less than half our already industry-leading company-wide rate, and 70% better than the U.S. ESRD average. These are wonderfully exciting numbers with incredible clinical and economic benefits for society. It cannot be scaled until we have a new government program. And we are hopeful in that regard and continue to work collaboratively with the government to try to move us there.
On the clinical side, with respect to health care patients and our 830,000 patients there for whom we provide true population health management, care individual by individual but also across the entire population.
If you look at 2014, HEDIS clinical metrics and just stare at California, our largest legacy market, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we were 4- or 5-star across all MA patients on 8 of the 9 HEDIS metrics that are directly applicable to providers. So the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compared very favorably to national averages, which means healthier patients, higher patient satisfaction and savings to taxpayers.
But now back to those solid results. In Kidney Care, that translated into $409 million in OI, and HealthCare Partners, $72 million. Jim Hilger will elaborate on the Kidney Care numbers, but I'll just provide a couple of highlights. The biggest good news is that our commercial mix and our rates both went up a bit. The biggest bad news is that our NAG, our non-acquired growth, went down. The commercial mix number is particularly significant, in that it shows, up to this point at least, exchanges are not hurting us, as we continue to hold our commercial prices constant for this commercial segment in our mind. And one reason we're able to do that is because more and more payers are paying more and more attention to the total value proposition, which is to say our ability to reduce hospital rates, to reduce care -- cost of care in other areas continues to grow as a factor in determining the prices for the core treatment itself.
Now onto HealthCare Partners. Solid performance, but there were some onetime favorable and unfavorable items, so you shouldn't actually take the $72 million as the normalized number. Better to think of it as normalized at about $65 million, which is in line with our annual guidance after some of those onetime puts and takes.
On the business development front in HealthCare Partners, we are getting better. We have actually added full-time folks in the last few months. The first time since we did the deal. And we are not satisfied yet, but we're getting to be pretty darn competitive. We're in some high potential conversations, and our status as the leading independent medical group in America is one that puts us in an incredibly good position for some of the high-quality conversations we're having. Separate from thinking about potential transactions, we are sitting at an MA lives number that is 8.3% higher than the same time last year. So very nice growth stream underneath those numbers.
Moving on to guidance for the balance of 2015 or for the total of 2015, depending on how you want to look at it. Our enterprise guidance is now $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. What this means is we raised the bottom end of Kidney Care guidance by $25 million. It's consisting of Kidney Care being $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and HCP being $225 million to $275 million.
If I were to step back for a moment and just comment on our outlook, we have 2 strong business positions, both enjoying some steady unit growth. Each with reasonably stable economics, although there's always some toing and froing. And we are investing significantly for our future and improving our value proposition in ways that others will matter. And then specifically as requested, HealthCare Partners, we're continuing to make very good progress in creating a highly differentiated physician experience, a highly differentiated patient experience and more of a growth capability outside of the historical markets.
I'll now turn it over to Jim Hilger."
35644,307311850,848772,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kent. Starting with Kidney Care.

Starting with Kidney Care. Our Kidney Care operating profits increased $38 million sequentially, driven primarily by 3 main positive factors: number one, higher number of treatment days in the quarter; number two, improved revenue per treatment due to improved commercial mix and commercial rates; and three, lower payroll taxes. These positive factors were partially offset by higher dialysis pharmaceutical expenses, driven by higher average unit costs in the quarter and increased losses in our strategic initiatives in international business.
Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.7% normalized in the quarter. This was the lowest in quite sometime. While there was no single cause for this decline in our NAG, the -- some of the reasons include: higher missed treatments during the flu season earlier in the year and efforts to improve the profitability of our acute business. This has put -- we have been putting a tighter screen on our new and existing relationships. And in some cases, exiting some hospital relationships where rates were too low to be sustainable.
As an example, we recently lost a hospital chain acute service contract to a competitor because we were not willing to accept the low rates the hospitals offered. These efforts have improved acute revenue per treatment and OI, but have had an adverse impact on our growth.
Now moving to G&A. G&A in our dialysis business was down from Q1 by about $2 per treatment, driven by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and in more treatment days in the quarter and also higher levels of legal and consulting spend that occurred in the first quarter.
Please note that due to this higher legal spend in the first half of the year, we anticipate dialysis G&A per treatment to be slightly above last year's levels.
International losses were $15 million in the quarter, which includes an asset impairment of $4 million. Including this noncash charge, we now expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.
Moving now to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $104 million in the second quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $37 million.
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the second quarter was 39.2%, after excluding the $8 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the Vainer settlement. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, again excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. And during the quarter, we repurchased $14 million in stock, but none subsequent to our last earnings announcement.
Turning to cash flow. We continued to generate strong cash flows. Our operating cash flow was $335 million in the second quarter, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the Vainer settlement. And we now expect our 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion, again excluding the Vainer settlement. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below the range.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

And is there a model in which you've narrowed in on that's maybe more beneficial for you guys to pursue more aggressively?"

I think what we like most is investing in growth in our legacy markets, and that's consistent what we said we would like a couple of years ago, and we continue to like that. That's through organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions and things like that. Second, we really like buying quality medical groups or partnering in some serious capacity with major medical groups like we did in Colorado Springs, and -- as we are in a few conversations as we speak. So that's probably our second favorite option for growth. And then third and finally, we still have a lot of excitement around our payer joint venture in Philadelphia with IBC and for those in general and for our health system partnerships as we have with Centura in Colorado. But we continue to emphasize that, that is R&D. These are new types of arrangements and will take sometime to emerge. So we're positive on them. But at this point, if we had to rank the kind of risk adjusted, timing adjusted attractiveness of different segments of growth, we'd put good old legacy markets and partner with major medical groups at the top."

In the third quarter, we had solid strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first, as that is -- well, it comes first, we are first and foremost a caregiving company. We have about 177,000 patients in the U.S. now. It's about 35% of the total dialysis patients, and 97% of those patients had a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater. 73% of those patients officially place further access. 
For the second year in row, DaVita is a clinical leader in the CMS 5-star rating system. 46% of our centers are 4- or 5-star rated compared to 23% for all other providers, truly noteworthy.
HealthCare Partners. We continue to take care of over 800,000 patients on a globally capitated basis and several hundred thousand others on a fee-for-service basis. We'll give you another snippet of clinical information from healthcare partners using 2 -- using the 2014 HEDIS results. In Florida, 1 of our 3 legacy markets, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics. And we are 4- or 5-star across all MA patients on all 9 HEDIS metrics. That is outstanding.
These and other numbers, you see that the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HCP compare very favorably to national averages, healthier patients, healthier patient satisfaction, savings to taxpayers, that's the result.
Onto operating performance. In the HCP side, $83 million in OI. That number's a bit misleading in that it includes a net benefit of $22 million from the recognition of some risk-sharing settlements that we do not expect to recur. So it's real money that we earned, but it shouldn't have been centralized or concentrated in this particular quarter. But certainly, very good news. And even independent at a solid operating quarter. The big news in the HCP side, as many of you already know, is the announced combination of DaVita HealthCare Partners with the Everett Clinic. The Everett Clinic is one of the most respected multispecialty practices in America, with a strong primary care focus, more than 350 physicians currently, and we and they believe there is wonderful potential for highly robust growth in their market in the years to come. Already, they take care of over 300,000 patients. That's mostly fee-for-service today, but there's exceptionally strong interest in that geography by all parties to work with us and moving further down the value versus volume spectrum. We look to close in early 2016, and we're awfully excited. The balance of the business pipeline is strong. I'll leave it at that, unless people want to talk during Q&A.
On the Kidney Care side. Operating income on the other hand was adversely affected -- impacted, affected by a non-recurring incident. $23 million reserve for refunds related to prior reimbursements received by our DaVita RX pharmacy business. So we had a $22 million non-recurring pick up on one side, a $23 million non-recurring hit on the other side. So the net is the quarter is the quarter, but it's got those puts and takes. 
Our non-acquired, the balance of treatment growth was 3.5%. Usually Adam cover that. I'll covering at this time because it was the lowest in sometime. A lot of different causes. I'll just discuss a few them. We refer to some hospital contracting changes. As of the last quarter or 2, that continues to impact our numbers. We're also experiencing significant delays in some states where we are more concentrated than others due to delays in state certification and other regulatory issues. We have nearly doubled the number of de novos awaiting certification compared to the same time last year. And in addition so far this year, we're not picking up any tailwind in terms of treatment growth from decreasing mortality. Nonetheless, we still expect total treatment growth over the intermediate term to remain between 4.5% and 6%, as we previously discussed at our Capital Markets Day, although we could be a bit below this year. And we expect non-acquired growth to remain between 3% and 4.5%, although the near term is likely to be at the lower end of that. 
Overall 2015 guidance. Enterprise guidance is now $1.87 billion to $1.915 billion in Kidney Care, and we are raising the guidance just slightly. Operating income from $1.63 billion to $1.655 billion now. In HCP, we are tightening the range, an operating income expectation of $240 million to $260 million. We're not giving quantitative 2016 guidance at this time. We'll be doing that, that type of 2016 guidance on the Q4 call, but we do want to provide some directional guidance for both HealthCare Partners and for Kidney Care.
On the HCP side, we have 2 definite earnings headwinds and 1 potential earnings headwind. Number one is a definitive headwind in the form of reimbursement cuts. And these have been previously discussed for the most part. A net $50 million dip in MA reimbursement because of the completion of the 100% move to the new HCC model, which has been previously say disclosed and that number discussed. In addition, we expect about $20 million in Medicaid cuts, as the state of California adjusts to the data on the Medicaid expansion population that came in earlier in the program and them settling that out at this time.
The second earnings headwind is actually we intend to make good news for the long term, which is some significant infrastructure and next-generation investments on the HCP side. We're at the point now where we can execute on these kinds of strategic moves with more confidence. The biggest chunk of that is on the IT and technology side. Everything from improving the point-of-care information for our delivery system, significantly improving the depth and breath of our mobile applications, significantly enhancing website presence and features, both for internal and external use. And when we talk about external, we're talking about IPA physicians, we're talking about brokers, we're talking about patients. Significant improvement in our data mining capability in our clinical data warehouse. Improvements in patient scheduling, things like that. 
The second largest area of increased investment will be in compliance legal. One of the other large ones is in increased physician recruiting, as our growth potential continues to unfold. But the general title is a lot of infrastructure and next-generation investment. Now one would reasonably want to ask for a lot of rigorous discussion of any such investment. And at our Capital Markets Day, we will provide just that. We intend to do Capital Markets in the first half of the year. 
The third headwind is the potential headwind was the potential to nonrenewal of a pair of contract due to the fact that right now, the rate offer is unacceptable. We hope it doesn't happen, as it will cause significant patient and a player disruption, but it could. So that's a potential.
The good news to weigh against all those 2 real headwinds for next year and 1 potential headwind for next year is our expectation of continued strong performance in our legacy markets. If you look over the last 3 years, the growth in our MA population in those legacy markets has been 15% on a CAGR basis. And if you eliminate the MA rate reductions on the RAF model side on the ACC model side, then the CAGR of EBITDA growth in the last few years is approximately 4% or so. So without those headwinds, we would be looking at somewhere favorable numbers.
Nevertheless, when you put all that together the net is that 2016 OI in HCP is likely to be lower than 2015.
Stepping back from that 1 year fact, our investment thesis still stands. We have a strong and substantial foundation where we are good at doing at scale where others want to be good at, and we are working hard to enhance the team and value proposition as we move forward.
On the dialysis front, I think we can be quite concise that it would be a year with a typical puts and takes in terms of upsides and downsides, if not for the fact that our Medicare reimbursement will be nearly flat. And that's just a difficult headwind to overcome on that side, as so many of you know.
A few words on capital deployment. From an enterprise perspective, perhaps 3 points. Point #1, in the quarter, we did significant capital deployment with substantial acquisitions in both U.S. Kidney Care and healthcare partners. We also did significant share repurchases as our earnings press release reflected. 
The second part is we still have a healthy cash balance and continue to generate strong cash flows. 
And the third and final point is that we look forward of continuing to deploy that cash over the next several quarters in the same way that we deployed that capital in this past quarter, evaluating the relative opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Now I'll and hand it over to Jim Hilger, our Chief Financial Officer, will walk through some more details and some of the numbers."

This includes the increase in refund reserves recorded in Q3 at DaVita Rx. This improvement is driven primarily as a result of 2 main positive factors: One, an additional treatment day in the third quarter; and two, solid costs management of both patient care costs and G&A expense, with each down over $1 per treatment in the quarter as compared to Q2. International losses were $15 million in the quarter, and this is consistent with the last quarter. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.
Now onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the third quarter, which is good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $46 million. We expect noncontrolling interest to be slightly lower in Q4.
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the third quarter was 40.5%. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. Also we purchased $341 million of our common stock in the third quarter, which brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $425 million and 5.6 million shares. 
As you think about modeling the fourth quarter, here's a few things to keep in mind. Q4 is typically the weakest OI quarter of the year for HCP, and dialysis G&A tends to increase in the fourth quarter. Both of these are factored into our full 2015 operating income guidance.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $679 million in the quarter. We now expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. This range excludes the approximately $300 million after-tax impact of the Vainer settlement. Please note that the strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from the 2016 operating cash flows due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. 
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

But the certification and regulatory delays are very hard to predict, and particularly in places like California, where we have a lot of centers and a lot of centers waiting to be built into certified and/or occupied. We're really getting hurt. And if we were more adept in this area in terms of predicting, we would have told you over time that it was going to happen, and we didn't tell you ahead of time. And then on the mortality front, we've done so well the last 4 or 5, 6 years in a row, and this plateauing was not something we expected.

That is a small minority of the overall pool. A lot of other folks are acquiring practices and recruiting doctors where with 85% of the motivation being to just secure their referral flow and they are not making the tough decisions and tough investments associated with actually getting really good at that. And so for us, however, in either case, we look at it with a fresh set of eyes. Some hospitals and health systems are becoming great partners to us, and we will work with them to succeed in both population health management and fee-for-service at the same time. In other cases, we are, in fact, competing with hospitals as they seek to move down the path or just try to gain control of the referral flow.

And b, in many instances, they want step one is actually to add expense to start building the capability and start negotiating the contracts that are going to lead to the incremental value and the incremental profit. But it means you're adding expense or you're adding revenue with positive contribution margin and it takes time to get some of the contracts and execute. So while a number of those different investments we've made are right on plan, those plans are not going to contribute any significant incremental profit in 2016. In the cases like the Everett clinic, which has a long track record of strong operating performance, nonetheless, the growth opportunity is so substantial. We are eager with them to invest to go pursuit that growth opportunity when in the short term, that means a bunch of expense. So we understand that it's our responsibility to delineate this with pretty conceptual and analytical rigor at the Capital Markets Day. In the meantime, the net number is nothing to get excited about from our short-term profit point of view."

Point #1, we think good multispecialty groups can make significant contribution margins in a fee-for-service world, as Everett clinic and others have demonstrated. So we never want to confuse profitability as being only the result of having globally capitated contracts. That's our premise exactly the opposite is true, especially when we start partnering with a group and they have more access for the capital to do some of the things that are quite leveraged, even in the fee-for-service world. Second, that the -- one of the powerful levers to pull to enhance the value proposition and profitability of a major medical group is to actually sign some global risk contracts and begin to invest in eliminating waste in the system and improving health. And then third, there's all sorts of less dramatic value-based contracting that can go on in between with a shared savings and bonus plans and new market incentives and combined ancillaries. And so that the menu of intermediary steps that could be taken with plans in a market or with the health system or with other medical groups is quite long.

In the third quarter, we had solid strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first as that is what comes first. We are first",1527,"Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in our enterprise. In the third quarter, we had solid strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first as that is what comes first. We are first and foremost a caregiver company. We have about 177,000 patients in the U.S. now. That's about 35% of the total dialysis patients, and 97% of those patients had a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater. 73% of those patients have fistula placed for their access. 
For the second year in a row, DaVita is the clinical leader in the CMS 5-star rating system. 46% of our centers are 4- or 5-star rated compared to 23% for all other providers, truly noteworthy.
HealthCare Partners. We continue to take care of over 800,000 patients on a globally capitated basis and several hundred thousand others on a fee-for-service basis.
To give you another snippet of clinical information from HealthCare Partners using 2 -- using the 2014 HEDIS result. In Florida, 1 of our 3 legacy markets, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics. And we are 4- or 5-star across all MA patients on all 9 HEDIS metrics. That is outstanding.
These and other numbers, you see that clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HCP compare very favorably to national averages, healthier patients, healthier patient satisfaction, savings to taxpayers, that's the result.
On to operating performance. In the HCP side, $83 million in OI. That number's a bit misleading in that it includes a net benefit of $22 million from the recognition of some risk-sharing settlements that we do not expect to recur. So it's real money that we earned, but it shouldn't have been centralized or concentrated in this particular quarter. But certainly, very good news. And even independent of that, a solid operating quarter. But the big news in the HCP side, as many of you already know, is the announced combination of DaVita HealthCare Partners with The Everett Clinic. The Everett Clinic is one of the most respected multi-specialty practices in America, with a strong primary care focus, more than 350 physicians currently. And we and they believe there is wonderful potential for highly robust growth in their market in the years to come. Already, they take care of over 300,000 patients. That's mostly fee-for-service today, but there's exceptionally strong interest in that geography by all parties to work with us and moving further down the value-versus-volume spectrum. We look to close in early 2016, and we're awfully excited. The balance of the business pipeline is strong. I'll leave it at that, unless people want to talk during Q&A.
On the Kidney Care side. Operating income on the other hand was adversely impacted, affected by a nonrecurring incident, $23 million reserve for refunds related to prior reimbursements received by our DaVita RX pharmacy business. So we had a $22 million nonrecurring pickup on one side, a $23 million nonrecurring hit on the other side. So the net is the quarter is the quarter, but it's got those puts and takes.
Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.5%. Usually, I don't cover that. I'm covering it this time because it was the lowest in some time. A lot of different causes. I'll just discuss a few of them. We referred to some hospital contracting changes. As of the last quarter or 2, that continues to impact our numbers. We're also experiencing significant delays in some states where we are more concentrated than others due to delays in state certification and other regulatory issues. We have nearly doubled the number of de novos awaiting certification compared to the same time last year. And in addition, so far this year, we're not picking up any tailwind in terms of treatment growth from decreasing mortality. Nonetheless, we still expect total treatment growth over the intermediate term to remain between 4.5% and 6%, as we previously discussed at our Capital Markets Day, although we could be a bit below this year. And we expect non-acquired growth to remain between 3% and 4.5%,  although the near term is likely to be at the lower end of that. 
Overall 2015 guidance. Enterprise guidance is now $1.87 billion to $1.915 billion in Kidney Care, and we are raising the guidance just slightly, operating income from $1.63 billion to $1.655 billion now. In HCP, we are tightening the range, an operating income expectation of $240 million to $260 million. We're not giving quantitative 2016 guidance at this time. We'll be doing that, that type of 2016 guidance on the Q4 call, but we do want to provide some directional guidance for both HealthCare Partners and for Kidney Care.
On the HCP side, we have 2 definite earnings headwinds and 1 potential earnings headwind. Number one is a definitive headwind in the form of reimbursement cuts. And these have been previously discussed for the most part, a net $50 million hit in MA reimbursement because of the completion of the 100% move to the new HCC model, which has been previously disclosed and that number discussed.
In addition, we expect about $20 million in Medicaid cuts, as the state of California adjusts to the data on the Medicaid expansion population that came in earlier in the program and them settling that out at this time.
The second earnings headwind is actually we intend to make good news for the long term, which is some significant infrastructure and next-generation investments on the HCP side. We're at the point now where we can execute on these kinds of strategic moves with more confidence. The biggest chunk of that is on the IT and technology side, everything from improving the point-of-care information for our delivery system, significantly improving the depth and breadth of our mobile applications, significantly enhancing website presence and features both for internal and external use. And when we talk about external, we're talking about IPA physicians, we're talking about brokers, we're talking about patients. Significant improvement in our data-mining capability in our clinical data warehouse; improvements in patient scheduling, things like that. 
The second largest area of increased investment will be in compliance and legal. One of the other large ones is in increased physician recruiting, as our growth potential continues to unfold. But the general title is a lot of infrastructure and next-generation investment. Now one would reasonably want to ask for a lot of rigorous discussion of any such investment. And at our Capital Markets Day, we will provide just that. We intend to do Capital Markets in the first half of the year. 
The third headwind is the potential headwind was the potential of a nonrenewal of a pair of contract due to the fact that right now, the rate offer is unacceptable. We hope it doesn't happen, as it will cause significant patient and employer disruption, but it could. So that's a potential.
Now the good news to weigh against all those 2 real headwinds for next year and the 1 potential headwind for next year is our expectation of continued strong performance in our legacy markets. If you look over the last 3 years, the growth in our MA population in those legacy markets has been 15% on a CAGR basis. And if you eliminate the MA rate reductions on the RAF model side on the HCC model side, then the CAGR of EBITDA growth in the last few years is approximately 4% or so. So without those headwinds, we would be looking at some more favorable numbers.
Nevertheless, when you put all that together, the net is that 2016 OI in HCP is likely to be lower than 2015
Stepping back from that 1-year fact, our investment thesis still stands. We have a strong and substantial foundation where we are good at doing at scale where others want to be good at, and we are working hard to enhance the team and value proposition as we move forward.
On the dialysis front, I think we can be quite concise that it would be a year with a typical puts and takes in terms of upsides and downsides, if not for the fact that our Medicare reimbursement will be near flat. And that's just a difficult headwind to overcome on that side, as so many of you know.
A few words on capital deployment. From an enterprise perspective, perhaps 3 points. Point #1, in the quarter, we did significant capital deployment with substantial acquisitions in both U.S. Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners and we also did significant share repurchases, as our earnings press release reflected.
The second point is we still have a healthy cash balance and continue to generate strong cash flows. 
And the third and final point is that we look forward to continuing to deploy that cash over the next several quarters in the same way that we deployed that capital in this past quarter, evaluating the relative opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Now I hand it over to Jim Hilger, our Chief Financial Officer, who will walk through some more details and some of the numbers."

This includes the increase in refund reserves recorded in Q3 at DaVita Rx. This improvement is driven primarily as a result of 2 main positive factors: one, an additional treatment day in the third quarter; and two, solid cost management of both patient care costs and G&A expense, with each down over $1 per treatment in the quarter as compared to Q2. International losses were $15 million in the quarter, and this is consistent with the last quarter. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.
Now on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the third quarter, which is good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $46 million. We expect noncontrolling interest to be slightly lower in Q4.
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the third quarter was 40.5%. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. Also, we purchased $341 million of our common stock in the third quarter, which brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $425 million and 5.6 million shares.
As you think about modeling the fourth quarter, here's a few things to keep in mind: Q4 is typically the weakest OI quarter of the year for HCP, and dialysis G&A tends to increase in the fourth quarter. Both of these are factored into our full 2015 operating income guidance.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $679 million in the quarter. We now expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. This range excludes the approximately $300 million after-tax impact of the Vainer settlement. Please note that the strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from the 2016 operating cash flows due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

We're really getting hurt. And if we were more adept in this area in terms of predicting, we would have told ahead of time that it was going to happen. And clearly, we didn't tell you ahead of time. And then on the mortality front, we've done so well the last 4, 5, 6 years in a row. And this plateauing was not something we expected.

A lot of other folks are acquiring practices and recruiting doctors, where with 85% of the motivation being to just secure their referral flow. And they are not making the tough decisions and tough investments associated with actually getting very good at that. And so for us, however, in either case, we look at it with a fresh set of eyes. Some hospitals and health systems are becoming great partners to us, and we will work with them to succeed in both population health management and fee-for-service at the same time. In other cases, we are, in fact, competing with hospitals as they seek to move down the path or just try to gain control of their referral flows.

And b, in many instances, they -- step 1 is actually to add expense to start building the capability and start negotiating the contracts that are going to lead to the incremental value and the incremental profit. But it means you're adding expense before you're adding revenue with positive contribution margin, and it takes time to get some of the contracts and execute. So while a number of those different investments we've made are right on plan, those plans are not going to contribute any significant incremental profit in 2016. In the cases like The Everett Clinic, which has a long track record of strong operating performance, nonetheless, the growth opportunity is so substantial, we are eager with them to invest, to go pursue that growth opportunity when in the short term that means a bunch of expense. So we understand that it's our responsibility to delineate this with good conceptual and analytical rigor at the Capital Markets Day.

Point #1, we think good multi-specialty groups can make significant contribution margins in a fee-for-service world, as Everett Clinic and others have demonstrated. So we never want to confuse profitability as being only the result of having globally capitated contracts, that it's our premise. Exactly the opposite is true, especially when we start partnering with a group and they have more access for the capital to do some of the things that are quite leveraged, even in a fee-for-service world. Second, that the -- one of the powerful levers to pull to enhance the value proposition and profitability of a major medical group is to actually sign some global risk contracts and begin to invest in eliminating waste from the system and improving health. And then third, there's all sorts of less dramatic value-based contracting that can go on in between, whether it's shared savings and bonus plans and new market incentives and combined ancillaries. And so that the menu of intermediary steps that can be taken with plans in a market or with the health system or with other medical groups is quite long. And so with the Everett Clinic, we're excited because our 5-year strategy encompasses all 3 of those fulcrums."

In the third quarter, we had solid to strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first as that is what comes first. We are fir",1528,"Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in our enterprise. In the third quarter, we had solid to strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first as that is what comes first. We are first and foremost a caregiver company. We have about 177,000 patients in the U.S. now. That's about 35% of the total dialysis patients, and 97% of those patients had a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater. 73% of those patients have fistula placed for their access. 
For the second year in a row, DaVita is the clinical leader in the CMS 5-star rating system. 46% of our centers are 4- or 5-star rated compared to 23% for all other providers, truly noteworthy.
HealthCare Partners. We continue to take care of over 800,000 patients on a globally capitated basis and several hundred thousand others on a fee-for-service basis.
To give you another snippet of clinical information from HealthCare Partners using 2 -- using the 2014 HEDIS results. In Florida, 1 of our 3 legacy markets, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics. And we are 4- or 5-star across all MA patients on all 9 HEDIS metrics. That is outstanding.
These and other numbers, you see that clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HCP compare very favorably to national averages, healthier patients, healthier patient satisfaction, savings to taxpayers, that's the result.
On to operating performance. In the HCP side, $83 million in OI. That number's a bit misleading in that it includes a net benefit of $22 million from the recognition of some risk-sharing settlements that we do not expect to recur. So it's real money that we earned, but it shouldn't have been centralized or concentrated in this particular quarter. But certainly, very good news. And even independent of that, a solid operating quarter. But the big news in the HCP side, as many of you already know, is the announced combination of DaVita HealthCare Partners with The Everett Clinic. The Everett Clinic is one of the most respected multi-specialty practices in America, with a strong primary care focus, more than 350 physicians currently. And we and they believe there is wonderful potential for highly robust growth in their market in the years to come. Already, they take care of over 300,000 patients. That's mostly fee-for-service today, but there's exceptionally strong interest in that geography by all parties to work with us and moving further down the value-versus-volume spectrum. We look to close in early 2016, and we're awfully excited. The balance of the business pipeline is strong. I'll leave it at that, unless people want to talk during Q&A.
On the Kidney Care side. Operating income on the other hand was adversely impacted, affected by a nonrecurring incident, $23 million reserve for refunds related to prior reimbursements received by our DaVita RX pharmacy business. So we had a $22 million nonrecurring pickup on one side, a $23 million nonrecurring hit on the other side. So the net is the quarter is the quarter, but it's got those puts and takes.
Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.5%. Usually, I don't cover that. I'm covering it this time because it was the lowest in some time. A lot of different causes. I'll just discuss a few of them. We referred to some hospital contracting changes. As of the last quarter or 2, that continues to impact our numbers. We're also experiencing significant delays in some states where we are more concentrated than others due to delays in state certification and other regulatory issues. We have nearly doubled the number of de novos awaiting certification compared to the same time last year. And in addition, so far this year, we're not picking up any tailwind in terms of treatment growth from decreasing mortality. Nonetheless, we still expect total treatment growth over the intermediate term to remain between 4.5% and 6%, as we have previously discussed at our Capital Markets Day, although we could be a bit below this year. And we expect non-acquired growth to remain between 3% and 4.5%,  although the near term is likely to be at the lower end of that. 
Overall 2015 guidance. Enterprise guidance is now $1.87 billion to $1.915 billion in Kidney Care, and we are raising the guidance just slightly, operating income from $1.63 billion to $1.655 billion now. In HCP, we are tightening the range, an operating income expectation of $240 million to $260 million. We're not giving quantitative 2016 guidance at this time. We'll be doing that, that type of 2016 guidance on the Q4 call, but we do want to provide some directional guidance for both HealthCare Partners and for Kidney Care.
On the HCP side, we have 2 definite earnings headwinds and 1 potential earnings headwind. Number one is a definitive headwind in the form of reimbursement cuts. And these have been previously discussed for the most part, a net $50 million hit in MA reimbursement because of the completion of the 100% move to the new HCC model, which has been previously disclosed and that number discussed.
In addition, we expect about $20 million in Medicaid cuts, as the state of California adjusts to the data on the Medicaid expansion population that came in earlier in the program and them settling that out at this time.
The second earnings headwind is actually we intend to make good news for the long term, which is some significant infrastructure and next-generation investments on the HCP side. We're at the point now where we can execute on these kinds of strategic moves with more confidence. The biggest chunk of that is on the IT and technology side, everything from improving the point-of-care information for our delivery system, significantly improving the depth and breadth of our mobile applications, significantly enhancing website presence and features both for internal and external use. And when we talk about external, we're talking about IPA physicians, we're talking about brokers, we're talking about patients. Significant improvement in our data-mining capability in our clinical data warehouse; improvements in patient scheduling, things like that. 
The second largest area of increased investment will be in compliance and legal. One of the other large ones is in increased physician recruiting, as our growth potential continues to unfold. But the general title is a lot of infrastructure and next-generation investment. Now one would reasonably want to ask for a lot of rigorous discussion of any such investment. And at our Capital Markets Day, we will provide just that. We intend to do Capital Markets in the first half of the year. 
The third headwind is a potential headwind was the potential of a nonrenewal of a payer contract due to the fact that right now, the rate offer is unacceptable. We hope it doesn't happen, as it will cause significant patient and employer disruption, but it could. So that's a potential.
Now the good news to weigh against all those 2 real headwinds for next year and the 1 potential headwind for next year is our expectation of continued strong performance in our legacy markets. If you look over the last 3 years, the growth in our MA population in those legacy markets has been 15% on a CAGR basis. And if you eliminate the MA rate reductions on the RAF model side on the HCC model side, then the CAGR of EBITDA growth in the last few years is approximately 4% or so. So without those headwinds, we would be looking at some more favorable numbers.
Nevertheless, when you put all that together, the net is that 2016 OI in HCP is likely to be lower than 2015
Stepping back from that 1-year fact, our investment thesis still stands. We have a strong and substantial foundation where we are good at doing at scale what others want to be good at, and we are working hard to enhance the team and value proposition as we move forward.
On the dialysis front, I think we can be quite concise that it would be a year with a typical puts and takes in terms of upsides and downsides, if not for the fact that our Medicare reimbursement will be near flat. And that's just a difficult headwind to overcome on that side, as so many of you know.
A few words on capital deployment. From an enterprise perspective, perhaps 3 points. Point #1, in the quarter, we did significant capital deployment with substantial acquisitions in both U.S. Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners and we also did significant share repurchases, as our earnings press release reflected.
The second point is we still have a healthy cash balance and continue to generate strong cash flows. 
And the third and final point is that we look forward to continuing to deploy that cash over the next several quarters in the same way that we deployed that capital in this past quarter, evaluating the relative opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Now I hand it over to Jim Hilger, our Chief Financial Officer, who will walk through some more details and some of the numbers."

This includes the increase in refund reserves recorded in Q3 at DaVita Rx. This improvement is driven primarily as a result of 2 main positive factors: one, an additional treatment day in the third quarter; and two, solid cost management of both patient care costs and G&A expense, with each down over $1 per treatment in the quarter as compared to Q2. International losses were $15 million in the quarter, and this is consistent with the last quarter. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.
Now on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the third quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $46 million. We expect noncontrolling interest to be slightly lower in Q4.
Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the third quarter was 40.5%. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. Also, we purchased $341 million of our common stock in the third quarter, which brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $425 million and 5.6 million shares.
As you think about modeling the fourth quarter, here's a few things to keep in mind: Q4 is typically the weakest OI quarter of the year for HCP, and dialysis G&A tends to increase in the fourth quarter. Both of these are factored into our full 2015 operating income guidance.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $679 million in the quarter. We now expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. This range excludes the approximately $300 million after-tax impact of the Vainer settlement. Please note that the strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from the 2016 operating cash flows due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

We know as we've continued to prune our hospital portfolio that we'll put that behind us and then the year-over-year comparisons will start to be different than the way they look right now. But the certification and regulatory delays are very hard to predict, and particularly in places like California, where we have a lot of centers and a lot of centers waiting to be built into our certified and/or occupied. We're really getting hurt. And if we were more adept in this area in terms of predicting, we would have told ahead of time that it was going to happen. And clearly, we didn't tell you ahead of time. And then on the mortality front, we've done so well the last 4, 5, 6 years in a row. And this plateauing was not something we expected. And so we, at the same time or in the same way, are not good at saying what's going to happen over the next year to that trajectory.

A lot of other folks are acquiring practices and recruiting doctors, where with 85% of the motivation being to just secure their referral flow. And they are not making the tough decisions and tough investments associated with actually getting very good at that. And so for us, however, in either case, we look at it with a fresh set of eyes. Some hospitals and health systems are becoming great partners to us, and we will work with them to succeed in both population health management and fee-for-service at the same time. In other cases, we are, in fact, competing with hospitals as they seek to move down the path or just try to gain control of their referral flows.

I guess, I just wanted to get your interpretation of the provision in there to kind of include drugs more quickly into the bundled rate. I think there's been some hope that as EPO goes generic, there could be a little bit of period of time where you guys benefit from the lower-cost drug for a while. It seemed like what CMS was trying to do was trying to narrow that window. And so I just want to understand your interpretation of that. And then also if, in fact, Amgen will wait for a while to match one of the other drug that's currently out there starts to get used a little bit. Is that going to put you -- is that a headwind potentially into 2017, I guess?"

One, they have categories, which they have identified for when a drug or a service would be new and so how that would come into the bundle.

And then as -- they suggest that, that period be a minimum of 2 years. After such period, both that product as well as the oral equivalent will come in to the bundled payment system. They don't go through much more detail than that, a little bit more detail. So I'm sure we look forward to working with them over the next couple of years through the detailed implementation.

Second, that the -- one of the powerful levers to pull to enhance the value proposition and profitability of a major medical group is to actually sign some global risk contracts and begin to invest in eliminating waste from the system and improving health. And then third, there's all sorts of less dramatic value-based contracting that can go on in between, whether it's shared savings and bonus plans and new market incentives and combined ancillaries.
