I'll begin my comments today focusing on our performance both on the fourth quarter and for the full Year. I'll then discuss our current 2015 marke",1170,"Good morning. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With me today is Maryann Seaman, our CFO. I'll begin my comments today focusing on our performance both on the fourth quarter and for the full Year. I'll then discuss our current 2015 market outlook, Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance and our financial outlook for 2015. And then we'll open up the call for your questions.
2014 was a very successful year for FMC Technologies. We achieved record revenue and operating income in both our Subsea Technologies and our Surface Technologies segments. Company earnings were $0.72 per diluted share in the quarter and a record $2.72 for the year. This excludes the gain related to the sale of our Material Handling business and represents a 30% decrease over our prior year performance.
Maryann will provide further detail on 2 items that impacted our earnings. Company revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion taking our full year total to $7.9 million, an 11% increase from 2013. In Subsea, we successfully executed a significant backlog, our focus on execution that began 4 years ago has greatly improve our ability to perform well at a much higher activity level. Subsea revenue for example is almost double over the same 4-year period.
We've also benefited from the growth of our Subsea Service business. The strategic focus business service has resulted in the development of a sustainable source of growth while raising our margin profile. Again, our focus on execution delivered solid fourth quarter Subsea margins at 14.5% and our full year margin average 14.2%, a 260 basis point improvement from last year. 
Fourth quarter subsea orders totaled $1.7 billion, bringing our full year total to $5.5 billion. This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year. The total includes our announced awards from the Chevron project in Nigeria, the NI 1506 award in Angola and the Winter Shaw Maria project in Norway. Just as significant, our margins and backlog increased again in the quarter. 
Surface Technologies fourth quarter revenue was $584 million driven by the strength of our international surface wellhead business in our North American fluid control business. Our international wellhead business continued to develop exceptional results. We've established a significant margin presence in the Middle East, that's enabled us maintain a solid backlog while continuing to move our margins. 
Our North America fluid control sales activity was strong for the quarter as order activity held up until December. Overall, our quarterly segment margins of almost 20% are the highest we delivered 2014. 
Turning to 2015. We're responding to the slowdown in our industry as a result of the severe declines in oil prices. We will leverage the momentum of our execution improvements and the strong year end backlog in Subsea at Surface international. We are responded quickly and significantly to the slowdown in our North America businesses by reducing discretionary and capital spending. Most impactful, we have begun the process of reducing headcount company-wide by approximately 10%. The most significant reductions will come from North America where rapid productivity declines are occurring in this short cycle market. We are also using this as an opportunity to strengthen our subsea customer. The improvement process estimated our Subsea business have not only improved our quality and on-time performance, but they've improved our efficiency. These efficiency gains positioned us to deliver a level of activity in 2015 comparable to 2014, but with the smaller, leaner subsea organization. Again, we expect to leverage our execution momentum and strong backlog to not only successfully manage through the downturn, but emerge stronger in the recovery.
Regarding our outlook for subsea orders, we do not expect our 2015 subsea orders to be as strong as 2014. As we previously discussed, many of the larger awards we have expected this year are in Africa. Historically, these audits involve national oil company can have a greater propensity for delay. And in today's current environment, the risk of project delay is greater. Although subsea projects are proceeding, including the awards we received in the fourth quarter, most operators are reassessing their project portfolio looking for ways to achieve significant cost reductions. This is a process that began last year before energy prices began falling and the importance has now become much greater. FMC Technologies has been and continues to be active and directly involved in the reevaluation of projects, particularly with our partners. As a partner, we're proactive in proposing alternative approaches to Project development that includes adopting cost-effective FMC standards, early acceptance of new technologies and different business models that reduce the total cost of development. 
An example of our success in standardization is a 20,000 PSI 350-degree for subsea equipment accepted by a multi-operator consortium. Our investment in the knowledge he focus on the production system, over a step change in savings on equipment costs. Through our unique partnerships, we have the ability to be involved early in design concepts that can optimize the full field development costs. And in today's environment, operators are much more open to different approaches that can result in significant reduction to their development costs.
Shifting now to Surface Technologies. We're now experiencing the effect of the significant slowing in the North America land market. U.S. rig count is falling by almost 500 rigs since the middle of November. We anticipate this decline continuing over the coming months as oil and gas prices have fallen past levels than supposed most current activities. We're now taking actions to address the reduced volumes we experienced in 2015 and we're confident these steps will allow us to effectively manage through the downturn while at the same time not sacrificing our ability to adjust when the cyclical market recovers.
Our North America Surface Technologies activity should remain -- I'm sorry, our non-North American surface technologies activity should remain healthy in 2015. We continue to grow our market position internationally, most predominantly in the Middle East, and expect that backlog that we built will help us minting revenue levels similar to 2014. Customer activity outside North America is typically more resilient through market cycles, but we're prepared to take action should we see markets often beyond the current expectations. 
In conclusion, the performance in 2014 delivered record results, but it also established positive execution momentum that will enable us to successfully overcome the challenges in the current market. We're taking early and meaningful action to stay ahead of the decline in activity. Deepwater and shale remain an important source for oil over future decades and as a result, continue to be an important part of operators' portfolio. To develop these assets requires forward thinking approaches and FMC Technologies is proactively engage with our partners working on new ways to successfully reduce development costs and improve project returns. 
Maryann will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2015 expectations."
972117,275030837,759474,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Included in the quarterly results is $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share of foreign currency losses due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter operational",1183,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Included in the quarterly results is $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share of foreign currency losses due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter operational performance was strong across all of our 3 segments. Subsea revenue was $1.4 with operating margins of 14.5%. Surface Technologies revenue was $585 million with operating margins of 19.9%. And Energy Infrastructure revenue was $138 million with the operating margins of 9.9%. Other revenue and expenses included $25 million or $0.07 per diluted share of costs associated with actions taking to derisk our defined benefit plan. These actions were reported. Let me the provide further detail on the segment results.
Subsea Technologies operating profit was $208 million in the fourth quarter. Operating profit improved 12% year-over-year when excluding the $23 million of recognized revenue and operating profit associated with an adjustment for withholding taxes included in our 2013 result. The improving margin profile of our backlog along with the efficiencies gained from the actions we have taken to improve operational performance played a significant role in our full year margin performance. Additionally, we have benefited from the continued growth of our subsea services capability. 
Subsea inbound in 2014 was $5.5 billion and provides a solid base for 2015 revenue and profit. Surface Technologies generated fourth quarter operating profit of $116 million as both our fully controlled and surface wellhead businesses activity levels remained strong throughout period the fourth quarter. Surface wellhead sales for both the fourth quarter and full year represents new record. Fluid Control, both fourth quarter operating income and margins, were strong and sales remained at high levels through the majority of the quarter. However, completion services fourth quarter sales activity was flat sequentially and operating income was down due to disappointing activity in the Canadian market. Orders for Surface Technologies for the quarter were $498 million. Orders for international wellhead continue to remain at strong level, but order activity began slowing for both North America Fluid Control and Surface wellhead. Backlog now stands at $654 million for this segment.  Energy Infrastructure generated fourth quarter operating profit of $13.7 million. 
Now for the Corporate item. Corporate expense in the quarter was $18.5 million. Other income and expense reflects expense of $46.9 million. This includes the previously discussed charge of $24.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of costs associated with actions taken to derisk our defined benefit pension plan. This also includes foreign exchange losses of $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share to the deferred strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Capital spending this quarter was $121 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies infrastructure and service investment. For the full year, our capital spending was $404 million. We repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.79 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average cost of $51.01. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $670 million. It was comprised of $639 million of cash and $1.3 million of debt. 
Looking at 2015. We have reasonably good visibility of revenues and operating profit for our Subsea business given the backlog of $5.8 billion. In Subsea Technologies, we expect full year revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. This estimate reflects a few changes in assumptions from earlier estimate. A strong in U.S. dollar impacting 2015 projection by approximately $300 million. A reduced amount of book revenue given a lower 2015 inbound expectation and a flattish year-over-year service activity. With the current margins in our backlog and the level of execution we expect to continue delivering, we are confident in our ability to attain average Subsea margins for the full year of approximately 15%. 
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. While difficult to project given the current pace of rigs coming out of the U.S. market, our Surface Technologies revenue will fall from 2014 level. With our large international backlog and our strengthened market position, we expect to have another strong year in International Surface wellhead with performance similar to 2014. 
For our North American business, we are currently assuming a U.S. rig count reduction between 700 to 800 rigs from last year's peak. At this level, we would expect Surface Technologies segment revenue to fall between 15% and 20%. If fully control, we are seeing reduced activity and therefore, expect volume to decline sequentially in the first quarter with continued weakening in subsequent quarters given the recent slowdown in orders due to reduced activity level. 
Activity level from surface wellhead North America and Completion Services will follow similar patterns. Headcount reductions commensurate with current inbound volumes have been completed and additional plans are in place to further reduce headcount in response to continued weakening in the market. We will take actions as appropriate for order inbound level to protect operating margin. 
Full year margin estimates in Surface Technology, we expect to be down between 400 and 450 basis points from our 2014 average count fall by 700 to 800 rigs. In Energy Infrastructure, we should see increased revenue in 2015 with margins in the low double digits on higher activity levels in our loading systems and Measurement Solutions businesses. In addition to the restructuring John and I discussed relating to the Subsea and Surface technology, we are actively renegotiating supplier contracts across all of our businesses to lower input costs. 
Regarding corporate items. We expect corporate expense to average approximately $15 million per quarter in 2015. Other expense net should average of $15 million per quarter in 2015 subject to foreign currency fluctuation. We expect our interest expense to average $8 million per quarter. We anticipate our 2014 tax rate to range between 30% and 32% for the full year. We expect capital spending in 2015 to be approximately $300 million, the majority of our 2015 nonmaintenance capital spending would be directed the with profit in services and investment. 
In conclusion, our Subsea performance should continue to be strong as we execute our backlog and generate service revenue at a level consistent with 2014. Operating margins in Subsea Technologies should increased approximately 15% in 2015, resulting in flat year-over-year operating profit. Our Subsea Technologies businesses will be challenged in North America but with a strong international presence, we think we can deliver revenue between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. We are forecasting our International Surface Wellhead business to remain at level consistent with 2014. The North America business will, however, experience significant year-over-year decline. Overall, the segment will see operating profit decline at least 30% from 2014 based on our stated range of U.S. rig reduction. 
Corporate cost should be relatively flat to 2014 and net expenses would be lower a certain cost incurred in 2014 will not repeat. Overall, we expect to deliver solid financial performance from our non-North America land businesses. We will make the structural changes necessary to minimize short-term margin impact while protecting look at them growth strategies.

But let me descri",592,"Ole, first of all, you can appreciate that we are engaged with all of our customers, particularly our partner relationships, I don't think there's a single one where we haven't had exactly the kind of conversation that you're discussing. But let me describe the nature of them. First of all, we believe our Subsea backlog is very secure. There have been a conversations about delaying deliveries, no cancellations, nothing of the nature. The conversations are very direct, given -- and I remember some of these conversations I talked about in the last quarter have been going on for over a year and that's the decline in returns for E&P companies for several years, the huge consent our customers, that's now heightened and those conversation are more intense with the change in oil price. Our customers are telling us that they need to make a step change in the development cost of their deepwater portfolio. They realized, a lot of surprising pressure, they realize they can't get there just by talking about price discounts and so forth. We need to be talking about something more substantial, which means we've got to start working in the difficult industry as a whole, needs to start working differently. The conversation center around standardization. As you know, our company has been particularly successful in driving FMC standards for our partners, most notably In the achievement last year of getting 4 operators to agree on a single spec for next-generation high-pressure high-temperature equipment. I think the acceptance of standards by our customers are now greater than it's ever been as a result of their determination to drive down costs and we think we're in a terrific position to offer the kinds of low cost efficient standard designs that they're going to do to improve their returns. 
The second thing we're talking about is with the operators, is a faster adoption of the technology, particularly new technology that makes step change in the cost of the hardware and the entire production system. FMC has been proposing for some time a unique technologies that directly lower the costs of their production system. And we're getting a lot -- not only does a lot of interest but I think real commitment to proceed with these new technologies, which will make a step change. And then finally, particularly with our partners, there's a recognition that something has to change. This can't be incremental, we can't just roll up our sleeves and work harder and shave things around the edge. We've got to do something substantially different if we're going to expect a significant change in the development cost and there's a real recognition that some of our business but also going to have to change. We're going to have to think a little bit differently about the entire scope of the development, not just individual components and how they're integrated and fit together. We've demonstrated to these partners that there are compelling cost reductions for the entire system if we'll change the way we approach the development of these projects. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, it absolutely is going to require that our company, the contractor, participate very early in the initial designs and concepts that the operators are using. Because of the many partnerships we have, we're uniquely positioned to participate early and the operators that we talk to are now, really for the first time, encouraging us and encouraging their organizations to let us participate early so we can we really deliver the step change the industry needs."

We know there's going to be some pricing pressure, we know that everybody needs to sharpen their pencil.

A quarter ago, I talked about a long list of projects. That long list of projects, it still exists. Projects haven't been completely shelved, project teams haven't been asked to stand out. They're still being worked. Some of these projects are proceeding and you saw that in our fourth quarter inbound. There were 3 projects. 1 or 2 of them, really we were expecting to happen in 2015 and they got accelerated in 2014. There are other projects, even some in West Africa like Bonga, that appear to be proceeding. But we should expect that virtually all the projects on this extensive list that we originally thought would be inbound in 2015 are going to be reevaluated. The pace of that reevaluation, it's unknown. I mean they're all going to be reevaluated. I think based on the operators intent to try to improve their economics, I'd like to think that most of them are going to go forward. But the timing of that evaluation means that some orders are going to still in 2015, but others are going to end up in 2016, as each of the operators go through this valuation process. So to answer more specific question, yes, it's possible that Bonga continues to proceed at the pace we've been watching it and get it or did in 2015. But it's also like the other projects that have been proceeding along a are going to go through a reevaluation process and if that evaluation process takes longer, those projects are very well move from '15 into '16."

Keep in mind, part of that conversion rate has to do with the size of the backlog and the makeup of the backlog. The greatest component of our backlog right now is actually Petrobras and as you know that Petrobras business has a longer tail. So in part about the conversion for this year, we are actually seeing a little bit of a slowing coming out of Petrobras. What was initially going to be in 2015 have asked us not to shift a small portion of that into 2016. So no overall change in the total, but rather a shifting from 15 into 16.1. You've talked about the FX conversion. That $300 million that I've talked about really had to do with looking at the average rates in 2014 to 2015. So that $300 million is really off of what our previous estimates. And then our Subsea Service  business, we're expecting it to be a little bit slower. One of our customers, largely in the North Sea, has expressed some OpEx slowing and we're seeing some slowing of that as well. The one into '16, as you say, obviously, it would depend on the timing and the size of 2014 and if we can get, depending on the timing of when that order comes in, we certainly can't see revenues in Subsea in 2016. Again, depending on the timing of that inbound to be flattish with 2015. If we are fortunate enough to see toward the back half of the year, as John talked about, although the reworking of those projects come to fruition, then there's certainly is an opportunity to see growth in that 2016 subsea revenue number."

So I mean -- as an example, but it gives you -- it sort of illustrates do urgency in which the operators realize they have to rework these projects. So this isn't about years.

But we're quite confident that once the vessel and the stack are available, which will happen in second quarter, that we'll be signing contracts. That system is very compelling to the operators and based on their reaction to that system entering the Gulf of Mexico. We're confident that will continue to revenue -- service revenue growth in 2015. And then nonservice, but our partners as you suggested that we do have a very strong market position, mostly driven by our partners in the Gulf of Mexico. With the Gulf of Mexico's large existing infrastructure, it's common for there to be smaller project towards satellite was step outs. Now, they will come under the same scrutiny as a large project with regard to improving return but probably not as intense and we're hopeful that the smaller project of the Gulf of Mexico will in fact, materialize in 2015. They tend to be a little shorter cycle in terms of the awards and therefore, and probably will be able to be even go through a reevaluation process, will probably be a little bit faster than pick the multibillion dollar project.

I'm sure Halliburton makes their own well service pump, but most of their treating iron the product line, it's bought from FMC and has been for a decade. So Halliburton remains an important customer of FMC. BJ Service before they were acquired by Baker Hughes was an important seller to FMC as well. Again, we're selling them treating iron, swivel joints, product line. But we also have road with Baker Hughes in terms of our well service pump. But remember the well service pump is a small part, we were relatively new to the industry in the well service pump. So it's not a big portion of our business. That's going to be Halliburton's decision how they integrate Baker  Hughes and Halliburton and what they do in terms of rationalizing the equipment that they use. But on the primary product, the fluid control, the flow line, we sold to both companies. So I think the way we look at is there may be some down side just on the consolidation of the 2 companies but there could very well be upside. Going forward, when we get to a recovery, our Fluid Control business recognize any importance of improving efficiency and developing shale, the developing products and services to do just that and I think Fluid Control will continue to contribute to successful development of shale and improving the cost efficiencies as they contributed to the industry. So I think they'll be part of the change that has to take place in shale to improve efficiency."

I think it makes a lot of sense to look back at the last downturn and it serves as an example of what we can expect. So I would say Curt, particularly on those projects that are tendered, this will be outside of our partnerships, we're going to see competitive pressures that will drive the pricing down and I think it will look a lot like we experienced in 2009, 2010. I think some of the differences, to compare and contrast, I think we have more partnerships today, more alliances, more frame agreements today than we did in 2008 and 2009. And it's in the context of those partnerships, not in the pricing concessions of the partnerships, but the nature is very different because those projects aren't tendered so we get to negotiate any changes in the pricing structure and it has -- that has a real effect on margins, a positive one, I would say, in the context negotiating with partner. So we have more partnerships going into this. I would say our relationships with our key customers is also stronger because of our execution performance and that's helpful when you're going into a downturn and negotiate prices. And then finally, our own performance. You will remember, I think you remember in 2010 and 2011, we were struggling with growth and that have an impact on our ability to execute, had an impact on our cost. Remember, we have a lot of people, brand-new people, that weren't as efficient. We go into this downturn very differently than we did in 2009 and 2010. Our execution performance has never been better. Our relationship with our customers has never been better and the maturity of the investments that we made in those 2009, 2010 is very different. Those new employees that we brought on in 2010 and 2011 now have 3 and 4 years of experience behind them. Their efficiency levels are much higher than they were when we went through that last downturn. The investments we made in processes and capacity, those are all behind us now. We are operating successfully, performing well, had an activity level that's almost double of what we were 4 years ago. And that's going to matter in terms of our net earnings because our execution is going to be better, our cost base is going to be -- structure is going to be better. So we go, although 2008 and 2009, what we learned from that downturn, I think will be an example of what we're going to experience this time, we go into this downturn very differently."

Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With me today is Maryann Seaman, our CFO. I'll begin my comments today focusing on our performance both on the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'll then discuss our current 2015 mar",1179,"Good morning. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With me today is Maryann Seaman, our CFO. 
I'll begin my comments today focusing on our performance both on the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'll then discuss our current 2015 market outlook, Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance and our financial outlook for 2015. And then we'll open up the call for your questions.
2014 was a very successful year for FMC Technologies. We achieved record revenue and operating income in both our Subsea Technologies and our Surface Technologies segments. Company earnings were $0.72 per diluted share for the quarter and a record $2.72 for the year. This excludes the gain related to the sale of our Material Handling business and represents a 30% increase over our prior year performance.
Maryann will provide further detail on 2 items that impacted our earnings. Company revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, taking our full year total to $7.9 billion, an 11% increase from 2013. In Subsea, we successfully executed our significant backlog, our focus on execution that began 4 years ago has greatly improve our ability to perform well at a much higher activity level. Subsea revenue for example is almost double over the same 4-year period.
We've also benefited from the growth of our Subsea Service business. The strategic focus we placed on service has resulted in the development of a sustainable source of growth while raising our margin profile. Again, our focus on execution delivered solid fourth quarter Subsea margins at 14.5% and our full year margins average 14.2%, a 260 basis point improvement from last year. 
Fourth quarter subsea orders totaled $1.7 billion, bringing our full year total to $5.5 billion. This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year. The total includes our announced awards from the Chevron Agbami project in Nigeria, the ENI 15/06 award in Angola and the Wintershall's Maria project in Norway. Just as significant, our margins and backlog increased again in the quarter. 
Surface Technologies' fourth quarter revenue was $584 million driven by the strength of our international surface wellhead business in our North American fluid control business. Our international wellhead business continued to develop exceptional results. We've established a significant market presence in the Middle East that's enabled us maintain a solid backlog while continuing to improve our margins. 
Our North America fluid control sales activity was strong for the quarter as order activity held up until December. Overall, our quarterly segment margins of almost 20% are the highest we've delivered 2014. 
Turning to 2015. We're responding to the slowdown in our industry as a result of the severe declines in oil prices. We will leverage the momentum of our execution improvements and the strong year end backlog from Subsea at Surface international. We're responding quickly and significantly to the slowdown in our North America businesses by reducing discretionary and capital spending. Most impactful, we have begun the process of reducing headcount company-wide by approximately 10%. The most significant reductions will come from North America, where rapid activity declines are occurring in this short-cycle market. We are also using this as an opportunity to strengthen our subsea cost position. The improvements to processes we made in our Subsea business have not only improved our quality and on-time performance, but they've improved our efficiency. These efficiency gains positioned us to deliver a level of activity in 2015 comparable to 2014, but with a smaller, leaner subsea organization. Again, we expect to leverage our execution momentum and strong backlog to not only successfully manage through the downturn, but emerge stronger in the recovery.
Regarding our outlook for subsea orders, we do not expect our 2015 subsea orders to be as strong as 2014. As we previously discussed, many of the larger awards we have -- I had expected this year are in Africa. Historically, these awards involve national oil companies and have a greater propensity for delay. And in today's current environment, the risk of project delay is now greater. Although Subsea projects are proceeding, including the awards we received in the fourth quarter, most operators are reassessing their project portfolios, looking for ways to achieve significant cost reductions. This is a process that began last year before energy prices began falling, and the importance has now become much greater. 
FMC Technologies has been and continues to be active and directly involved in the reevaluation of projects, particularly with our partners. As a partner, we're proactive in proposing alternative approaches to project development that includes adopting cost-effective FMC standards, early acceptance of new technologies and different business models that reduce the total cost of development.  An example of our success in standardization is the 20,000 PSI 350-degrees standard specification for subsea equipment accepted by a multi-operator consortium. Our investments in technology, focused on the production system, offer a step change in savings on equipment cost. Through our unique partnerships, we have the ability to be involved early in design concepts that can optimize the full field development cost. And in today's environment, operators are much more open to different approaches that can result in significant reduction to their development cost. 
Shifting now to Surface Technologies, we're now experiencing the effect of the significant slowing in the North America land market. U.S. rig count has fallen by almost 500 rigs since the middle of November. We anticipate this decline continuing over the coming months as oil and gas prices have fallen past levels that suppose most current activity. We're now taking actions to address the reduced volumes we will experience in 2015 and we're confident these steps will allow us to effectively manage through the downturn, while at the same time, not sacrificing our ability to adjust when the cyclical market recovers.
Our North America Surface Technologies activity should remain -- I'm sorry, our non-North American Surface Technologies activity should remain healthy in 2015. We've continued to grow our market position internationally, most predominantly in the Middle East, and expect that backlog that we built will help us maintain revenue levels similar to 2014. Customer activity outside North America is typically more resilient through market cycles, but we're prepared to take action should we see markets soften beyond the current expectations. 
In conclusion, the performance in 2014 delivered record results, but it also established positive execution momentum that will enable us to successfully overcome the challenges in the current market. We're taking early and meaningful action to stay ahead of the decline in activity. 
Deepwater and shale remain an important source for oil over future decades, and as a result, continue to be an important part of operators' portfolios. To develop these assets requires forward thinking approaches, and FMC Technologies is proactively engaged with our partners, working on new ways to successfully reduce development cost and improve project returns. 
Maryann will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2015 expectations."
972117,275030837,759853,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Included in the quarterly results is $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share of foreign currency losses due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter operational",1189,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Included in the quarterly results is $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share of foreign currency losses due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter operational performance was strong across all of our 3 segments. Subsea revenue was $1.4 with operating margins of 14.5%. Surface Technologies revenue was $584 million with operating margins of 19.9%. And Energy Infrastructure revenue was $138 million with the operating margins of 9.9%. Other revenue and expenses included $25 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, of costs associated with actions taking to de-risk our defined benefit plan. These actions were reported. Let me provide further detail on the segment results.
Subsea Technologies operating profit was $208 million in the fourth quarter. Operating profit improved 12% year-over-year when excluding the $23 million of recognized revenue and operating profit associated with an adjustment for Angolan withholding taxes included in our 2013 results. The improving margin profile of our backlog, along with the efficiencies gained from the actions we have taken to improve operational performance, played a significant role in our full year margin performance. Additionally, we have benefited from the continued growth of our subsea services capability. 
Subsea inbound in 2014 was $5.5 billion and provides a solid base for 2015 revenue and profit. Surface Technologies generated fourth quarter operating profit of $116 million as both our fluid control and surface wellhead businesses activity levels remained strong throughout most of the fourth quarter. Surface wellhead sales for both the fourth quarter and full year represents new record. 
Fluid control fourth quarter operating income and margins were strong, and sales remained at high levels through the majority of the quarter. However, completion services fourth quarter sales activity was flat sequentially and operating income was down due to disappointing activity in the Canadian market. 
Orders for Surface Technologies for the quarter were $498 million. Orders for international wellhead continued to remain at strong level, but order activity began slowing for both North America fluid control and surface wellhead. Backlog now stands at $654 million for this segment.  
Energy Infrastructure generated fourth quarter operating profit of $13.7 million. 
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $18.5 million. Other income and expense net reflects expense of $46.9 million. This includes the previously discussed charge of $24.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of costs associated with actions taken to de-risk our defined benefit pension plan. This also includes foreign exchange losses of $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share to the deferred strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Capital spending this quarter was $121 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies infrastructure and service asset investments. For the full year, our capital spending was $404 million. We repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.79 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average cost of $51.01. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $670 million. It was comprised of $639 million of cash and $1.3 million of debt. 
Looking at 2015. We have reasonably good visibility of revenues and operating profit for our Subsea business given the backlog of $3 billion. In Subsea Technologies, we expect full year revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. This estimate reflects a few changes in assumptions from earlier estimates: A strong U.S. dollar impacting 2015 projection by approximately $300 million, a reduced amount of book in turn revenue given a lower 2015 inbound expectation and a flattish year-over-year service activity. With the current margins in our backlog and the level of execution we expect to continue delivering, we are confident in our ability to attain average Subsea margins for the full year of approximately 15%. 
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. While difficult to project given the current pace of rigs coming out of the U.S. market, our Surface Technologies revenue will fall from 2014 levels. With our large international backlog and our strength in market position, we expect to have another strong year in international surface wellhead with performance similar to 2014. 
For our North American business, we are currently assuming a U.S. rig count reduction between 700 to 800 rigs from last year's peak. At this level, we would expect Surface Technologies segment revenue to fall between 15% and 20%. In fluid control, we are seeing reduced activity, and therefore, expect volumes to decline sequentially in the first quarter, with continued weakening in subsequent quarters given the recent slowdown in orders due to reduced activity levels. 
Activity levels in surface wellhead in North America and completion services will follow similar patterns. Headcount reductions commensurate with current inbound volumes have been completed and additional plans are in place to further reduce headcount in response to continued weakening in the market. We will take actions as appropriate for order inbound levels to protect operating margins. 
Full year margin estimates in Surface Technology, we expect to be down between 400 and 450 basis points from our 2014 average if rig counts fall by 700 to 800 rigs. In Energy Infrastructure, we should see increased revenue in 2015 with margins in the low-double digits on higher activity levels in our loading systems and measurement solutions businesses. In addition to the restructuring John and I discussed relating to the Subsea and Surface Technologies, we are actively renegotiating supplier contracts across all of our businesses to lower input costs.
Regarding corporate items, we expect corporate expense to average approximately $15 million per quarter in 2015. Other expense net should average of $15 million per quarter in 2015, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We expect our interest expense to average $8 million per quarter. We anticipate our 2014 tax rate to range between 30% and 32% for the full year. We expect capital spending in 2015 to be approximately $300 million, the majority of our 2015 nonmaintenance capital spending will be directed towards profit adding subsea services and investments. 
In conclusion, our Subsea performance should continue to be strong as we execute our backlog and generate service revenue at a level consistent with 2014. Operating margins in Subsea Technologies should increase to approximately 15% in 2015, resulting in flat year-over-year operating profit. Our Subsea Technologies businesses will be challenged in North America, but with a strong international presence, we think we can deliver revenue between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. We are forecasting our international surface wellhead business to remain at levels consistent with 2014. The North America business will, however, experience significant year-over-year decline. Overall, the segment will see operating profits decline at least 30% from 2014, based on our stated range of U.S. rig count reductions. 
Corporate costs should be relatively flat to 2014 and net expenses will be lower as certain costs incurred in 2014 will not repeat. Overall, we expect to deliver solid financial performance from our non-North America land businesses. We will make the structural changes necessary to minimize short-term margin impact while protecting longer-term growth strategies.

I don't think there's a single one where we haven't had exactly the kind of conversations that you're discussing. But let me descr",603,"Ole, first of all, you can appreciate that we are engaged with all of our customers, particularly our partner relationships. I don't think there's a single one where we haven't had exactly the kind of conversations that you're discussing. But let me describe the nature of them. First of all, our -- we believe our Subsea backlog is very secure. There have been no conversations about delaying deliveries, no cancellations, nothing of the nature. The conversations are very direct, given the -- and remember, some of these conversations I talked about in the last quarter have been going on for over a year, and that's the declining returns for E&P companies for several years is a huge concern to our customers. That's now heightened and those conversation are more intense, with the change in oil price. Our customers are telling us that they need to make a step change in the development cost of their deepwater portfolio. They realized -- our customers realized, oh, there's lots of pricing pressure. They realize they can't get there just by talking about price discounts and so forth. We need to be talking about something more substantial, which means we've got to start working with the industry as a whole, we need to start working differently. The conversations center around standardization. As you know, our company has been particularly successful in driving FMC standards for our partners, most notably in the achievement last year of getting 4 operators to agree on a single spec for next-generation high-pressure, high-temperature equipment. I think the acceptance of standards by our customers are now greater than it's ever been as a result of their determination to drive down costs, and we think we're in a terrific position to offer the kinds of low cost, efficient, standard designs that they're going to do to improve their returns.  The second thing we're talking about is, with the operators, is a faster adoption of new technology, particularly new technology that makes a step change in the cost of the hardware and the entire production system. FMC has been proposing for some time unique technologies that directly lower the cost of their production systems. And we're getting a lot -- not only just a lot of interest, but I think real commitment to proceed with these new technologies, which will make a step change. And then finally, particularly with our partners, there's a recognition that something has to change. This can't be incremental. We can't just roll up our sleeves and work harder and shave things around the edge. We've got to do something substantially different if we're going to expect a significant change in the development cost, and there's a real recognition that some of our business models are going to have to change. We're going to have to think a little bit differently about the entire scope of the development, not just the individual components, and how they're integrated and fit together. We've demonstrated to these partners that there are compelling cost reductions for the entire system if we'll change the way we approach the development of these projects. It -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, it absolutely is going to require that our company, the contractor, participate very early in the initial designs and concepts that the operators are using. Because of the many partnerships we have, we're uniquely positioned to participate early, and the operators that we've talked to are now, really, for the first time, encouraging us and encouraging their organizations to let us participate early so we can really deliver the step change the industry needs."

And I think they recognize that if the kind of traditional, we're in a down cycle, let's squeeze cost, you can't get there. And so there's no -- I mean, we need to talk about that. We know there's going to be some pricing pressure. We know everybody needs to sharpen their pencil. But if the conversation isn't more than that, they know they won't be able to improve the returns and that's what gives me confidence that the operators are likely to adopt at a faster pace some of the alternative approaches that we're proposing.

There were 3 projects, 1 or 2 of them, really, we were expecting to happen in 2015, and they got accelerated into 2014. There are other projects, even some in West Africa like Bonga, that appear to be proceeding. But we should expect that virtually all the projects on this extensive list that we originally thought would be inbound in 2015 are going to be reevaluated. The pace of that reevaluation, it's unknown. I mean, they're all going to be reevaluated. I think based on the operator's intent to try to improve their economics, I'd like to think that most of them are going to go forward. But the timing of that reevaluation means that some orders are going to still land in 2015, but others are going to end up in 2016, as each of the operators go through this valuation process. So to answer your more specific question, yes, it's possible that Bonga continues to proceed at the pace we've been watching it and gets awarded in 2015. But it's also likely other projects that have been proceeding along are going to go through a reevaluation process, and if that evaluation process takes longer, those projects could very well move from '15 into '16."

It's not going to be a smooth linear line, and so we're going to see some volatility in that growth rate and a lot's going to depend, again, on the pace at which these projects are reevaluated and they're allowed to proceed and gets sanctioned, obviously, in a different, in a different design concept, but the pace at which they get reevaluated and they get sanctioned will get us back on that growth curve.

Keep in mind, part of that conversion rate has to do with the size of the backlog and the makeup of the backlog. The greatest component of our backlog right now is actually Petrobras, and as you know, that Petrobras business has a longer tail. So in part about the conversion for this year, we are actually seeing a little bit of a slowing coming out of Petrobras. What was initially going to be in 2015, they've asked us now to shift a small portion of that into 2016. So no overall change in the total, but rather, a shifting from '15 into '16, point 1. [ph] You talked about the FX conversion. That $300 million that I talked about really had to do with looking at the average rates in 2014 to 2015. So that $300 million is really off of what our previous estimates. And then our subsea service  business, we're expecting it to be a little bit slower. One of our customers, largely in the North Sea, has expressed some OpEx slowing, and we're seeing some slowing of that as well. Go onto '16, as you say, obviously, it will depend on the timing and the size of 2014. And if we can get, depending on the timing of when that order comes in, we certainly can see revenues in Subsea in 2016, again, depending on the timing of that inbound, to be flattish with 2015. If we are fortunate enough to see towards the back half of the year, as John talked about all of the reworking of those projects come to fruition, then there certainly is an opportunity to see growth in that 2016 subsea revenue number."

I know one example on some new technology, the project was very close to being sanctioned, all of the design concepts have been largely decided, and they headed the subsea organization, had a chance to review our proposed technology, and I mean, essentially, within weeks, they made the decision to adopt that new technology. So I mean, that's just an example, but it gives you a  -- it sort of illustrates the urgency in which the operators realize they have to rework these projects. So this isn't about years. And we saw that even last year, even before the decline in oil, you saw Total's Block 32 Kaombo project, it wasn't years that it took them to rework those projects. It was, I think in that case, just a quarter or 2. So I think given the urgency now and their openness to change, I think the operators are prepared. I hope they're prepared. And I think they're -- the way they're signaling to us is they're prepared to make these step change decisions fairly quickly."

So that's why we're pretty confident. I mean, other than -- as Maryann, mentioned other than the North Sea situation, this equipment's going to be delivered and it's got to be installed. So that helps support solid Gulf of Mexico service revenue related to the backlog of equipment that has to be installed. But we're also  quite confident based on the conversations we're having with customers, and as you know, our fourth Light Well intervention stack is en route as we speak to the Gulf of Mexico. We've had really good customer acceptance of the idea. We didn't expect any long-term contracts or pre-commitments, just the nature of the Gulf of Mexico. But we're quite confident that once the vessel and the stack are available, which will happen in the second quarter, that we'll be signing contracts. That system is very compelling to the operators, and based on their reaction to that system entering the Gulf of Mexico, we're confident that will continue to revenue -- service revenue growth in 2015. And then non-service, but our partners, as you suggested, that we do have a very strong market position, mostly driven by our partners in the Gulf of Mexico. With the Gulf of Mexico's large existing infrastructure, it's common for there to be smaller project awards, satellite well step-outs. Now, they'll come under the same scrutiny as a large project with regard to improving returns, but probably not as intense. And we're hopeful that the smaller projects in the Gulf of Mexico will, in fact, materialize in 2015. They tend to be a little shorter cycle in terms of the awards and therefore -- and probably, they'll be able to -- if they even go through a reevaluation process, will probably be a little bit faster than a big multibillion dollar project. So you combine all that, and we're pretty confident that Gulf of Mexico, of all our regions, will probably hold up as well, or better, than other parts of the world."

Clearly, our customers are asking for concessions and discounts, but they understand that there's limits to that and we're having conversations with them. But I don't expect significant concessions, particularly on the orders that we've received. Going forward, the competitive environment's going to be a little tougher, and we'll see the impact of the slower market in the pricing of bids that are tendered.

I'm sure Halliburton makes their own well service pump, but most of their treating iron, the WECO/Chiksan product line, it's bought from FMC and has been for a decade. So Halliburton remains an important customer of FMC. BJ Services, before they were acquired by Baker Hughes, was an important customer to FMC as well. Again, we're selling them treating iron, swivel joints, WECO/Chiksan product line. But we also had made roads with Baker Hughes in terms of our well service pump. But remember, the well service pump is a small part. We were relatively new to the industry in the well service pump, so it's not a big portion of our business. That's going to be Halliburton's decision how they integrate Baker Hughes into Halliburton and what they'd do in terms of rationalizing the equipment that they use. But on the primary product, the fluid control, the flow line, we sell to both companies. So I think the way we look at it is there may be some down side just in the consolidation of the 2 companies, but there could very well be upside. Going forward, when we get to a recovery, our fluid control business recognize the importance of improving efficiency and developing shale. They're developing products and services to do just that, and I think fluid control will continue to contribute to the successful development of shale and improving the cost efficiencies as they contribute to the industry. So I think they'll be part of the change that has to take place in shale to improve efficiency."

I think it makes a lot of sense to look back at the last downturn and it serves as an example of what we can expect. So I would say Kurt, particularly on those projects that are tendered, this would be outside of our partnerships, we're going to see competitive pressures that will drive the pricing down and I think it will look a lot like what we experienced in 2009 and 2010. I think some of the differences, to compare and contrast, I think we have more partnerships today, more alliances, more frame agreements today than we did in 2008 and 2009. And it's in the context of those partnerships, not that there aren't pricing concessions in those partnerships, but the nature is very different because those projects aren't tendered, so we get to negotiate any changes in the pricing structure. And it has -- that has a real effect on margins, a positive one, I would say, in the context negotiating with a partner. So we have more partnerships going into this. I would say our relationships with our key customers is also stronger because of our execution performance and that's helpful when you're going into a downturn and negotiating prices. And then finally, our own performance. You will remember -- I think you remember, in 2010 and 2011, we were struggling with growth and that had an impact on our ability to execute, had an impact on our cost. Remember, we had a lot of people, brand-new people, that weren't as efficient. We go into this downturn very differently than we did in 2009 and 2010. Our execution performance has never been better, our relationship with our customers has never been better. And the maturity of the investments that we made in those 2009, 2010 is very different. Those new employees that we brought on in 2010 and 2011 now have 3 and 4 years of experience behind them. Their efficiency levels are much higher than they were when we went through that last downturn. The investments we made in processes, in capacity, those are all behind us now. We are operating successfully, performing well, had an activity level that's almost double of what we were 4 years ago. And that's going to matter in terms of our net earnings because our execution's going to be better, our cost base is going to be -- the structure is going to be better. So we go, although 2008 and 2009, what we learned from that downturn, I think, will be an example of what we're going to experience this time, we go into this downturn very differently."

Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With me today is Maryann Seaman, our CFO. I'll begin my comments today focusing on our performance both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'll then discuss our current 2015 mar",1181,"Good morning. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With me today is Maryann Seaman, our CFO. 
I'll begin my comments today focusing on our performance both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'll then discuss our current 2015 market outlook, Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance and our financial outlook for 2015. And then we'll open up the call for your questions.
2014 was a very successful year for FMC Technologies. We achieved record revenue and operating income in both our Subsea Technologies and our Surface Technologies segments. Company earnings were $0.72 per diluted share for the quarter and a record $2.72 for the year. This excludes the gain related to the sale of our Material Handling business and represents a 30% increase over our prior year performance.
Maryann will provide further detail on 2 items that impacted our earnings. Company revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, taking our full year total to $7.9 billion, an 11% increase from 2013. In Subsea, we successfully executed our significant backlog, our focus on execution that began 4 years ago has greatly improved our ability to perform well at a much higher activity level. Subsea revenue for example has almost doubled over the same 4-year period.
We've also benefited from the growth of our Subsea Service business. The strategic focus we placed on service has resulted in the development of a sustainable source of growth while raising our margin profile. Again, our focus on execution delivered solid fourth quarter Subsea margins at 14.5% and our full year margins average 14.2%, a 260 basis point improvement from last year. 
Fourth quarter subsea orders totaled $1.7 billion, bringing our full year total to $5.5 billion. This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year. The total includes our announced awards from the Chevron Agbami project in Nigeria, the ENI 15/06 award in Angola and the Wintershall Maria project in Norway. Just as significant, our margins and backlog increased again in the quarter. 
Surface Technologies' fourth quarter revenue was $584 million driven by the strength of our international surface wellhead business and our North American fluid control business. Our international wellhead business continued to develop exceptional results. We've established a significant market presence in the Middle East that's enabled us maintain a solid backlog while continuing to improve our margins. 
Our North America fluid control sales activity was strong for the quarter as order activity held up until December. Overall, our quarterly segment margins of almost 20% are the highest we've delivered in 2014. 
Turning to 2015. We're responding to the slowdown in our industry as a result of the severe declines in oil prices. We will leverage the momentum of our execution improvements and the strong year end backlog from Subsea at Surface international. We're responding quickly and significantly to the slowdown in our North America businesses by reducing discretionary and capital spending. Most impactful, we have begun the process of reducing headcount company-wide by approximately 10%. The most significant reductions will come from North America, where rapid activity declines are occurring in this short-cycle market. We are also using this as an opportunity to strengthen our subsea cost position. The improvements to processes we made in our Subsea business have not only improved our quality and on-time performance, but they've improved our efficiency. These efficiency gains have positioned us to deliver a level of activity in 2015 comparable to 2014, but with a smaller, leaner subsea organization. Again, we expect to leverage our execution momentum and strong backlog to not only successfully manage through the downturn, but emerge stronger in the recovery.
Regarding our outlook for subsea orders, we do not expect our 2015 subsea orders to be as strong as 2014. As we previously discussed, many of the larger awards we have -- I had expected this year are in Africa. Historically, these awards involve national oil companies and have a greater propensity for delay. And in today's current environment, the risk of project delay is now greater. Although Subsea projects are proceeding, including the awards we received in the fourth quarter, most operators are reassessing their project portfolios, looking for ways to achieve significant cost reductions. This is a process that began last year before energy prices began falling, and the importance has now become much greater. 
FMC Technologies has been and continues to be active and directly involved in the reevaluation of projects, particularly with our partners. As a partner, we're proactive in proposing alternative approaches to project development that includes adopting cost-effective FMC standards, early acceptance of new technologies and different business models that reduce the total cost of development.  An example of our success in standardization is the 20,000 PSI 350-degrees standard specification for subsea equipment accepted by a multi-operator consortium. Our investments in technology, focused on the production system, offer a step change in savings on equipment cost. Through our unique partnerships, we have the ability to be involved early in design concepts that can optimize the full field development cost. And in today's environment, operators are much more open to different approaches that can result in significant reduction to their development cost. 
Shifting now to Surface Technologies, we're now experiencing the effect of the significant slowing in the North America land market. U.S. rig count has fallen by almost 500 rigs since the middle of November. We anticipate this decline continuing over the coming months as oil and gas prices have fallen past levels that suppose most current activity. We're now taking actions to address the reduced volumes we will experience in 2015 and we're confident these steps will allow us to effectively manage through the downturn, while at the same time, not sacrificing our ability to adjust when the cyclical market recovers.
Our North America Surface Technologies activity should remain -- I'm sorry, our non-North American Surface Technologies activity should remain healthy in 2015. We've continued to grow our market position internationally, most predominantly in the Middle East, and expect that backlog that we built will help us maintain revenue levels similar to 2014. Customer activity outside North America is typically more resilient through market cycles, but we're prepared to take action should we see markets soften beyond the current expectations. 
In conclusion, the performance in 2014 delivered record results, but it also established positive execution momentum that will enable us to successfully overcome the challenges in the current market. We're taking early and meaningful action to stay ahead of the decline in activity. 
Deepwater and shale remain an important source for oil over future decades, and as a result, continue to be an important part of operators' portfolios. To develop these assets requires forward thinking approaches, and FMC Technologies is proactively engaged with our partners, working on new ways to successfully reduce development cost and improve project returns. 
Maryann will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2015 expectations."
972117,275030837,760385,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Included in the quarterly results is $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share of foreign currency losses due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter operational",1193,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Included in the quarterly results is $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share of foreign currency losses due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter operational performance was strong across all of our 3 segments. Subsea revenue was $1.4 (sic) [$1.4 billion] with operating margins of 14.5%. Surface Technologies revenue was $584 million with operating margins of 19.9%. And Energy Infrastructure revenue was $138 million with the operating margins of 9.9%. Other revenue and expenses included $25 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, of costs associated with actions taking to de-risk our defined benefit plan. These actions were reported. Let me provide further detail on the segment results.
Subsea Technologies' operating profit was $208 million in the fourth quarter. Operating profit improved 12% year-over-year when excluding the $23 million of recognized revenue and operating profit associated with an adjustment for Angolan withholding taxes included in our 2013 results. The improving margin profile of our backlog, along with the efficiencies gained from the actions we have taken to improve operational performance, played a significant role in our full year margin performance. Additionally, we have benefited from the continued growth of our subsea services capability. 
Subsea inbound in 2014 was $5.5 billion and provides a solid base for 2015 revenue and profit. Surface Technologies generated fourth quarter operating profit of $116 million as both our fluid control and surface wellhead businesses' activity levels remained strong throughout most of the fourth quarter. Surface wellhead sales for both the fourth quarter and full year represents new record. 
Fluid control fourth quarter operating income and margins were strong, and sales remained at high levels through the majority of the quarter. However, completion services' fourth quarter sales activity was flat sequentially and operating income was down due to disappointing activity in the Canadian market. 
Orders for Surface Technologies for the quarter were $498 million. Orders for international wellhead continued to remain at strong levels, but order activity began slowing for both North America fluid control and surface wellhead. Backlog now stands at $654 million for this segment.  
Energy Infrastructure generated fourth quarter operating profit of $13.7 million. 
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $18.5 million. Other income and expense net reflects expense of $46.9 million. This includes the previously discussed charge of $24.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of costs associated with actions taken to de-risk our defined benefit pension plan. This also includes foreign exchange losses of $26 million or $0.09 per diluted share due to the deferred strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Capital spending this quarter was $121 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies' infrastructure and service asset investments. For the full year, our capital spending was $404 million. We repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.79 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average cost of $51.01. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $670 million. It was comprised of $639 million of cash and $1.3 million of debt. 
Looking at 2015. We have reasonably good visibility of revenues and operating profit for our Subsea business given the backlog of $5.8 billion. In Subsea Technologies, we expect full year revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. This estimate reflects a few changes in assumptions from earlier estimates: A strong U.S. dollar impacting 2015 projections by approximately $300 million, a reduced amount of book in turn revenue given a lower 2015 inbound expectation and a flattish year-over-year service activity. With the current margins in our backlog and the level of execution we expect to continue delivering, we are confident in our ability to attain average Subsea margins for the full year of approximately 15%. 
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. While difficult to project given the current pace of rigs coming out of the U.S. market, our Surface Technologies revenue will fall from 2014 levels. With our large international backlog and our strength in market position, we expect to have another strong year in international surface wellhead with performance similar to 2014. 
For our North American business, we are currently assuming a U.S. rig count reduction between 700 to 800 rigs from last year's peak. At this level, we would expect Surface Technologies' segment revenue to fall between 15% and 20%. In fluid control, we are seeing reduced activity, and therefore, expect volumes to decline sequentially in the first quarter, with continued weakening in subsequent quarters given the recent slowdown in orders due to reduced activity levels. 
Activity levels in surface wellhead in North America and completion services will follow similar patterns. Headcount reductions commensurate with current inbound volumes have been completed and additional plans are in place to further reduce headcount in response to continued weakening in the market. We will take actions as appropriate for order inbound levels to protect operating margins. 
Full year margin estimates in Surface Technology, we expect to be down between 400 and 450 basis points from our 2014 average if rig counts fall by 700 to 800 rigs. In Energy Infrastructure, we should see increased revenue in 2015 with margins in the low-double digits on higher activity levels in our loading systems and measurement solutions businesses. In addition to the restructuring John and I discussed relating to both Subsea and Surface Technologies, we are actively renegotiating supplier contracts across all of our businesses to lower input costs.
Regarding corporate items, we expect corporate expense to average approximately $15 million per quarter in 2015. Other expense net should average of $15 million per quarter in 2015, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We expect our interest expense to average $8 million per quarter. We anticipate our 2014 tax rate to range between 30% and 32% for the full year. We expect capital spending in 2015 to be approximately $300 million, the majority of our 2015 nonmaintenance capital spending will be directed towards profit adding subsea services and investments. 
In conclusion, our Subsea performance should continue to be strong as we execute our backlog and generate service revenue at a level consistent with 2014. Operating margins in Subsea Technologies should increase to approximately 15% in 2015, resulting in flat year-over-year operating profit. Our Subsea Technologies businesses will be challenged in North America, but with a strong international presence, we think we can deliver revenue between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. We are forecasting our international surface wellhead business to remain at levels consistent with 2014. The North America business will, however, experience significant year-over-year decline. Overall, the segment will see operating profits decline at least 30% from 2014, based on our stated range of U.S. rig count reductions. 
Corporate costs should be relatively flat to 2014 and net expenses will be lower as certain costs incurred in 2014 will not repeat. Overall, we expect to deliver solid financial performance from our non-North America land businesses. We will make the structural changes necessary to minimize short-term margin impact while protecting longer-term growth strategies.

I think if you go forward in 2015, Maryann commented in her comments that we see CapEx appropriately down. And we expect, with the revenue number and our continued improvement in working capital, that we'll continue to generate strong cash flow going forward. And as long as the stock price remains where it is, and we will continue to view those undervalued, I would expect and do expect that our buybacks going forward will probably look more like they did in 2014.

I don't think there's a single one where we haven't had exactly the kind of conversations that you're discussing. But let me describe the nature of them. First of all, our -- we believe our Subsea backlog is very secure. There have been no conversations about delaying deliveries, no cancellations, nothing of the nature. The conversations are very direct, given the -- and remember, some of these conversations I talked about in the last quarter have been going on for over a year, and that's the declining returns for E&P companies for several years is a huge concern to our customers. That's now heightened and those conversation are more intense, with the change in oil price. Our customers are telling us that they need to make a step change in the development cost of their deepwater portfolio. They realized, at least our customers realized, oh, there's lots of pricing pressure. They realize they can't get there just by talking about price discounts and so forth. We need to be talking about something more substantial, which means we've got to start working with the industry as a whole, it needs to start working differently. The conversations center around standardization. As you know, our company has been particularly successful in driving FMC standards for our partners, most notably in the achievement last year of getting 4 operators to agree on a single spec for next-generation high-pressure, high-temperature equipment. I think the acceptance of standards by our customers are now greater than it's ever been as a result of their determination to drive down costs, and we think we're in a terrific position to offer the kinds of low cost, efficient, standard designs that they're going to do to improve their returns.  The second thing we're talking about is, with the operators, is a faster adoption of new technology, particularly new technology that makes a step change in the cost of the hardware and the entire production system. FMC has been proposing for some time unique technologies that directly lower the cost of their production systems. And we're getting a lot -- not only just a lot of interest, but I think real commitment to proceed with these new technologies, which will make a step change. And then finally, particularly with our partners, there's a recognition that something has to change. This can't be incremental. We can't just roll up our sleeves and work harder and shave things around the edge. We've got to do something substantially different if we're going to expect a significant change in the development cost, and there's a real recognition that some of our business models are going to have to change. We're going to have to think a little bit differently about the entire scope of the development, not just the individual components, and how they're integrated and fit together. We've demonstrated to these partners that there are compelling cost reductions for the entire system if we'll change the way we approach the development of these projects. It -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, it absolutely is going to require that our company, the contractor, participate very early in the initial designs and concepts that the operators are using. Because of the many partnerships we have, we're uniquely positioned to participate early, and the operators that we've talked to are now, really, for the first time, encouraging us and encouraging their organizations to let us participate early so we can really deliver the step change the industry needs."

And I think they recognize that if the kind of traditional, we're in a down cycle, let's squeeze cost, you can't get there. And so there's no -- I mean, we need to talk about that. We know there's going to be some pricing pressure. We know everybody needs to sharpen their pencil. But if the conversation isn't more than that, they know they won't be able to improve the returns and that's what gives me confidence that the operators are likely to adopt at a faster pace some of the alternative approaches that we're proposing. And as you said, our alliances give us the entry to have those conversations with these customers."

A quarter ago, I talked about a long list of projects. That long list of projects, it still exists. Projects haven't been completely shelved, project teams haven't been asked to stand down. They're still being worked. Some of these projects are proceeding, and you saw that in our fourth quarter inbound. There were 3 projects, 1 or 2 of them, really, we were expecting to happen in 2015, and they got accelerated into 2014. There are other projects, even some in West Africa like Bonga, that appear to be proceeding. But we should expect that virtually all the projects on this extensive list that we originally thought would be inbound in 2015 are going to be reevaluated. The pace of that reevaluation, it's unknown. I mean, they're all going to be reevaluated. I think based on the operator's intent to try to improve their economics, I'd like to think that most of them are going to go forward. But the timing of that reevaluation means that some orders are going to still land in 2015, but others are going to end up in 2016, as each of the operators go through this evaluation process. So to answer your more specific question, yes, it's possible that Bonga continues to proceed at the pace we've been watching it and gets awarded in 2015. But it's also likely other projects that have been proceeding along are going to go through a reevaluation process, and if that evaluation process takes longer, those projects could very well move from '15 into '16."

But keep in mind, part of that conversion rate has to do with the size of the backlog and the makeup of the backlog. The greatest component of our backlog right now is actually Petrobras, and as you know, that Petrobras business has a longer tail. So in part about the conversion for this year, we are actually seeing a little bit of a slowing coming out of Petrobras. What was initially going to be in 2015, they've asked us now to shift a small portion of that into 2016. So no overall change in the total, but rather, a shifting from '15 into '16, point 1. You talked about the FX conversion. That $300 million that I talked about really had to do with looking at the average rates in 2014 to 2015. So that $300 million is really off of what our previous estimates. And then our subsea service  business, we're expecting it to be a little bit slower. One of our customers, largely in the North Sea, has expressed some OpEx slowing, and we're seeing some slowing of that as well. Go onto '16, as you say, obviously, it will depend on the timing and the size of 2014. And if we can get, depending on the timing of when that order comes in, we certainly can see revenues in Subsea in 2016, again, depending on the timing of that inbound, to be flattish with 2015. If we are fortunate enough to see towards the back half of the year, as John talked about all of the reworking of those projects come to fruition, then there certainly is an opportunity to see growth in that 2016 subsea revenue number."

But we're also  quite confident based on the conversations we're having with customers, and as you know, our fourth Light Well intervention stack is en route as we speak to the Gulf of Mexico. We've had really good customer acceptance of the idea. We didn't expect any long-term contracts or pre-commitments, just the nature of the Gulf of Mexico. But we, we're quite confident that once the vessel and the stack are available, which will happen in the second quarter, that we'll be signing contracts.

And then non-service, but our partners, as you suggested, that we do have a very strong market position, mostly driven by our partners in the Gulf of Mexico. With the Gulf of Mexico's large existing infrastructure, it's common for there to be smaller project awards, satellite well step-outs. Now, they'll come under the same scrutiny as a large project with regard to improving returns, but probably not as intense. And we're hopeful that the smaller projects in the Gulf of Mexico will, in fact, materialize in 2015. They tend to be a little shorter cycle in terms of the awards and therefore -- and probably, they'll be able to -- if they even go through a reevaluation process, it will probably be a little bit faster than a big multibillion dollar project.

But just like the last downturn, we expect some pricing pressure and greater competitiveness as we stare at some softness in the market. Let's start, though -- let's start with our backlog. I said in my prepared remarks that not only do we have strong inbound orders and the book-to-bill of 1.2 in the quarter, we also increased our margin and backlog. So for FMC, we haven't seen a decline in margins. Clearly, our customers are asking for concessions and discounts, but they understand that there's limits to that and we're having conversations with them. But I don't expect significant concessions, particularly on the orders that we've received. Going forward, the competitive environment's going to be a little tougher, and we'll see the impact of the slower market in the pricing of bids that are tendered. Having said that, just like last time, we will see the supply chain costs come down and we'll see that partially offset some of the pricing pressure. And hopefully, we'll be able to hold onto our strong margins that have been represented in our backlog for the last 1.5 years."

I'm sure Halliburton makes their own well service pump, but most of their treating iron, the WECO/Chiksan product line, it's bought from FMC and has been for a decade. So Halliburton remains an important customer of FMC. BJ Services, before they were acquired by Baker Hughes, was an important customer to FMC as well. Again, we're selling them treating iron, swivel joints, WECO/Chiksan product line. But we also had made roads with Baker Hughes in terms of our well service pump. But remember, the well service pump is a small part. We were relatively new to the industry in the well service pump, so it's not a big portion of our business. That's going to be Halliburton's decision how they integrate Baker Hughes into Halliburton and what they'd do in terms of rationalizing the equipment that they use. But on the primary product, the fluid control, the flow line, we sell to both companies. So I think the way we look at it is there may be some down side just in the consolidation of the 2 companies, but there could very well be upside. Going forward, when we get to a recovery, our fluid control business recognize the importance of improving efficiency and developing shale. They're developing products and services to do just that, and I think fluid control will continue to contribute to the successful development of shale and improving the cost efficiencies as they contribute to the industry. So I think they'll be part of the change that has to take place in shale to improve efficiency."

I think it makes a lot of sense to look back at the last downturn and it serves as an example of what we can expect. So I would say Kurt, particularly on those projects that are tendered, this would be outside of our partnerships, we're going to see competitive pressures that will drive the pricing down and I think it will look a lot like what we experienced in 2009 and 2010. I think some of the differences, to compare and contrast, I think we have more partnerships today, more alliances, more frame agreements today than we did in 2008 and 2009. And it's in the context of those partnerships, not that there aren't pricing concessions in those partnerships, but the nature is very different because those projects aren't tendered, so we get to negotiate any changes in the pricing structure. And it has -- that has a real effect on margins, a positive one, I would say, in the context negotiating with a partner. So we have more partnerships going into this. I would say our relationships with our key customers is also stronger because of our execution performance and that's helpful when you're going into a downturn and negotiating prices. And then finally, our own performance. You will remember -- I think you remember, in 2010 and 2011, we were struggling with growth and that had an impact on our ability to execute, had an impact on our cost. Remember, we had a lot of people, brand-new people, that weren't as efficient. We go into this downturn very differently than we did in 2009 and 2010. Our execution performance has never been better, our relationship with our customers has never been better. And the maturity of the investments that we made in those 2009, 2010 is very different. Those new employees that we brought on in 2010 and 2011 now have 3 and 4 years of experience behind them. Their efficiency levels are much higher than they were when we went through that last downturn. The investments we made in processes, in capacity, those are all behind us now. We are operating successfully, performing well, had an activity level that's almost double of what we were 4 years ago. And that's going to matter in terms of our net earnings because our execution's going to be better, our cost base is going to be -- the structure is going to be better. So we go, although 2008 and 2009, what we learned from that downturn, I think, will be an example of what we're going to experience this time, we go into this downturn very differently."

Welcome to our first quarter 2015 conference call. With me today is Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll discuss highlights from the quarter, Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.63 per diluted share for the quarter. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.7 billion and operating profit was $235 million. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.2 billion. This is in line with the prior year quarter and as a result of continuing to execute our strong backlog and healthy service activity.
Subsea margins increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Our focus on execution has enabled us to generate strong margins and the seasonally weak quarter. For the full year, we expect to show a year-over-year margin increase as the execution momentum generated in 2014 has been maintained in the first quarter and is expected to continue. Although, our full year Subsea revenue will remain close to last year's record level, our ability to execute has improved. Our focus on standardization, process improvement, cost reduction, supply chain and rationalizing our workforce, all contributed to these efficiency gains. As we continue to lean out the organization, we expect to further improve our cost structure throughout the remainder of the year.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound totaled $552 million. As we anticipated, our Subsea service activity remains strong. We did not announce any major awards in the first quarter and smaller project awards were also low. This level of quarterly project inbound was not unexpected as the Subsea market is going through a period of project reevaluation. In this environment with operators reassessing their project portfolios, award dates are moving to the right. There are some projects, however, that we still believe have a very good chance of being awarded this year. 
We expect to inbound at least $3 million [ph] of Subsea awards in 2015. This is based on our confidence in Subsea service activity as evidenced in the first quarter and our expectation of awards supported by customer discussions that we expect to occur in the back half of the year.
In our Surface Technologies segment, we're now experiencing significant declines in North American activity that exceeded the scenarios we discussed in February. Our fluid control inbound orders have fallen significantly this year as this business does not carry large backlog, the impact on revenue occurs quickly. In response, we have more aggressively implemented workforce reductions and continue to work with our suppliers to reduce costs and minimize the effect on our decremental margins. Overall, we're not planning for this market to recover before 2016. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continue to deliver strong performance in the first quarter. Activity was down sequentially, but increased year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver annual results at or near last year's record based on the strong market position we've built, particularly with the national oil companies in the Middle East.
Now returning to the Subsea market. Subsea project returns must improved to ensure the markets long-term success and growth. Our strategy specifically targets shortening the time to first oil, reducing Subsea development cost and increasing overall production. As earlier announced, our alliance with Technip and the creation of Forsys Subsea, our joint venture that delivers vendor-based concept and FEED studies provides a platform to improve returns. This alliance allows us to take the market leading Subsea production systems and SURF capabilities of each company and combine them in a way that was previously unavailable. Ultimately, offering cost savings that are both substantial and sustainable. 
With early involvement at the FEED stage, we can further drive product standardization and introduce vendor-based technology that cannot be placed within a traditional tender. In addition, we can also eliminate costly interfaces required when the 2 critical components of a deepwater development are managed separate and independently. We believe these changes reduce the overall cost associated with the combined Subsea production system and search scope by approximately 25% to 30%. We're confident these savings are achievable as we've not only tested this on previously executed projects, but also on projects currently under evaluation. Reaction from customers has been positive as both Technip and FMC are discussing projects previously thought to be uneconomic, as likely candidates for studies using Forsys Subsea capabilities.
We expect that the first Forsys Subsea commercial study will occur this year in 2015 and as a result, epic award could happen as early as next year. Another example of the industry challenging past business models is the unprecedented agreement by 4 operators to fund the development of standardized, high pressure, high temperature equipment for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico. Even more encouraging is the level of interest we're receiving from other operators with fields requiring this new technology. More companies in the industry are recognizing the cost savings that are achievable through this unique collaborative effort to solve an industry challenge and will likely join this alliance.
Looking forward, in the near term, we will continue to focus on execution while at the same time driving down cost and adjusting capacity to match lower activity levels. As a result, we expect to deliver solid margins as well as create a more efficient cost structure. Deepwater reserves remain a significant current and future source of the hydrocarbons that we require to meet both increasing demand and offset production declines. The Subsea industry, however, recognizes it must reduced overall cost to improve returns and enable operators to proceed with the development of their significant portfolio of deepwater discoveries. Responding to this challenge, we are now positioned to be involved early in project design, enabling the integration of critical development scope while further advancing technology and standardization to drive down cost.
Maryann will now take you through some of the financial details for the quarter."

Our Subsea technology segment delivered strong results in the quarter, offset by both a steep market-driven decline in our North American Surface Technologies businesses and weaker results from our Energy Infrastructure segment. Subsea Techn",868,"Thanks, John. Our Subsea technology segment delivered strong results in the quarter, offset by both a steep market-driven decline in our North American Surface Technologies businesses and weaker results from our Energy Infrastructure segment. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $169 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.6%. Operating margins improved 280 basis points quarter-over-quarter with operating profit increasing 19%. Operating margin both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter showed continued improvement in execution while converting a strong project backlog. Subsea service activities met expectations despite lower activities in the North Sea.
In Subsea, we began to reduce headcount in the first quarter where activity level showed weakness. Over the next several quarters, we expect to further reduce the organization where standardization drive efficiency and regional activity levels require more efficient operation.
Moving to our Surface Technology results. Surface Technology operating profit for the first quarter was $63 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year quarter. Margins in the quarter were 14.1%. We incurred charges in the quarter related to headcount reductions and operational changes, which reduced the quarterly results. Absent that, our expectations for cost management and operating margins were essentially in-line. Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to perform well as sales increased 13% quarter-over-quarter with margins improving on continued strong execution, largely related to activity in the Middle East. 
The U.S. rig count has fallen by almost 1,000 rigs since the peak last fall. This has decreased our daily orders from pressure pumping activities significantly as customer demand has weakened. As a result, our fluid controls sales fell faster than initially we expected. We are also seeing significant sequential declines in our North American surface wellhead and completion services business. We are in the process of consolidating facilities within our Surface Technologies portfolio in North America. 
Independent of the current market conditions, we are focused on improving our position in shale. We are reducing our cost structure, integrated related services on the pad and introducing new technology. These efforts are all focused on reducing development cost in the overall footprint while decreasing the time to first oil. This will help us protect our decremental margins in the near-term while improving our competitive position as we further integrate our offerings. 
We have reduced our North American Surface Technologies headcount in line with volume declines. We will have further reductions in the second quarter as we complete the operational efficiencies to achieve our North America integrated strategy. Segment backlog exiting this quarter stands at $520 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America which continues to show strength. Energy Infrastructure operating income for the first quarter was $3 million, with margins of 2.9%, which included restructuring costs. These results, while disappointing, were in large part due to delayed orders in the loading systems and measurement systems business is still expected this year. However, execution improvement are acquired in the coming quarters to improve operational performance.
Overall, in our segment operating results, we recorded $10 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter. We expect to record another $4 million to $5 million in the second quarter for further reductions across our businesses.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $16.3 million. We expect spending of approximately $15 million per quarter throughout 2015. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $26.5 million. Our first quarter equity compensation cost is higher than the remaining 3 quarters due to the amortization period for certain awards and we also experienced higher foreign exchange losses. For the remaining quarters of 2015, we expect this to be approximately $13 million per quarter subject to further foreign currency fluctuation. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 20%, which reflects the lower percentage of overall earnings subject to U.S. tax. We now anticipate our 2015 tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the full year. Capital spending this quarter was $87 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We expect capital spending in 2015 to be approximately $250 million as expenditures will be lower through the remainder of the year. 
At the end of the quarter, we had net debt of $621 million. It is comprised of $695 million of cash and $1.3 billion [ph] of debt. We averaged 234 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 776,000 shares of stock during the first quarter at an average cost of $39.75 per share.
Looking forward, we expect to deliver full year Subsea revenue that approaches $5 billion with margins of around 15% as we continue to execute well and manage our operational cost. Our Subsea services revenue should continue to remain healthy despite slowing North Sea activity. We continue to expect revenue similar to prior year levels. Surface Technologies revenue is likely to be down approximately 25% from last year, given reduced North American market activity with operating margins of approximately 12% to 13% for the full year, excluding the cost of restructuring. Energy Infrastructure revenue will be down approximately 20% year-over-year with margins of around 10%, reflecting improved execution. Orders delayed from the quarter are still expected this year.

In today's environment and I don't mean today's oil environment, I mean the rising cost of deepwater development with flat oil prices has for the last 3 to 4 years created an environment where operators returns have declined, and that's the fundamental issue for the industry is to reverse that. And all the conversations that we're having with the major deepwater operators center around how they can improve their returns and they all understand the importance of standardization, not only does it improve execution, it lowers costs and lowers leadtime. What's different this time is the determination by the operators to improve their returns in recognition that standardization is one of the best ways to do it. We see evidence of this in the high pressure, high temperature 20,000-psi equipment that we are developing for 4 operators. That is unprecedented in our industry that 4 operators would agree on a single standard, a single part number and the impetus behind that is their conviction now unlike in the past to adopt industry standards. The conversations that we are having after our announcement of our alliance with Technip are similar in nature where the operators are very interested in how we can introduce standards early in the design and concept process. I think there's a real movement, if you will, to adopt standards in a way that has eluded the industry for several decades and we're now getting evidence of that, again high pressure, high temperature equipment is probably  1 of the best examples of 4 operators and I think there will be more to come that will adopt that standard."

So just looking at the scope is expect both scope would find opportunities for reduction and it will come equally split from both pieces of the SPS scope and the SURF scopes, so I think if you had to guess, it's probably just 50/50. But there are very specific ways that this alliance drives down cost. First, as I mentioned, the opportunity to introduce standards. When we're involved through the concept design stage, through the FEED capabilities of FMC and Technip, through the JV forces, we'll be able to influence the standards that are established. We'll be able to both Technip technology and fMC technology, will be able to be introduced at the concept stage, which can significantly drive down cost. The other opportunity for reducing cost is the interface between these 2 critical scopes of Subsea production systems and SURF, and this is in both our testing of this concept and these capabilities with past projects and projects we're currently evaluating for our partners, we found significant opportunities, again in the 25% to 30% reduction range by actually eliminating hardware at the interface between SPS and SURF installation. We've also found opportunities to more efficiently install the Subsea equipment including the production flow lines because we're managing the interface between SPS and SURF in a combined manner. So right of the top of my head, more standardization, faster introduction to new technology, eliminating hardware at the interface between these 2 critical scopes and the opportunity for more efficient installation because the 2 pieces are being integrated."

So we feel pretty confident about our full year margins in the range of 15%.

On a run rate, it looks, for the first quarter, full year run rate, if we maintained that level and we, absolutely expect that we will, it will mirror what we saw in 2014. So somewhere in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of subsea services makes up half of the $3 billion. Where does the rest come from? Some will come from smaller or less than $100 million orders. The first quarter inbound rate for those smaller orders was about half what we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that's the result of a bit of a stall or pause by the operators when they revise their budgets. There was a lot of distraction in the first quarter. They weren't ready to proceed with some of the smaller projects that were on their list because they needed to get their budgets sorted out. Although, we did book several hundred million dollars of smaller awards in the first quarter. It was down from what we saw in the fourth quarter and we expect that to get back up to more normal levels in future quarters. And then as we said in the last call, this focus on returns, the downturn, the capital pullback by the operators has caused them to evaluate and reassess their planned deepwater projects and so we fully expect that these projects would move to the right and start to be awarded in the second half of the year. We have been targeting several projects that we are highly confident will be awarded this year and it's the combination of those larger project that we have confidence in, and increase in the smaller projects that we didn't see in the first quarter and on the run rate for service, which we did see in the first quarter continuing that gives us confidence that we'll at least do $3 billion for the year.
In terms of projects and regions, again all the projects are moving to the writers are being evaluated. Some of them will fall in 2015, some will move into 2016, it's a little hard to predict right now where Gilleland this year are moving into next year. In terms of regions, we're not looking for much in Brazil, as you know, Petrobras placed their big multiyear contracts several years ago, so we don't expect a lot of inbound necessarily in Brazil we. Expect the Gulf of Mexico to continue to be strong the big projects in West Africa, we just need to watch the timing because they have a tendency to move to the right. So I'd say Brazil, a little softer, Gulf of Mexico should say strong, West Africa will depend on the timing of these big projects as they get awarded."

Now we know going forward, as you pointed out in the next 18 or so months with the shift of major projects being awarded later in the year, 2015 being a softer year for Subsea inbound, but there'll probably be more pricing pressure just in terms of the competitive environment, so I'd see there's clearly a potential for some softening in margins, particularly maybe major projects will be awarded. I remember at the same time, we are significantly reducing our costs, so the balance in the supply chain costs are also coming down. So how that actually plays out in terms of net margins to us, isn't clear yet, but we should expect that there's clearly a chance and opportunity that margins will become a little bit softer as we go through this slower period over the course of the next 9 to 12 months. Then we get back into 2016 and the Subsea awards start to be inbounded at a more normal rate, hopefully the margins would start to stabilize."

Actually the combined surface PS is the second largest component of the deepwater development.
Now what are the stumbling blocks? I mean the stumbling blocks, in my view, is really the industry, willing to accept and adapt very different business models. It just doesn't make sense to me. It's illogical to think we're going to get 30-plus-percent savings over a complete deepwater development without doing something fundamentally different and that's what is so -- I think so attractive to the operators of the Forsys capabilities. They understand that we can't just keep doing things the same way that we've always done and then expect some huge material savings at least in a sustainable way. And so the reaction that we've got since the announcement of Forsys has been extraordinary. Virtually, every one of our partners and some of our non-partners have asked to know a lot more about Forsys capabilities, including identifying specific projects that they would like to apply the Forsys capabilities to either improve their returns or make a project that was previously thought economic, now economics so they can proceed with the development. But they were also recognized and I believe this time their prepared, the operators are prepared in conjunction with Technip and FMC to try a different business model, so we can exploit those potential savings. I think that's the biggest stumbling block because that's sort of the mind shift, if you will, mind set to a different business model."

Historically, there hasn't been repricing at the existing backlog, largely, it stays intact. There's been conversations about maybe how we can reduce cost, that certainly, particularly maybe some of our service rates and that sort of thing. But almost every case the conversation is around how can we change the scope? How can we do something different to reduce the costs as supposed to straight pricing? So when it comes to the existing backlog and again, I'd point on where to service work, the conversations have been around changing scope, doing things differently to reduce their cost, not necessarily pricing. With regard to what happened every, downturn is different. I don't -- I think it varies by projects. On our partner contracts, we tend to negotiate our contracts, which looked very different than a tendered project. So Doug, I would just hesitate to put a number on what the pricing reduction is in a down cycle. It really varies. I don't think -- we saw softness in the last downturn, but we were also able to offset some of the softness through cost-reduction. I think we have a unique position because of our alliances and our projects tend to be negotiated, so we don't have maybe as significant swings in pricing as you do when you have a major project that is tendered by 4 different suppliers and the opportunity for 1 to maybe be more significantly more aggressive. So I'd say our pricing declines tend to be a little bit more stable and moderated in the downturn than maybe the industry as a whole."

Several of those partners have actually identified candidates to proceed with applying the capabilities. We have also had conversations with non-partners who are interested in the concept and they too, have identified candidates at which we would apply the Forsys capabilities. So I think Forsys gives us the opportunity to strengthen the partnerships that we currently have and to potentially add new partners or expand our market position. I might mention though this isn't related to Forsys Subsea, the idea of how our company can offer opportunities to improve returns and that's back to the high pressure, high temperature equipment that we're building for the Gulf of Mexico. The 4 partner, the 4 companies that are part of that Consortium were also FMC partners, but we now have non-partners that are asking or considering I should say, and are actually well into the evaluation of whether or not they can participate in that Consortium.

FMC is uniquely positioned to drive those efficiencies because not only are we providing the will lead equipment were providing the frac rental equipment were providing the completion equipment and were providing the flow back services.

No opportunity to standardize a understand every metering skid is unique to that particular pad their separation systems whether it be temporary or permanent are unique to that pad the tremendous opportunities for integration and standardization and bundling of services and products that really no other company has the capability if they do they don't have the leadership position in those capabilities to pull that off.

With me today is Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter, Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.63 per diluted share for the quarter. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.7 billion and operating profit was $235 million. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.2 billion. This is in line with the prior year quarter and as a result of continuing to execute our strong backlog and healthy service activity.
Subsea margins increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Our focus on execution has enabled us to generate strong margins in a seasonally weak quarter. For the full year, we expect to show a year-over-year margin increase as the execution momentum generated in 2014 has been maintained in the first quarter and is expected to continue. 
Although our full year Subsea revenue will remain close to last year's record level, our ability to execute has improved. Our focus on standardization, process improvement, cost reduction, supply chain and rationalizing our workforce all contributed to these efficiency gains. As we continue to lean out the organization, we expect to further improve our cost structure throughout the remainder of the year.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound totaled $552 million. As we anticipated, our subsea service activity remains strong. We did not announce any major awards in the first quarter and smaller project awards were also low. This level of quarterly project inbound was not unexpected as the Subsea market is going through a period of project reevaluation. In this environment with operators reassessing their project portfolios, award dates are moving to the right. There are some projects, however, that we still believe have a very good chance of being awarded this year. 
We expect to inbound at least $3 billion of Subsea awards in 2015. This is based on our confidence in subsea service activity, as evidenced in the first quarter, and our expectation of awards supported by customer discussions that we expect to occur in the back half of the year.
In our Surface Technologies segment, we're now experiencing significant declines in North American activity that exceeded the scenarios we discussed in February. Our fluid control inbound orders have fallen significantly this year. As this business does not carry large backlog, the impact on revenue occurs quickly. In response, we have more aggressively implemented workforce reductions and continue to work with our suppliers to reduce cost and minimize the effect on our decremental margins. Overall, we're not planning for this market to recover before 2016. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to deliver strong performance in the first quarter. Activity was down sequentially, but increased year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver annual results at or near last year's record based on the strong market position we've built, particularly with the national oil companies in the Middle East.
Now returning to the Subsea market. Subsea project returns must improve to ensure the market's long-term success and growth. Our strategy specifically targets shortening the time to first oil, reducing subsea development cost and increasing overall production. As earlier announced, our alliance with Technip and the creation of Forsys Subsea, our joint venture that delivers vendor-based concept and FEED studies, provides a platform to improve returns. This alliance allows us to take the market-leading subsea production systems and SURF capabilities of each company and combine them in a way that was previously unavailable, ultimately offering cost savings that are both substantial and sustainable. 
With early involvement at the FEED stage, we can further drive product standardization and introduce vendor-based technology that cannot be placed within a traditional tender. In addition, we can also eliminate costly interfaces required when the 2 critical components of a deepwater development are managed separate and independently. We believe these changes reduce the overall costs associated with the combined subsea production system and search scope by approximately 25% to 30%. We're confident these savings are achievable as we've not only tested this on previously executed projects, but also on projects currently under evaluation. 
Reaction from customers has been positive, as both Technip and FMC are discussing projects previously thought to be uneconomic as likely candidates for studies using Forsys Subsea capabilities. We expect that the first Forsys Subsea commercial study will occur this year in 2015 and as a result, EPIC award could happen as early as next year. 
Another example of the industry challenging past business models is the unprecedented agreement by 4 operators to fund the development of standardized, high-pressure, high-temperature equipment for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico. Even more encouraging is the level of interest we're receiving from other operators with fields requiring this new technology. More companies in the industry are recognizing the cost savings that are achievable through this unique collaborative effort to solve an industry challenge and will likely join this alliance.
Looking forward, in the near term, we will continue to focus on execution while at the same time, driving down cost and adjusting capacity to match lower activity levels. As a result, we expect to deliver solid margins as well as create a more efficient cost structure. 
Deepwater reserves remain a significant current and future source of the hydrocarbons that will be required to meet both increasing demand and offset production declines. The subsea industry, however, recognizes it must reduce overall cost to improve returns and enable operators to proceed with the development of their significant portfolio of deepwater discoveries. Responding to this challenge, we are now positioned to be involved early in project design, enabling the integration of critical development scope while further advancing technology and standardization to drive down cost.
Maryann will now take you through some of the financial details for the quarter."

Our Subsea Technology segment delivered strong results in the quarter, offset by both a steep market-driven decline in our North American Surface Technologies businesses and weaker results from our Energy Infrastructure segment. Subsea Techn",870,"Thanks, John. Our Subsea Technology segment delivered strong results in the quarter, offset by both a steep market-driven decline in our North American Surface Technologies businesses and weaker results from our Energy Infrastructure segment. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $169 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.6%. Operating margins improved 280 basis points quarter-over-quarter with operating profit increasing 19%. Operating margin, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter, showed continued improvement in execution while converting a strong project backlog. Subsea service activities met expectations despite lower activities in the North Sea.
In Subsea, we began to reduce headcount in the first quarter where activity level showed weakness. Over the next several quarters, we expect to further reduce the organization where standardization drives efficiency and regional activity levels require more efficient operation.
Moving to our Surface Technology results. Surface Technology operating profit for the first quarter was $63 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year quarter. Margins in the quarter were 14.1%. We incurred charges in the quarter related to headcount reductions and operational changes, which reduced the quarterly result. Absent that, our expectations for cost management and operating margins were essentially in line. Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to perform well as sales increased 13% quarter-over-quarter with margins improving on continued strong execution, largely related to activity in the Middle East. 
The U.S. rig count has fallen by almost 1,000 rigs since the peak last fall. This has decreased our daily orders from pressure pumping activities significantly as customer demand has weakened. As a result, our fluid control sales fell faster than initially expected. We are also seeing significant sequential declines in our North American surface wellhead and completion services business. We are in the process of consolidating facilities within our Surface Technologies portfolio in North America. 
Independent of the current market conditions, we are focused on improving our position in shale. We are reducing our cost structure, integrated related services on the pad and introducing new technology. These efforts are all focused on reducing development cost and the overall footprint while decreasing the time to first oil. This will help us protect our decremental margins in the near term while improving our competitive position as we further integrate our offerings. 
We have reduced our North American Surface Technologies headcount in line with volume declines. We will have further reductions in the second quarter as we complete the operational efficiencies to achieve our North America integrated strategy. Segment backlog exiting this quarter stands at $520 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to show strength. 
Energy Infrastructure operating income for the first quarter was $3 million, with margins of 2.9%, which included restructuring costs. These results, while disappointing, were in large part due to delayed orders in the loading systems and measurement systems businesses still expected this year. However, execution improvement are acquired in the coming quarters to improve operational performance.
Overall, in our segment operating results, we recorded $10 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter. We expect to record another $4 million to $5 million in the second quarter for further reductions across our businesses.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $16.3 million. We expect spending of approximately $15 million per quarter throughout 2015. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $26.5 million. Our first quarter equity compensation cost is higher than the remaining 3 quarters due to the amortization period for certain awards, and we also experienced higher foreign exchange losses. For the quarter -- for the remaining quarters of 2015, we expect this to be approximately $13 million per quarter subject to further foreign currency fluctuation. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 20%, which reflects the lower percentage of overall earnings subject to U.S. tax. We now anticipate our 2015 tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the full year. 
Capital spending this quarter was $87 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We expect capital spending in 2015 to be approximately $250 million as expenditures will be lower through the remainder of the year. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt of $621 million. It is comprised of $695 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. 
We averaged 234 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 776,000 shares of stock during the first quarter at an average cost of $39.75 per share.
Looking forward, we expect to deliver full year Subsea revenue that approaches $5 billion with margins of around 15% as we continue to execute well and manage operational costs. Our subsea services revenue should continue to remain healthy despite slowing North Sea activity. We continue to expect revenue similar to prior year levels. Surface Technologies revenue is likely to be down approximately 25% from last year, given reduced North American market activity, with operating margins of approximately 12% to 13% for the full year, excluding the cost of restructuring. Energy Infrastructure revenue will be down approximately 20% year-over-year, with margins of around 10% reflecting improved execution. Orders delayed from the quarter are still expected this year.

The industry has been talking about standardization for decades, but there's been, for a variety of reasons, resistance to actually adopt standards. Some operators have been more successful than others and I think it's where they have been able to standardize, they've been able to demonstrate better project execution and lower oil development cost. 
In today's environment, and I don't mean today's oil environment, I mean the rising cost of deepwater development with flat oil prices, has for the last 3 to 4 years created an environment where operators' returns have declined. And that's the fundamental issue for the industry, is to reverse that. And all the conversations that we're having with major deepwater operators center around how they can improve their returns, and they all understand the importance of standardization. Not only does it improve execution, it lowers costs and lowers lead time. 
What's different this time is the determination by the operators to improve their returns and recognition that standardization is one of the best ways to do it. We see evidence of this in the high-pressure, high-temperature 20,000-psi equipment that we are developing for 4 operators. That is unprecedented in our industry, that 4 operators would agree on a single standard, a single part number. And the impetus behind that is their conviction now, unlike in the past, to adopt industry standards. 
The conversations that we are having after our announcement of our alliance with Technip are similar in nature, where the operators are very interested in how we can introduce standards early in the design and concept process. So I think there's a real movement, if you will, to adopt standards in a way that has eluded the industry for several decades and we're now getting evidence of that. Again, high-pressure, high-temperature equipment is probably one of the best examples of 4 operators, and I think there's -- that there will be more to come that will adopt that standard."

The alliance with Technip, I believe you mentioned -- I figure this number is wrong, I apologize, but the projects could lower cost by 25% to 30%. How much of this is coming from, say, the Subsea construction part? How much is coming from the equipment maybe standardization or using a little less equipment on the seabed. Could you maybe break that cost savings out a little? Or how much, I guess, is from just lowering the time line of the deepwater project?"
972117,284786541,792019,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","These savings come from a variety of areas, but if you just look at the scope of the SPS and the SURF scope, it's about equally split.

So just looking at the scope, you'd expect both scope would find opportunities for reduction and it would come equally split from both pieces of the SPS scope and the SURF scope. So I think if you had to guess, it's probably just 50/50. 
But there are very specific ways that this alliance drives down cost. First, as I mentioned, the opportunity to introduce standards. When we're involved through the concept design stage, through the FEED capabilities of FMC and Technip, through the JV, Forsys, we'll be able to influence the standards that are established. We'll be able to -- both Technip technology and FMC technology would be able to be introduced at the concept stage, which can significantly drive down cost. 
The other opportunity for reducing cost is the interface between these 2 critical scopes of subsea production systems and SURF. And this is in both our testing of this concept and these capabilities with past projects and projects we're currently evaluating for our partners. We found significant opportunities, again in the 25% to 30% reduction range, by actually eliminating hardware at the interface between SPS and SURF installation. We've also found opportunities to more efficiently install the subsea equipment, including the production flow lines, because we're managing the interface between SPS and SURF in a combined manner. So right off the top of my head, more standardization, faster introduction to new technology, eliminating hardware at the interface between these 2 critical scopes and the opportunity for more efficient installation because the 2 pieces are being integrated."

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, execution played a very important role. You've seen over the last 18 months where we have been consistently improving execution and it continues to improve.

We are also -- even though our activity level in Subsea is staying up because of our high backlog, we started to take a number of actions to reduce our cost structure. And some of that is starting to appear in margins. I think there'll be a lot more to come in future quarters. 
Let me ask Maryann to give a little bit more color on the margin performance."

You may remember this time last year, we did have 2 stacks down and we incurred the cost associated with the recertification. Obviously, that didn't happen. But as John mentioned, a lot of that is really coming from the solid execution, the good work that's been done at these higher volumes and again, the early work on headcount this time. So we feel pretty confident about our full year margins in the range of 15%. You may think about the change from Q1 to Q2 perhaps not being as severe as it has in the past quarters, because you know our first quarter is typically our weakest. But again, mix pretty similar as it has been in prior quarters."

But the follow-up question would be on the order intake, $550 million in the first quarter versus $3 billion minimum for the full year. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about this step up in activity, which is, of course, second half loaded. Is it contingent upon any particular project? Is it -- or any region that is important, for example, new orders in Brazil? Just a little bit of color on the composition of the ramp in order intake."

It -- on a run rate, it looks, for the first quarter, full year run rate, if we maintained that level and we absolutely expect that we will, it will mirror what we saw in 2014. So somewhere in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of subsea services makes up half of the $3 billion. 
Where does the rest come from? Some will come from smaller or less than $100 million orders. The first quarter inbound rate for those smaller orders was about half what we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that's the result of a bit of a stall or pause by the operators when they revise their budgets. There was a lot of distraction in that first quarter. They weren't ready to proceed with some of the smaller projects that were on their list because they needed to get their budgets sorted out. Although we did book several hundred million dollars of small awards in the first quarter, it was down from what we saw in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to get back up to more normal levels in future quarters. 
And then as we said in the last call, this focus on returns, the downturn in our industry, the capital pullback by the operators, has caused them to evaluate and reassess their planned deepwater projects. And so we fully expect that these projects would move to the right and start to be awarded in the second half of the year. 
We have been targeting several projects that we are highly confident will be awarded this year, and it's the combination of those larger projects that we have confidence in, in increase in the smaller projects that we didn't see in the first quarter and on the run rate for service, which we did see in the first quarter continuing, that gives us confidence that we'll at least do $3 billion for the year.
In terms of projects and regions, again, all the projects are moving to the right as they're being reevaluated. Some of them will fall in 2015. Some will move into 2016. It's a little hard to predict right now where -- whether they'll land this year or move into next year. 
In terms of regions, we're not looking for much in Brazil. As you know, Petrobras placed their big multiyear contracts several years ago, so we don't expect a lot of inbound necessarily in Brazil. We expect the Gulf of Mexico to continue to be strong. The big projects in West Africa, we just need to watch the timing because they have a -- will have a tendency to move to the right. So I'd say Brazil, a little softer. Gulf of Mexico should say strong. West Africa will depend on the timing of these big projects as they get awarded."

Now we know going forward, as you pointed out in the next 18 or so months, with the shift of major projects being awarded later in the year, 2015 being a softer year for Subsea inbound, that there'll probably be more pricing pressure just in terms of the competitive environment. So I'd see -- there clearly is the potential for some softening in margins, particularly that maybe major projects will be awarded. 
Now remember at the same time, we are significantly reducing our costs, so the balance in the supply chain costs are also coming down. So how that actually plays out in terms of net margins to us, isn't clear yet. But we should expect that there's clearly a chance and opportunity that margins will become a little bit softer as we go through this slower period over the course of the next 9 to 12 months.

It's split evenly. The other big number -- and it's a big number in the sense that it's 50% of the overall development cost, is in drilling. After that, it's less than 10% pieces topside and so forth. Actually, the combined SURF, SPS is the second-largest component of the deepwater development.
Now what are the stumbling blocks? I mean the stumbling blocks, in my view, is really the industry willing to accept and adapt very different business models. It just doesn't make sense to me. It's illogical to think that we're going to get 30-plus-percent savings over a complete deepwater development without doing something fundamentally different. And that's what is so, I think, so attractive to the operators of the Forsys capabilities. They understand that we can't just keep doing things the same way we've always done them and then expect some huge material savings, at least in a sustainable way. 
And so the reaction that we've got since the announcement of Forsys has been, well, extraordinary. Virtually every one of our partners and some of our non-partners have asked to know a lot more about Forsys capabilities, including identifying specific projects that they would like to apply the Forsys capabilities to, to either improve their returns or make a project that was previously thought economic, now economic so they can proceed with the development. But they also recognized -- and I believe this time, they're prepared, the operators are prepared in conjunction with Technip and FMC, to try a different business model so we can exploit those potential savings. I think that's the biggest stumbling block because that's sort of mind shift, if you will, or mind set to a different business model."

There's been conversations about maybe how we can reduce cost. That certainly -- particularly in maybe some of our service rates and that sort of thing. 
But in almost every case the conversation is around how can we change the scope? How can we do something different to reduce the cost as opposed to straight pricing? So when it comes to the existing backlog -- and again, I'd point more to service work, the conversations have been around changing scope, doing things differently to reduce their cost, not necessarily pricing. 
With regard to what happened in the -- every downturn is different. I don't -- I think it varies by projects. On our partner contracts, we tend to negotiate our contracts, which look very different than a tendered project. So don't -- Doug, I would just hesitate to put a number on what the pricing reduction is in a down cycle. It really varies. I don't think -- we saw softness in the last downturn, but we were also able to offset some of the softness through cost reduction. I think we have a unique position because of our alliances and our projects tend to be negotiated. So we don't have maybe as significant swings in pricing as you do when you have a major project that is tendered by 4 different suppliers, and the opportunity for 1 to maybe be more significantly more aggressive. So I'd say our pricing declines tend to be a little bit more stable and moderated in a downturn than maybe the industry as a whole."

A lot of them have concentrated on the drilling side, on the geology side, on the downhole side, a lot of improvements on the fracking side.

And I think that as a really ripe opportunity for the industry to demonstrate the same kind of efficiency improvements that the more upstream part of the process was already been able to achieve. 
FMC is uniquely positioned to drive those efficiencies because, not only are we providing the well head equipment, we're providing the frac rental equipment, we're providing the completion equipment and we're providing the flowback services. I don't think any other company has that combination of services. Today the operators are contracting each of those services and products out separately with separate crews. There's no opportunity to integrate those pieces in a cost-effective way, no opportunity to standardize. I understand every metering skid is unique to that particular pad. Their separation systems, whether it be temporary or permanent, are unique to that pad. There are tremendous opportunities for integration and standardization and bundling of services and products that really, no other company has that capability. Or if they do, they don't have the leadership position in those capabilities to pull that off. 
We've been working with several operators on either bundling these capabilities, providing standard equipment, introducing new technology for more efficient separation, for example. And we're very encouraged by the -- at least, the early signs of efficiency improvement, that we can get from that final frac to that first oil. That would give us a competitive advantage. I think it gives us a competitive advantage over other companies that don't have that suite of products and services."

Let me start, though, by describing the conversations we're having with our partners and actually, virtually every operator. The commitment by our partners and non-partners alike in terms of the developing their huge deepwater portfolios that they have been so successful at discovering, their commitment to development is completely unchanged. There's been no evidence that I've seen in these conversations that the operators have any change with regard to their plans to develop their portfolio and deliver future production from deepwater. Virtually all the conversations are about how can we lower cost, do things different, improve returns so we can get on with developing our portfolio and delivering the production from our deepwater assets. 
So in that context, what the operators are doing is they're looking their long list of projects that they had originally planned 1.5 years ago, 2 years ago to go through FID process and award projects and proceed with the development. That long list for 2015 is being reevaluated. And those -- and the process of that reevaluation, which takes time, is pushing those projects to the right and that's one reason why you didn't see a lot of major projects, as are, certainly for us, major projects being awarded in the first quarter. That's why we believe that the projects that will be awarded this year are going to be pushed to the back end of 2015. There will be some projects that will move from 2015 into 2016, but this reevaluation process is a temporary stall or delay while they go through that reevaluation. 
Now the reevaluation doesn't take years. Eventually, these projects get reevaluated. They get back into the FID queue and you start seeing awards. You're going to see that in the second half this year. And then, as you get into 2015, you're going to get back to a more normal flow of subsea awards because they would've gone through this FID queue and they'll get back to their developing their project portfolio. I'm quite confident of that. 
Therefore, when you look at 2016 inbound, and I'm obviously way ahead of my skis predicting what 2016 inbound will look like, there's no reason to believe that it won't be higher than 2015, because you won't have this 6-month delay while they go through the reevaluation process. So absolutely, it should start to return to normal in 2016, as the operators are successful in reworking their projects."

The step changes allow the operators to completely develop their entire portfolio of deepwater. I mean, there's over 400 deepwater discoveries that have yet to be developed. The pace of new discoveries versus projects that are being developed is greater and we need to get on -- the industry needs to get on with accelerating the development of their discoveries, and that's only going to happen with the step change. But the 2016, for example, notice your improvements in subsea awards is going to happen in part because of the step change and also independent of the step change, because those -- there are projects in that queue that are economic and can contribute to our customers' production without the step change.

With me today is Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter, Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.63 per diluted share for the quarter. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.7 billion and operating profit was $235 million. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.2 billion. This is in line with the prior year quarter and is a result of continuing to execute our strong backlog and healthy service activity. Subsea margins increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Our focus on execution has enabled us to generate strong margins in a seasonally weak quarter. For the full year, we expect to show a year-over-year margin increase as the execution momentum generated in 2014 has been maintained in the first quarter and is expected to continue. 
Although our full year Subsea revenue will remain close to last year's record level, our ability to execute has improved. Our focus on standardization, process improvement, cost reduction, supply chain and rationalizing our workforce all contributed to these efficiency gains. As we continue to lean out the organization, we expect to further improve our cost structure throughout the remainder of the year.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound totaled $552 million. As we anticipated, our subsea service activity remains strong. We did not announce any major awards in the first quarter and smaller project awards were also low. This level of quarterly project inbound was not unexpected as the Subsea market is going through a period of project reevaluation. In this environment with operators reassessing their project portfolios, award dates are moving to the right. There are some projects, however, that we still believe have a very good chance of being awarded this year. We expect to inbound at least $3 billion of Subsea awards in 2015. This is based on our confidence in subsea service activity, as evidenced in the first quarter, and our expectation of awards supported by customer discussions that we expect to occur in the back half of the year.
In our Surface Technologies segment, we're now experiencing significant declines in North American activity that exceeded the scenarios we discussed in February. Our fluid control inbound orders have fallen significantly this year. As this business does not carry a large backlog, the impact on revenue occurs quickly. In response, we have more aggressively implemented workforce reductions and continue to work with our suppliers to reduce cost and minimize the effect on our decremental margins. Overall, we're not planning for this market to recover before 2016. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to deliver strong performance in the first quarter. Activity was down sequentially, but increased year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver annual results at or near last year's record based on the strong market position we've built, particularly with the national oil companies in the Middle East.
Now returning to the Subsea market. Subsea project returns must improve to ensure the market's long-term success and growth. Our strategy specifically targets shortening the time to first oil, reducing subsea development cost and increasing overall production. As earlier announced, our alliance with Technip and the creation of Forsys Subsea, our joint venture that delivers vendor-based concept and FEED studies, provides a platform to improve returns. This alliance allows us to take the market-leading subsea production systems and SURF capabilities of each company and combine them in a way that was previously unavailable, ultimately offering cost savings that are both substantial and sustainable. 
With early involvement at the FEED stage, we can further drive product standardization and introduce vendor-based technology that cannot be placed within a traditional tender. In addition, we can also eliminate costly interfaces required when the 2 critical components of a deepwater development are managed separate and independently. We believe these changes reduce the overall costs associated with the combined subsea production systems and search scope by approximately 25% to 30%. We're confident these savings are achievable as we've not only tested this on previously executed projects, but also on projects currently under evaluation.  Reaction from customers has been positive, as both Technip and FMC are discussing projects previously thought to be uneconomic as likely candidates for studies using Forsys Subsea capabilities. We expect that the first Forsys Subsea commercial study will occur this year in 2015 and as a result, EPIC award could happen as early as next year. 
Another example of the industry challenging past business models is the unprecedented agreement by 4 operators to fund the development of standardized, high-pressure, high-temperature equipment for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico. Even more encouraging is the level of interest we're receiving from other operators with fields requiring this new technology. More companies in the industry are recognizing the cost savings that are achievable through this unique collaborative effort to solve an industry challenge and will likely join this alliance.
Looking forward, in the near term, we will continue to focus on execution while at the same time, driving down cost and adjusting capacity to match lower activity levels. As a result, we expect to deliver solid margins as well as create a more efficient cost structure. Deepwater reserves remain a significant current and future source of the hydrocarbons that will be required to meet both increasing demand and offset production declines. The subsea industry, however, recognizes it must reduce overall cost to improve returns and enable operators to proceed with the development of their significant portfolio of deepwater discoveries. Responding to this challenge, we are now positioned to be involved early in project design, enabling the integration of critical development scope while further advancing technology and standardization to drive down cost.
Maryann will now take you through some of the financial details for the quarter."

Our Subsea Technology segment delivered strong results in the quarter, offset by both a steep market-driven decline in our North American Surface Technologies businesses and weaker results from our Energy Infrastructure segment. Subsea Techn",870,"Thanks, John. Our Subsea Technology segment delivered strong results in the quarter, offset by both a steep market-driven decline in our North American Surface Technologies businesses and weaker results from our Energy Infrastructure segment. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $169 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.6%. Operating margins improved 280 basis points quarter-over-quarter with operating profit increasing 19%. Operating margin, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter, showed continued improvement in execution while converting a strong project backlog. Subsea service activities met expectations despite lower activities in the North Sea. In Subsea, we began to reduce headcount in the first quarter where activity levels showed weakness. Over the next several quarters, we expect to further reduce the organization where standardization drives efficiency and regional activity levels require more efficient operations.
Moving to our Surface Technology results. Surface Technology operating profit for the first quarter was $63 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year quarter. Margins in the quarter were 14.1%. We incurred charges in the quarter related to headcount reductions and operational changes, which reduced the quarterly result. Absent that, our expectations for cost management and operating margins were essentially in line. Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to perform well as sales increased 13% quarter-over-quarter with margins improving on continued strong execution, largely related to activity in the Middle East. 
The U.S. rig count had fallen by almost 1,000 rigs since the peak last fall. This has decreased our daily orders from pressure pumping activities significantly as customer demand has weakened. As a result, our fluid control sales fell faster than initially expected. We are also seeing significant sequential declines in our North American surface wellhead and completion services business. We are in the process of consolidating facilities within our Surface Technologies portfolio in North America. Independent of the current market conditions, we are focused on improving our position in shale. We are reducing our cost structure, integrated related services on the pad and introducing new technology. These efforts are all focused on reducing development cost and the overall footprint while decreasing the time to first oil. This will help us protect our decremental margins in the near term while improving our competitive position as we further integrate our offerings. 
We have reduced our North American Surface Technologies headcount in line with volume declines. We will have further reductions in the second quarter as we complete the operational efficiencies to achieve our North America integrated strategy. Segment backlog exiting this quarter stands at $520 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to show strength. 
Energy Infrastructure operating income for the first quarter was $3 million, with margins of 2.9%, which included restructuring costs. These results, while disappointing, were in large part due to delayed orders in the loading systems and measurement systems businesses still expected this year. However, execution improvements are acquired in the coming quarters to improve operational performance. Overall, in our segment operating results, we recorded $10 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter. We expect to record another $4 million to $5 million in the second quarter for further reductions across our businesses.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $16.3 million. We expect spending of approximately $15 million per quarter throughout 2015. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $26.5 million. Our first quarter equity compensation cost is higher than the remaining 3 quarters due to the amortization period for certain awards, and we also experienced higher foreign exchange losses. For the quarter -- for the remaining quarters of 2015, we expect this to be approximately $13 million per quarter subject to further foreign currency fluctuation.  Our first quarter tax rate was 20%, which reflects the lower percentage of overall earnings subject to U.S. tax. We now anticipate our 2015 tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the full year. 
Capital spending this quarter was $87 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We expect capital spending in 2015 to be approximately $250 million as expenditures will be lower through the remainder of the year. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt of $621 million. It is comprised of $695 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt.  We averaged 234 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 776,000 shares of stock during the first quarter at an average cost of $39.75 per share.
Looking forward, we expect to deliver full year Subsea revenue that approaches $5 billion with margins of around 15% as we continue to execute well and manage operational costs. Our subsea services revenue should continue to remain healthy despite slowing North Sea activity. We continue to expect revenue similar to prior year levels. Surface Technologies revenue is likely to be down approximately 25% from last year, given reduced North American market activity, with operating margins of approximately 12% to 13% for the full year, excluding the cost of restructuring. Energy Infrastructure revenue will be down approximately 20% year-over-year, with margins of around 10% reflecting improved execution. Orders delayed from the quarter are still expected this year.

The industry has been talking about standardization for decades, but there's been, for a variety of reasons, resistance to actually adopt standards. Some operators have been more successful than others and I think it's where they have been able to standardize, they've been able to demonstrate better project execution and lower all development costs.  In today's environment, and I don't mean today's oil environment, I mean the rising cost of deepwater development with flat oil prices, has for the last 3 to 4 years created an environment where operators' returns have declined. And that's the fundamental issue for the industry, is to reverse that. And all the conversations that we're having with major deepwater operators center around how they can improve their returns, and they all understand the importance of standardization. Not only does it improve execution, it lowers costs and lowers lead time. What's different this time is the determination by the operators to improve their returns, and recognition of standardization is one of the best ways to do it. We see evidence of this in the high-pressure, high-temperature 20,000-psi equipment that we are developing for 4 operators. That is unprecedented in our industry, that 4 operators would agree on a single standard, a single part number. And the impetus behind that is their conviction now, unlike in the past, to adopt industry standards. The conversations that we are having after our announcement of our alliance with Technip are similar in nature, where the operators are very interested in how we can introduce standards early in the design and concept process. So I think there's a real movement, if you will, to adopt standards in a way that has eluded the industry for several decades and we're now getting evidence of that. Again, high-pressure, high-temperature equipment is probably one of the best examples of 4 operators, and I think there's -- and there will be more to come that will adopt that standard."

Could you maybe break that cost savings out a little? Or how much, I guess, is from just lowering the time line of the deepwater project?"

So just looking at the scope, you'd expect both scope would find opportunities for reduction and it would come equally split from both pieces of the SPS scope and the SURF scope. So I think if you had to guess, it's probably just 50/50. But there are very specific ways that this alliance drives down cost. First, as I mentioned, the opportunity to introduce standards. When we're involved through the concept design stage, through the FEED capabilities of FMC and Technip, through the JV, Forsys, we'll be able to influence the standards that are established. We'll be able to, both Technip technology and FMC technology would be able to be introduced at the concept stage, which can significantly drive down cost. The other opportunity for reducing cost is the interface between these 2 critical scopes of subsea production systems and SURF. And this is in both our testing of this concept and these capabilities with past projects and projects we're currently evaluating for our partners. We found significant opportunities, again the 25% to 30% reduction range, by actually eliminating hardware at the interface between SPS and SURF installation. We've also found opportunities to more efficiently install the subsea equipment, including the production flow lines, because we're managing the interface between SPS and SURF in a combined manner. So right off the top of my head, more standardization, faster introduction to new technology, eliminating hardware at the interface between these 2 critical scopes and the opportunity for more efficient installation because the 2 pieces are being integrated."

But as John mentioned, a lot of that is really coming from the solid execution, the good work that's been done at these higher volumes and again, the early work on headcount this time. So we feel pretty confident about our full year margins in a range of 15%.

It -- on a run rate, it looks, for the first quarter, full year run rate, if we maintain that level and we absolutely expect that we will, it will mirror what we saw in 2014. So somewhere in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of subsea services makes up half of the $3 billion. Where does the rest come from? Some will come from smaller or less than $100 million orders. The first quarter inbound rate for those smaller orders was about half what we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that's the result of a bit of a stall or pause by the operators when they revise their budgets. There was a lot of distraction in that first quarter. They weren't ready to proceed with some of the smaller projects that were on their list because they needed to get their budgets sorted out. Although we did book several hundred million dollars of small awards in the first quarter, it was down from what we saw in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to get back up to more normal levels in future quarters.  And then as we said in the last call, this focus on returns, the downturn in our industry, the capital pullback by the operators, has caused them to evaluate and reassess their planned deepwater projects. And so we fully expect that these projects would move to the right and start to be awarded in the second half of the year.  We have been targeting several projects that we are highly confident will be awarded this year, and it's the combination of those larger projects that we have confidence in, an increase in the smaller projects that we didn't see in the first quarter and on the run rate for service, which we did see in the first quarter continuing, that gives us confidence that we'll at least do $3 billion for the year. In terms of projects and regions, again, all the projects are moving to the right as they're being reevaluated. Some of them will fall in 2015. Some will move into 2016. It's a little hard to predict right now where -- whether they'll land this year or move into next year.  In terms of regions, we're not looking for much in Brazil. As you know, Petrobras placed their big multiyear contracts several years ago, so we don't expect a lot of inbound necessarily in Brazil. We expect the Gulf of Mexico to continue to be strong. The big projects in West Africa, we just need to watch the timing because they have a -- will have a tendency to move to the right. So I'd say Brazil, a little softer. Gulf of Mexico should say strong. West Africa will depend on the timing of these big projects as they get awarded."

It makes us feel like the big backlog we've got, we're not showing margin deterioration. Now we know going forward, as you pointed out in the next 18 or so months, with the shift of major projects being awarded later in the year, 2015 being a softer year for Subsea inbound, that there'll probably be more pricing pressure just in terms of the competitive environment. So I'd see -- there clearly is the potential for some softening in margins, particularly it may be major projects that would be awarded.  Now remember at the same time, we are significantly reducing our costs, so the balance in the supply chain costs are also coming down. So how that actually plays out in terms of net margins to us, isn't clear yet. But we should expect that there's clearly a chance and opportunity that margins will become a little bit softer as we go through this slower period over the course of the next 9 to 12 months.

Actually, the combined SURF, SPS is the second-largest component of the deepwater development. Now what are the stumbling blocks? I mean the stumbling blocks, in my view, is really the industry willing to accept and adapt very different business models. It just doesn't make sense to me. It's illogical to think that we're going to get 30-plus-percent savings over a complete deepwater development without doing something fundamentally different. And that's what is so, I think, so attractive to the operators of the Forsys capabilities. They understand that we can't just keep doing things the same way we've always done them and then expect some huge material savings, at least in a sustainable way. And so the reaction that we've got since the announcement of Forsys has been, well, extraordinary. Virtually every one of our partners and some of our non-partners have asked to know a lot more about Forsys capabilities, including identifying specific projects that they would like to apply the Forsys capabilities to, to either improve their returns or make a project that was previously thought economic, now economic so they can proceed with the development. But they also recognize -- and I believe this time, they're prepared, the operators are prepared in conjunction with Technip and FMC, to try a different business model so we can exploit those potential savings. I think that's the biggest stumbling block is that sort of mind shift, if you will, or mind set to a different business model."

There's been conversations about maybe how we can reduce cost. That certainly -- particularly in maybe some of our service rates and that sort of thing.  But in almost every case the conversation is around how can we change the scope? How can we do something different to reduce the cost as opposed to straight pricing? So when it comes to the existing backlog -- and again, I'd point more to service work, the conversations have been around changing scope, doing things differently to reduce their cost, not necessarily pricing.  With regard to what happened in the -- every downturn is different. I don't -- I think it varies by projects. On our partner contracts, we tend to negotiate our contracts, which look very different than a tendered project. So Doug, I would just hesitate to put a number on what the pricing reduction is in a down cycle. It really varies. I don't think -- we saw softness in the last downturn, but we were also able to offset some of the softness through cost reduction. I think we have a unique position because of our alliances and our projects tend to be negotiated. So we don't have maybe as significant swings in pricing as you do when you have a major project that is tendered by 4 different suppliers, and the opportunity for 1 to maybe be more -- significantly more aggressive. So I'd say our pricing declines tend to be a little bit more stable and moderated in a downturn than maybe the industry as a whole."

But by and large, almost all of them are being questioned and reevaluated, if for no other reason, just in light in terms of the industry downturn, but others are being evaluated in terms of opportunities to do things, like the capabilities that come from the Forsys concept. There are some projects, however, a couple anyway in our list for 2015, I'll sort of leave it at a couple, that right now are probably uneconomic and would not successfully go through the FID process unless they are reworked. So those would not go forward unless they were successfully reworked. The rest are being reevaluated, but they're still economic. And I think the operators are looking for an opportunity to improve returns, either because of the market environment or some of these new approaches that are now -- at least, our company is presenting to them."

Several of those partners have actually identified candidates to proceed with applying the capabilities. We have also had conversations with non-partners who are interested in the concept. And they, too, have identified candidates at which we would apply the Forsys capabilities. So I think Forsys gives us the opportunity to strengthen the partnerships that we currently have and to potentially add new partners or expand our market position. I might mention though -- this isn't related to Forsys, but it is related to the idea of how our company can offer opportunities to improve returns. And that's back to the high-pressure, high-temperature equipment that we're building for the Gulf of Mexico. The 4 partner -- the 4 companies that are part of that consortium were also FMC partners. But we now have non-partners that are asking or considering, I should say, and they're actually well into the evaluation of whether or not they can participate in that consortium.

Lot of them have concentrated on the drilling side, on the geology side, on the downhole side, a lot of improvements on the fracking side. We believe there have been less efficiency step changes once the final frac is done and then you're selling your first barrel of oil. And I think that is a really ripe opportunity for the industry to demonstrate the same kind of efficiency improvements that the more upstream part of the process was already been able to achieve. FMC is uniquely positioned to drive those efficiencies because, not only are we providing the well head equipment, we're providing the frac rental equipment, we're providing the completion equipment and we're providing the flowback services. I don't think any other company has that combination of services. Today the operators are contracting each of those services and products out separately with separate crews. There's no opportunity to integrate those pieces in a cost-effective way, no opportunity to standardize. I understand every metering skid is unique to that particular pad. Their separation systems, whether it be temporary or permanent, are unique to that pad. There are tremendous opportunities for integration and standardization and bundling of services and products that really, no other company has that capability. Or if they do, they don't have the leadership position in those capabilities to pull that off. We've been working with several operators on either bundling these capabilities, providing standard equipment, introducing new technology for more efficient separation, for example. And we're very encouraged by the -- at least, the early signs of efficiency improvement, that we can get from that final frac to that first oil. That will give us a competitive advantage. I think it gives us a competitive advantage over other companies that don't have that suite of products and services."

Let me start, though, by describing the conversations we're having with our partners and actually, virtually every operator. The commitment by our partners and non-partners alike in terms of the developing their huge deepwater portfolios that they have been so successful at discovering, their commitment to development is completely unchanged. There's been no evidence that I've seen in these conversations that the operators have had any change with regard to their plans to develop their portfolio and deliver future production from deepwater. Virtually all the conversations are about how can we lower cost, do things different, improve returns so we can get on with developing our portfolio and delivering the production from our deepwater assets. So in that context, what the operators are doing is they're looking their long list of projects that they had originally planned 1.5 years ago, 2 years ago to go through FID process and award projects and proceed with the development. That long list for 2015 is being reevaluated. And those -- and the process of that reevaluation, which takes time, is pushing those projects to the right and that's one reason why you didn't see a lot of major projects, as are, certainly for us, major projects being awarded in the first quarter. That's why we believe that the projects that will be awarded this year are going to be pushed to the back end of 2015. There will be some projects that will move from 2015 into 2016, but this reevaluation process is a temporary stall or delay while they go through that reevaluation. Now the reevaluation doesn't take years. Eventually, these projects get reevaluated. They get back into the FID queue and you start seeing awards. You're going to see that in the second half this year. And then, as you get into 2015, you're going to get back to a more normal flow of subsea awards because they would've gone through this FID queue and they'll get back to their developing their project portfolio. I'm quite confident of that. Therefore, when you look at 2016 inbound, and I'm obviously way ahead of my skis predicting what 2016 inbound will look like, there's no reason to believe that it won't be higher than 2015, because you won't have this 6-month delay while they go through the reevaluation process. So absolutely, it should start to return to normal in 2016, as the operators are successful in reworking their projects."

Some will be awarded with or without the step change, as we've seen over the last few years. The step changes allow the operators to completely develop their entire portfolio of deepwater. I mean, there's over 400 deepwater discoveries that have yet to be developed. The pace of new discoveries versus projects that are being developed is greater and we need to get on -- the industry needs to get on with accelerating the development of their discoveries, and that's only going to happen with a step change. But the 2016, for example, and those year improvements in subsea awards is going to happen in part because of the step change and also independent of the step change, because those -- there are projects in that queue that are economic and can contribute to our customers' production without the step change. But ultimately, the industry needs to do a step change so they can develop all their projects in their portfolio."

With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter. Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.7 billion and operating profit was $216 million. Quarterly revenue from Subsea Technologies was $1.2 billion with margins up 14.8%. 
Our focus on execution and the strength of our backlog has continued to drive our strong margins. For the full year we still expect Subsea margins of around 15%. 
Our activity levels remain near our record 2014 levels, but our full year revenue will be down as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. Maryann will provide further detail on this currency impact.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound totaled $1 billion, bringing our total for the first half of the year to $1.6 billion. We recently received a $297 million BP Shah Deniz Stage 2 project award for manifolds and controls in Azerbaijan. This is the second major award we've received from BP for this development. 
Our second quarter Subsea orders also included awards for the long lead time materials for 2 large projects that we've been tracking. We expect full funding for these awards in the coming quarters. Second quarter value for each of these awards is relatively small, but the total value for each of these projects will be significant. 
Smaller project award activity increased sequentially, and subsea service activity remained strong during the quarter.
With year-to-date Subsea orders of $1.6 billion, we now have increased confidence in exceeding $3 billion of Subsea awards. This is supported by the continued strength in our service activity, increasing small order inbound and some large projects we expect to book before year-end.
Our customers remain committed to developing their deepwater portfolios and continue to evaluate their offshore projects for upcoming development. Some of these are in advanced stages and are set to move forward with minimal changes to their original plan. The design and scope of many projects, however, our being significantly reworked to reduce cost and improve project economics. Operators are showing a willingness to accept alternative approaches to the traditional tendering process and are much more open to our vendor-based solutions. 
As offshore projects make up a large part of the future production of many operators, the achievement of improved project economics is imperative. Our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, which became operational in June, provides a meaningful and immediate step change in project economics. The initial response received from operators, both partners and nonpartners alike, has exceeded our expectations. This includes IOCs, NOCs and independent operators. The potential fields are in basins throughout the world, and the scope of the projects varies from tiebacks to greenfield developments. The rate at which our clients have identified projects in their portfolios as strong candidates for FEED and concept design using Forsys Subsea capabilities demonstrates the importance of this new approach. The pace and breadth of their commitment gives us confidence of at least 1 award in 2015 and that the first related EPCI award will come next year. 
In our Surface Technologies segment, revenue decreased 19% sequentially as we experienced significant declines in North America activity in the second quarter, consistent with the 35% sequential U.S. rig count decline and the impact of Canadian breakup. More than 1,000 rigs have come out in the market in the last 3 quarters. In response, customer spending reductions have been significant, and price reductions have had a greater impact in us than in prior down cycles.
Our daily fluid control orders fell dramatically in the quarter. We do not expect material changes to this level in the third quarter, and it's unlikely we'll see much recovery before 2016.
As we implement our integrated strategy for our North America business, we continue to consolidate many of our bases and rationalize our workforce to improve our overall operating effectiveness. Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continues to perform very well. We continue to forecast strong activity through the remainder of the year but remain vigilant, and we'll react swiftly should we see prolonged market weakness.
Looking forward, the North America landmark that will remain challenged going into 2016. We're taking actions to consolidate many of our operations within this segment. This will make us a stronger, more integrated business with greater capabilities and a lower cost structure. 
We remain confident in our ability to deliver full year Subsea margins of around 15%. We will continue to right size our Subsea organization in line with our improved efficiencies and anticipated activity levels while protecting our market leadership. 
Deepwater assets continue to be a significant part of many operators' portfolios. As project reevaluations move forward, new approaches are beginning to emerge that improve overall project economics. These are placing a greater reliance on vendor-based solutions and integrated field design and development. We expect this will help the positive order momentum that began in the second quarter continue through the second half of 2015 and into next year. 
Maryann will now take us through some of the financial details for the quarter."
972117,292080953,835644,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2015",2015-07-22,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I'd like to note that our quarterly earnings results were negatively impacted by total company restructuring charges in the quarter of $0.03 per diluted share and an IRS tax settlement charge of $0.03 per dilu",1086,"Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I'd like to note that our quarterly earnings results were negatively impacted by total company restructuring charges in the quarter of $0.03 per diluted share and an IRS tax settlement charge of $0.03 per diluted share. Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver strong operating results. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue would have increased by $62 million year-over-year. Subsea Technologies operating profit of $184 million in the -- was $184 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total operating profit would have increased $15 million year-over-year. 
Operating margins were 14.8%. We incurred restructuring cost of $5.4 million in the quarter. Excluding these costs, margins were 15.2%, a sequentially improvement of 60 basis points from the first quarter. These results are driven by our solid execution of a strong project backlog and the continued strength of subsea service activity despite weaker activity in the North Sea. Although our activity remains high, we were able to reduce further our Subsea headcount during the quarter in areas where our internal standardization efforts have delivered efficiency improvements.
In the coming quarters, workforce reductions will be more reflective of the anticipated decrease in future year activity due to delayed Subsea project inbound. We anticipate an additional $15 million to $20 million of charges in the second half of the year. Further headcount reductions will be made to support future activity levels. 
Given the international composition of Subsea, we have experienced continued headwinds of the strong U.S. dollar. In the first half of 2015, the U.S. dollar is significantly stronger than currencies we have the greatest exposure to, , euro and the real. Subsea revenue for the first 6 months of 2015 includes a $251 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue increased by $117 million year-over-year. Operating profit included a $35 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit increased $52 million.
Moving to Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies operating profit for the second quarter was $28 million with a margin of 7.5%. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $2.8 million. Excluding these costs, margins were 8.3%. These results are reflective of the severe slowdown we are seeing in all of our North American land businesses. The sequential drop also includes the impact of Canadian breakup. We have now largely completed the planned headcount reductions associated with the lower activity levels. As John stated, we do not expect to see much recovery before next year. Therefore, our overall U.S. activity is likely to be lower in the second half of the year when compared with the first half. We expect some of this decline to be offset by improvements in our completion services business, which will benefit from increased activity in Canada as we come out of breakup. 
As we have been discussing, we are in the process of reducing our operating cost structure in North America while integrated-related services on the pad. We expect these actions to continue throughout the remainder of the year and will result in further headcount reductions. These actions will reduce costs and improve our competitive position as market recovers. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to perform well, primarily related to activity in the Middle East offset by some volume decline in Europe. 
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $467 million. This is predominantly surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Energy Infrastructure operating income for the second quarter was $5 million with a margin of 5.2%. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $1.3 million. Excluding this costs, margins were 6.5%. We experienced sequential improvement in our loading systems business, but it was partially offset by weakness in our measurement solutions business due to slower activity. We expect segment margins to approach double digits in the back half of the year due to loading systems continued improvement and somewhat higher activity levels from measurement.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million. We expect spending of approximately $15 million per quarter throughout 2015. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $30 million. The majority of the higher-than-forecast expense relates to foreign currency losses primarily associated with the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Given the potential for future devaluation of the kwanza, it is possible we will incur further losses in the second half of the year. 
For the remainder of 2015, we expect other revenue and expense to be approximately $14 million per quarter of expense with a potential for further foreign currency fluctuations increasing that amount. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 34.1%. This includes a U.S. tax adjustment of $8 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to an IRS audit settlement for years 2007 through 2011. Excluding this, our tax rate would have been 29%. We continue to expect our 2015 full year tax rate to be between 25% and 27%, which includes the U.S. tax audit settlement. 
Capital spending this quarter was $75 million. We expect capital spending in 2015 of approximately $250 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $699 million. It was comprised of $587 million of cash and $1.3 million of debt. We averaged 233 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the second quarter at an average cost of $41.62 per share. 
Looking forward, Energy Infrastructure revenue will be down at least 20% year-over-year with full year margins in the mid to high single digits, negatively impacted by the results in the first half of the year and slower activity in our measurement systems business. Surface Technologies revenue will be down at least 25% from last year due to reduced North America market activity and continued pricing pressure. Full year operating margins should be approximately 12%, excluding severance cost. Subsea revenue for the full year should be approximately $4.8 billion. We continue to expect Subsea margins of around 15% as service activity levels remain high and we continue to execute well on our backlog. 
The current market conditions are presenting a number of challenges to our near-term results. However, the strategies we are implementing across our businesses will result in long-term cost savings while preserving our capability to improve our execution as the market recovers.

You may remember during the last down cycle, we were in the process of actually growing our headcount to prepare for growth. In this cycle, actually, we begun our reduction of workforce heading into this cycle. So another positive. You've seen growth in our subsea services for the last several quarters. And then lastly, as we have demonstrated, our execution continues to improve. All of those things will work quite well for us. Standardization and all the internal work that we have done, if you will, to rationalize the workforce as well as standardize our own internal portfolio will help that as well.

So we'll still be rolling off a lot of that well-priced backlog into '16. Later in 2016 and beginning into '17 is when you really see the impact of that lower margin. And by then we're quite hopeful that all the additional cost structure and work that we're doing, all of the work within Subsea and the internal standardization will help us offset that as well.

So those conversations are happening as in the normal course, again, with partners and nonpartners alike. The other obvious thing that's happening, I'd like to ask Doug to give more specific commentary on the actual discussions, is the introduction of Forsys. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the reaction by partners, nonpartners, large, small independents, even NOCs, the reaction to the Forsys concept has really exceeded our expectations. And so it's true. That mechanism we're also seeing the operators engage with us on the ways that we can accelerate new technology adoption, drive standards, which has been a challenge for the industry, and then there's new business models through Forsys. So I'll ask Doug to talk -- we've had a couple of really very specific conversations with a whole variety of operators, particularly around the Forsys concept, and I think that might illustrate the operators' reaction to change.

We closed in early June, and we're now actively engaging with our clients. And as John said, it's a wide breadth of clients, both partners, nonpartners IOCs, NOCs and independent operators. And as a result of that, we've entered into discussions deep within their organizations where they've actually assigned teams to work along our teams to look at ways to work differently. This means not only the Subsea field architecture and the installation of that architecture, but also the way that we look at the life of the field and how we look at production over the life of the field and therefore, how we design the upfront equipment and how we introduce sensors and monitoring as a result of that. But what's really quite intriguing is we'll often go in prepared to talk about a particular project or a particular opportunity. And before the meeting is over, we've had on more than one occasion the customer introduce to us a portfolio of projects. And these are those projects that have been, if you will, on the cusp or just slightly outside of the -- the project economics have been just outside of the threshold to move those projects forward, and they're now introducing that portfolio and saying, look, if this can work, we have multiple projects that we'd like to conduct under this manner.

When you think of any industry, particularly our industry, attempting to go through a major step change in how we do business, it seems like it requires certain things. First of all, it requires the business imperative, which now we have not just because of the oil prices but because of the planning returns so there's a sense of urgency, there's a business imperative to make change. And we've talked about that before. It can't be incremental change to improve the returns. It has to be significant, material, and they have to be sustainable. So the industry, it has that imperative because of the declining returns. The second, I think, important thing is that the solution to drive a step change, it has to be real. It has to be tangible and it has to be compelling. And the Forsys Subsea change in business model is very much that. And then thirdly, if you're going to make a step change, it has to be relatively simple to implement something. That's compounded or just complex and convoluted is going to be very difficult for an industry to make that kind of a step change. And then finally, and this is ultimately maybe the most important thing. If you ask an industry to go through make a significant step change that requires a leap of faith and the leap of faith requires some level of trust. And so when I think when Terry and the team talk to operators, it is a full range and I was actually surprise that of all oil companies, national oil companies, are even interested in that But large, small, it sees 4 elements that end up in the conversation that almost always ends up around trust. And you're right, given the relationships that we've built at all levels in the organization through our partnerships and nonpartnerships, there's a great deal of trust there. And I think we're capitalizing on that as we have this conversation about how to make a step change. What is especially interesting, and Doug alluded to it, it's not uncommon when we approach an operator that very quickly we get beyond the interest and intrigue into this new concept and fairly quickly, in the course of even the initial meeting, we're talking about specific projects. And as Doug said, we go from specific projects to the entire portfolio. What we've also seen, to the degree it's being is unexpected, very quickly we go from the sea level conversation in the high-level vectors to assigning a joint project team to pursue applying this concept to a likely candidate from their portfolio. So very quickly, we're getting -- and this is especially true of the smaller independents who don't have all those layers. Very quickly we get to a project team with the operator joined with ours pursuing that with the direction from the sea level. So we've actually been pretty impressed, especially with smaller independents even some that have been of ours, of how quickly they've been able to influence and convince the levels below them to seriously look at this concept. Now a larger operator with many, many more levels, maybe a larger Subsea organization that has to be convinced, I don't think we're naïve. We know it's going to take more of an effort. But one of the things that's different here, though, again is either in sea level and below, they're going beyond the interest and they're naming projects, and I think that will be one of the keys. Doug, do you want to add to that based on your more specific experience on some of these conversations?"

This -- it's there. We're not naive. We recognize it's there. But there's been much less resistance than we had expected to experience. And even with the large operators, we're sitting there talking about fields and again, portfolios of opportunities that they're anxious to move forward now that there's a solution, and as John said, the commercial model, although it's different, because of the combination of our 2 companies and the breadth of our 2 companies in the offering and the simplicity in the commercial model, they're wanting to embrace data and taking the necessary actions to do so."

In addition to that, obviously, we're trying to drive new business, new commercial models through Forsys Subsea. We have several examples, several examples of where we're working with our customers right now as they either reengineer projects that had not moved forward given the current economics and/or new projects including both including tiebacks and greenfields. And we're going through these, if you will, these 4 steps to drive and improve the overall Subsea project economics with the overall objective of, obviously, creating more market and moving those projects forward. We continue to see savings in the range that we had previously indicated and that you indicated.

So Dave, let's talk about the balance of 2015 and why we have confidence in exceeding the $3 billion. So obviously, we had a strong Q2. You had Q1 and Q2 together, $1.6 billion.

So obviously, we had a strong Q2. You had Q1 and Q2 together, $1.6 billion. We're over halfway to our target of $3 billion. What gives us the confidence? We said in the last quarter that we were pleased with the subsea service activity in the first quarter. It sort of mirrored the run rates that we have in 2014. We thought it would hold up. It did hold up in the second quarter. Second quarter subsea service numbers were equivalent, actually a little bit better than the first quarter numbers. It's 2 questers in a narrow, and it's downturn of subsea service inbound holding up, that gives us confidence. 
The second thing is the small, less than $100 million orders. In the first quarter, they were down substantially from our run rate in 2014. In the second quarter, they bounced back fairly significantly sequentially, and they start to mirror the small order inbound that we got in 2013 and 2014. And we hope that, that was the case. I think in the first quarter call, we said that we thought the low number on smaller orders was a result of the operators kind of stopping everything while they re-did their budgets, and we were hopeful that, that would come back of this year. And sure enough, it did in Q2. So we expect that number to be stronger going forward. Obviously, winning the shot on each project was important to us, and we had counted on that. We were tracking a handful of other projects, some of which we expect to be inbounded in 2015. 
Winning 2 major projects, long lead, time material is really important to us. That means those projects are likely to go ahead and it means that we're going to win. Now when they actually fall, they could move into '16. But that gives us a lot of confidence that we'll pick up the couple of projects we need for the balance of the year, and therefore, now we have more confidence that's we'll exceed the $3 billion target that we put out there. So that's 2015. Now going into 2016, it's what you alluded to. The long list of projects, over $7 billion of major projects, have been identified for 2015 before the downturn. Those have all now been deferred -- many of them, not all, but many of them have been deferred and they're being reworked. We expect that rework, which is happening fairly fast, and hopefully in part, even due to the efforts that we're working with our partners whether it's Forsys or non-Forsys to improve those economics that those start to move forward. And we should start seeing that move forward the balance of 2015 into 2016, and we start to ramp back up at some point to the historical numbers of Subsea developments that we saw in the past. We know that the discoveries are there. We know the fields are there, the portfolios are there. The question is how fast can the operators adopt some of these new concepts, rework their scope of these development projects and get back to the pace that we saw in 2013 and 2014. But we expect that to start picking up in 2016. I'm not saying the 2016 inbound level will replicate '13 or '14, but we ought to see some sort of ramp-up as backlog of projects go through the rework process, go to the FID process and turn into awards."

We have a strong position. The Gulf of Mexico, the projects are smaller. They don't cut as much into the capital budgets. These usually have better economics because they're tying back to existing infrastructure. They happen faster because national oil companies aren't involved in production sharing contract, bidding process. So yes, I think the smaller projects bounced back first because they're generally Gulf of Mexico related, and they don't have -- they're are smaller so their capital demands are less and the lead times are faster. So yes, I guess when you think about it that way, they would come back faster. The bigger projects are going to come back as they're being more related to the pace of rework.

The first is thanks to you guys I now know that the Angolan kwanza devalued by 6% in June. I was not aware of that before. But the black market suggests that it could devalue a whole lot more as you alluded to in your comments. But could you help us understand, if it does indeed trade down to the 190 level that the black market is trading to, what's the financial impact on you? What steps can you take to protect against that as we think about the corporate? So that's question number 1. And question number 2 is simpler, I guess. Accounts receivable were up a fair amount in Q2. What is your thoughts around -- was that related to 1 big customer? What are your thoughts around working that back down as we might have expected in the second half of the year?"

So with respect to the kwanza, we have a couple of opportunities to protect against that sort of going forward, but you're right and hence, that's why I made a comment that there is some risk given the dependence on oil price and oil revenues to that economy. We are protected largely until the time at which we actually build. So we have sort of 2 elements of risk: 1 is the receivable risk, and we have been and continue to be talking with our customers. Much of our contractual language gives us relief and protection. Some of our customers we have actually been able to reach good conclusion with, others we are still in the process. So customer discussions to protect that, in other words once again have to invoice some kwanza as you know from the wall change in 2013. And so that's where the risk exists and further devaluation as we're waiting from payments. Once we get payment, of course, then we have the cash risk. So our opportunities in there, in addition to working with our customers to protect us so that neither one of us are on fairly penalized, if you will, is looking at opportunities to invest in country that is a challenge, but we're looking very hard at being able to do that. So we would have some interest income to offset any potential. And then most importantly is to minimize the amount of assets sitting in country. At that point in time, we happen to be sitting with a fairly large receivable position, which is why happened. So we are also looking at good measures for us to be able to minimize the amount of kwanza that we have sitting there. There is a forward market for kwanza, but it's about a 3-month market, and it's on average about 40% cost was. So heretofore, we have made the conscious decision not to do that. And we think, obviously, so far that has been the right decision. So customer discussions, movement of cash, reinvestment of cash and obviously doing everything we can to amount of cash that's sitting out there. On the receivables question, no, nothing in particular. We are moving a lot of projects into final execution phase. So we have no concerns over any receivable risk whatsoever. This is just normal business as we would have expected. No risk here at all."

Just to reiterate what John said, there's really 4 components that are required to successfully transform a business model or to introduce new commercial model.

The pressure on pricing and what we've had to accept across the board, surface, fluid control, completion services, has been much more severe than we saw in the past. And I think you're right, it's the severity and the steepness and the speed in which downturn occurred drove much more aggressive pricing pressure, and that's what made this cycle different than the past and why our Q2 numbers were disappointing from what we thought they would be. As Maryann pointed out, we're taking action. We didn't anticipate the cycle to be different now as it is. We're going through another around of restructuring.

We're putting in place very structural and sustainable changes to the way we operate our business in North America. As you know, we have 3 primary businesses in North America, and they worked somewhat autonomously in the past, servicing their individual portions of the markets. We think there's real value in the integration of those services, and that's why we made the acquisitions we made a couple of years back to really fulfill the requirements to be able to offer that full integrated solutions. So we call that surface integrated solutions, and that's our North America business. And as we discussed last quarter and John just alluded to, the transformation of that is underway. Our SIS offering provides a unique combination of surface products and services, providing our customers the benefit of accelerated time to sales and optimized flow rates. We're progressing well with the necessary operational and structural changes to enable the offering. And in the quarter, as we indicated, we took structural charges related to not only the severe drop in activity, as John pointed out, but also because we have the opportunity now to optimize our operating footprint. So we've had several base closures and also additional headcount reductions associated with a leaner, flatter organization. And then finally, we're shifting our supply chain to more optimal cost base, which will provide even additional benefits. so we're confident that these tactical actions, along with the enhanced commercial model or this integrated approach, will yield elevated and sustainable results. The full benefit of which -- we won't begin to see the full benefit until 2016. But as Maryann pointed out, some of the more tactical steps that we're taking, we'll see the benefit in the second half of this year."

With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter, Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.7 billion and operating profit was $216 million. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.2 billion, with margins up 14.8%.  Our focus on execution and the strength of our backlog has continued to drive our strong margins. For the full year we still expect subsea margins of around 15%. 
Our activity levels remain near our record 2014 levels, but our full year revenue will be down as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. Maryann will provide further detail on this currency impact.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound totaled $1 billion, bringing our total for the first half of the year to $1.6 billion. We recently received a $297 million BP Shah Deniz Stage 2 project award for manifolds and controls in Azerbaijan. This is the second major award we received from BP for this development. 
Our second quarter subsea orders also included awards for the long lead time materials for 2 large projects that we've been tracking. We expect full funding for these awards in the coming quarters. Second quarter value for each of these awards is relatively small, but the total value for each of these projects will be significant. 
Smaller project award activity increased sequentially, and subsea service activity remained strong during the quarter.
With year-to-date subsea orders of $1.6 billion, we now have increased confidence in exceeding $3 billion of subsea awards. This is supported by the continued strength in our service activity, increasing small order inbound and some large projects we expect to book before year-end.
Our customers remain committed to developing their deepwater portfolios and continue to evaluate their offshore projects for upcoming development. Some of these are in advanced stages and are set to move forward with minimal changes to their original plans. The design and scope of many projects, however, are being significantly reworked to reduce cost and improve project economics. Operators are showing a willingness to accept alternative approaches to the traditional tendering process and are much more open to our vendor-based solutions. 
As offshore projects make up a large part of the future production of many operators, the achievement of improved project economics is imperative. Our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, which became operational in June, provides a meaningful and immediate step change in project economics. The initial response received from operators, both partners and non-partners alike, has exceeded our expectations. This includes IOCs, NOCs and independent operators. The potential fields are in basins throughout the world, and the scope of the projects varies from tiebacks to greenfield developments. The rate at which our clients have identified projects in their portfolios as strong candidates for FEED and concept design using Forsys Subsea capabilities demonstrates the importance of this new approach. The pace and breadth of their commitment gives us confidence of at least 1 award in 2015 and that the first related EPCI award will come next year. 
In our Surface Technologies segment, revenue decreased 19% sequentially as we experienced significant declines in North America activity in the second quarter, consistent with the 35% sequential U.S. rig count decline and the impact of Canadian breakup. More than 1,000 rigs have come out of the market in the last 3 quarters. In response, customer spending reductions have been significant, and price reductions have had a greater impact on us than in prior down cycles.
Our daily fluid control orders fell dramatically in the quarter. We do not expect material changes to this level in the third quarter, and it's unlikely we'll see much recovery before 2016.
As we implement our integrated strategy for our North America business, we continue to consolidate many of our bases and rationalize our workforce to improve our overall operating effectiveness. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continues to perform very well. We continue to forecast strong activity through the remainder of the year but remain vigilant, and we'll react swiftly should we see prolonged market weakness.
Looking forward, the North America landmark will remain challenged going into 2016. We're taking actions to consolidate many of our operations within this segment. This will make us a stronger, more integrated business with greater capabilities and a lower cost structure. 
We remain confident in our ability to deliver full year subsea margins of around 15%. We will continue to right size our subsea organization in line with our improved efficiencies and anticipated activity levels while protecting our market leadership. 
Deepwater assets continue to be a significant part of many operators' portfolios. As project reevaluations move forward, new approaches are beginning to emerge that improve overall project economics. These are placing a greater reliance on vendor-based solutions and integrated field design and development. We expect this will help the positive order momentum that began in the second quarter continue through the second half of 2015 and into next year. 
Maryann will now take us through some of the financial details for the quarter."
972117,292080953,835825,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2015",2015-07-22,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I'd like to note that our quarterly earnings results were negatively impacted by total company restructuring charges in the quarter of $0.03 per diluted share and an IRS tax settlement charge of $0.03 per dilu",1086,"Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I'd like to note that our quarterly earnings results were negatively impacted by total company restructuring charges in the quarter of $0.03 per diluted share and an IRS tax settlement charge of $0.03 per diluted share. 
Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver strong operating results. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue would have increased by $62 million year-over-year. Subsea Technologies operating profit of $184 million in the -- was $184 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total operating profit would have increased $15 million year-over-year. 
Operating margins were 14.8%. We incurred restructuring cost of $5.4 million in the quarter. Excluding these costs, margins were 15.2%, a sequential improvement of 60 basis points from the first quarter. These results are driven by our solid execution of a strong project backlog and the continued strength of subsea service activity despite weaker activity in the North Sea. Although our activity remains high, we were able to reduce further our subsea headcount during the quarter in areas where our internal standardization efforts have delivered efficiency improvements.  In the coming quarters, workforce reductions will be more reflective of the anticipated decrease in future year activity due to delayed subsea project inbound. We anticipate an additional $15 million to $20 million of charges in the second half of the year. Further headcount reductions will be made to support future activity levels. 
Given the international composition of subsea, we have experienced continued headwinds of the strong U.S. dollar. In the first half of 2015, the U.S. dollar is significantly stronger than currencies we have the greatest exposure to, nok, euro and the real. Subsea revenue for the first 6 months of 2015 includes a $251 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue increased by $117 million year-over-year. Operating profit included a $35 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit increased $52 million.
Moving to Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies operating profit for the second quarter was $28 million with a margin of 7.5%. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $2.8 million. Excluding these costs, margins were 8.3%. These results are reflective of the severe slowdown we are seeing in all of our North American land businesses. The sequential drop also includes the impact of Canadian breakup. We have now largely completed the planned headcount reductions associated with the lower activity levels. As John stated, we do not expect to see much recovery before next year. Therefore, our overall U.S. activity is likely to be lower in the second half of the year when compared with the first half. We expect some of this decline to be offset by improvement in our completion services business, which will benefit from increased activity in Canada as we come out of breakup. 
As we have been discussing, we are in the process of reducing our operating cost structure in North America while integrated related services on the pad. We expect these actions to continue throughout the remainder of the year and will result in further headcount reductions. These actions will reduce cost and improve our competitive position as market recovers. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to perform well, primarily related to activity in the Middle East, offset by some volume decline in Europe. 
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $467 million. This is predominantly surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Energy Infrastructure operating income for the second quarter was $5 million, with a margin of 5.2%. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring cost of $1.3 million. Excluding this cost, margins were 6.5%. We experienced sequential improvement in our Loading Systems business, but it was partially offset by weakness in our measurement solutions business due to slower activity. We expect segment margins to approach double digits in the back half of the year due to Loading Systems' continued improvement and somewhat higher activity levels from measurement.
Let's turn to the corporate items. 
Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million. We expect spending of approximately $15 million per quarter throughout 2015. 
Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $30 million. The majority of the higher-than-forecast expense relates to foreign currency losses, primarily associated with the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Given the potential for future devaluation of the kwanza, it is possible we will incur further losses in the second half of the year. 
For the remainder of 2015, we expect other revenue and expense to be approximately $14 million per quarter of expense, with a potential for further foreign currency fluctuations increasing that amount. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 34.1%. This includes a U.S. tax adjustment of $8 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to an IRS audit settlement for years 2007 through 2011. Excluding this, our tax rate would have been 29%. We continue to expect our 2015 full year tax rate to be between 25% and 27%, which includes the U.S. tax audit settlement. 
Capital spending this quarter was $75 million. We expect capital spending in 2015 of approximately $250 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $699 million. It was comprised of $587 million of cash and $1.3 million of debt. We averaged 233 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the second quarter at an average cost of $41.62 per share. 
Looking forward, Energy Infrastructure revenue will be down at least 20% year-over-year, with full year margins in the mid- to high-single digits, negatively impacted by the results in the first half of the year and slower activity in our measurement systems business. Surface Technologies revenue will be down at least 25% from last year due to reduced North America market activity and continued pricing pressure. Full year operating margins should be approximately 12%, excluding severance cost. Subsea revenue for the full year should be approximately $4.8 billion. We continue to expect subsea margins of around 15% as service activity levels remain high and we continue to execute well on our backlog. 
The current market conditions are presenting a number of challenges to our near-term results. However, the strategies we are implementing across our businesses will result in long-term cost savings while preserving our capability to improve our execution as the market recovers.

As we look back at prior cycles, this cycle looks very different than it has in the past. So first of all, we're coming off of a very solid well-priced backlog in this cycle versus last. You may remember during the last down cycle, we were in the process of actually growing our headcount to prepare for growth. In this cycle, actually, we've begun our reduction of workforce heading into this cycle. So another positive. You've seen growth in our subsea services for the last several quarters. And then lastly, as we have demonstrated, our execution continues to improve. All of those things will work quite well for us. Standardization and all the internal work that we have done, if you will, to rationalize the workforce as well as standardize our own internal portfolio will help that as well. All of those things give us confidence in our ability to maintain those margins this year. Clearly, next year, we'll have some struggle at maintaining a 15% margin, obviously, because of pricing. But we are very confident that we will not see the level of margin this cycle that we did last. So we will not see single-digit margins next cycle."

So we'll still be rolling off a lot of that well-priced backlog into '16. Later in 2016 and beginning into '17 is when you really see the impact of that lower margin. And by then, we're quite hopeful that all the additional cost structuring work that we're doing, all of the work within subsea and the internal standardization, will help us offset that as well.

So those conversations are happening as in just the normal course, again, with partners and non-partners alike. The other obvious thing that's happening, I'd like to ask Doug to give more specific commentary on the actual discussions, is the introduction of Forsys. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the reaction by partners, non-partners, large, small independents, even NOCs, the reaction to the Forsys concept has really exceeded our expectations. And so it's through that mechanism we're also seeing the operators engage with us on the ways that we can accelerate new technology adoption, drive standards, which has been a challenge for the industry, and then there's new business models through Forsys. So I'll ask Doug to talk -- we've had a couple of really very specific conversations with a whole variety of operators, particularly around the Forsys concept, and I think that might illustrate the operators' reaction to change.

Yes, Bill, very interesting meetings that we've had as a result of the Forsys Subsea announcement and introduction to the market. We closed in early June, and we're now actively engaging with our clients. And as John said, it's a wide breadth of clients, both partners, non-partners IOCs, NOCs and independent operators. And as a result of that, we've entered into discussions deep within their organizations where they've actually assigned teams to work along our teams to look at ways to work differently. This means not only the subsea field architecture and the installation of that architecture, but also the way that we look at the life of the field and how we look at production over the life of the field, and therefore, how we design the upfront equipment and how we introduce sensors and monitoring as a result of that. But what's really quite intriguing is we'll often go in prepared to talk about a particular project or a particular opportunity. And before the meeting is over, we've had, on more than one occasion, the customer introduce to us a portfolio of projects. And these are those projects that have been, if you will, on the cusp or just slightly outside of the -- the project economics have been just outside of the threshold to move those projects forward, and they're now introducing that portfolio and saying, ""Look, if this can work, we have multiple projects that we'd like to conduct under this manner."" Now this does mean a change of commercial behavior, and in any organization there's resistance to changes to commercial behavior, but we're seeing a very quick and early uptake and willingness to move forward and operate in a different manner."

Let me kind of hopefully not digress, but sort of set the stage. When you think of any industry, particularly our industry, attempting to go through a major step change in how we do business, it seems like it requires certain things. First of",650,"Thanks, Ole. Let me kind of hopefully not digress, but sort of set the stage. When you think of any industry, particularly our industry, attempting to go through a major step change in how we do business, it seems like it requires certain things. First of all, it requires the business imperative, which now we have, not just because of low oil prices but because of declining returns. So there's a sense of urgency, there's a business imperative to make change. And we've talked about that before. It can't be incremental change to improve the returns. It has to be -- they have to be significant, material, and they have to be sustainable. So the industry, it has that imperative because of the declining returns. The second, I think, important thing is that the solution to make -- drives the step change, it has to be real, it has to be tangible and it has to be compelling. And the Forsys Subsea change in business model is very much that. And then thirdly, if you're going to make a step change, it has to be relatively simple to implement. Something that's compounded or just complex and convoluted is going to be very difficult for an industry to make that kind of step change. And then finally, and this, ultimately, may be the most important thing. If you ask an industry to go through -- make a significant step change that requires a leap of faith and the leap of faith requires some level of trust. And so when I think of -- when Terry [ph] and I and the team talk to operators, and again, as Doug described, it is the full range. And I was actually surprise that of all oil companies, national oil companies, are even interested in that. But large, small, it's these 4 elements that end up in the conversation that almost always ends up around trust. And you're right, given the relationships that we've built at all levels in the organization through our partnerships and non-partnerships, there's a great deal of trust there, and I think we're capitalizing on that as we have this conversation about how to make a step change. What is especially interesting, and Doug alluded to it, it's not uncommon when we approach an operator that very quickly, we get beyond the interest and intrigue into this new concept, and fairly quickly, in the course of even the initial meeting, we're talking about specific projects. And as Doug said, we go from specific projects to the entire portfolio. What we've also seen happen, I think was -- well, to the degree it's being adopted is unexpected -- very quickly, we go from the C-level conversation and the high-level directors to assigning a joint project team to pursue applying this concept to a likely candidate from their portfolio. So very quickly, we're getting -- and this is especially true of the smaller independents who don't have all those layers. Very quickly, we get to a project team with the operator joined with ours pursuing that with the direction from the C-level. So we've actually been pretty impressed, especially with smaller independents, even some that have been non-partners of ours, of how quickly they've been able to influence and convince the levels below them to seriously look at this concept. Now a larger operator with many, many more levels, maybe a larger subsea organization that has to be convinced, I don't think we're naïve. We know that it's going to take more of an effort. But one of the things that -- is different here, though, again is even at C-level and below, they're going beyond the interest and intrigue and they're naming projects, and I think that will be one of the keys. Doug, do you want to add to that based on your more specific experience on some of these conversations?"

This -- it's there. We're not naive. We recognize it's there. But there's been much less resistance than we had expected to experience. And even with the large operators. We're sitting there talking about fields and, again, portfolios of opportunities that they're anxious to move forward now that there's a solution. And as John said, the commercial model, although it's different, because of the combination of our 2 companies and the breadth of our 2 companies and the offering and the simplicity in the commercial model, they're wanting to embrace that and taking the necessary actions to do so."

We have several examples, several examples of where we're working with our customers right now as they either reengineer projects that had not moved forward given the current economics and/or new projects including both tiebacks and greenfields. And we're going through these, if you will, these 4 steps to drive and improve the overall Subsea project economics with the overall objective of, obviously, creating more market and moving those projects forward.

So obviously, we had a strong Q2. You add Q1 and Q2 together, $1.6 billion. We're over halfway to our target of $3 billion. What gives us the confidence? We said in the last quarter that we were pleased with the subsea service activity in the first quarter. It sort of mirrored the run rates that we have in 2014. We thought it would hold up. It did hold up in the second quarter. Second quarter subsea service numbers were equivalent, actually a little bit better than the first quarter numbers. It's 2 quarters in a row, and it's downturn of subsea service inbound holding up, that gives us confidence.  The second thing is the small, less than $100 million orders. In the first quarter, they were down substantially from our run rate in 2014. In the second quarter, they bounced back fairly significantly sequentially, and they start to mirror the small order inbound that we got in 2013 and 2014. And we hope that, that was the case. I think in the first quarter call, we said that we thought the low number on small orders was a result of the operators kind of stopping everything while they re-did their budgets, and we were hopeful that, that would come back this year. And sure enough, it did in Q2. So we expect that number to be stronger going forward. Obviously, winning the shot in each project was important to us, and we had counted on that. We were tracking a handful of other projects that we, some of which, we expect to be inbounded in 2015. 
Winning 2 major projects, long lead, time material is really important to us. That means those projects are likely to go ahead and it means that we're going to win them. Now when they actually fall, they could move into '16, but that gives us a lot of confidence. So we'll pick up the couple of projects we need for the balance of the year, and therefore, now, we have more confidence that we'll exceed the $3 billion target that we put out there. So that's 2015. Now going into 2016, it's what you alluded to. The long list of projects, over $7 billion of major projects, have been identified for 2015 before the downturn. Those have all now been deferred -- many of them have been, not all, but many of them have been deferred and they're being reworked. We expect that rework, which is happening fairly fast, and hopefully in part, even due to the efforts that we're working with our partners, whether it's Forsys or non-Forsys, to improve those economics, that those start to move forward. And we should start seeing that move forward, balance of 2015 into 2016, and we start to ramp back up at some point to the historical numbers of Subsea developments that we saw in the past. We know that the discoveries are there. We know the fields are there, the portfolios are there. The question is, how fast can the operators adopt some of these new concepts, rework their scope of these development projects and get back to the pace that we saw in 2013 and 2014. But we expect that to start picking up in 2016. I'm not saying the 2016 inbound level will replicate '13 or '14, but we ought to see some sort of ramp-up, this backlog of projects go through the rework process, go to the FID process and turn into awards."

One reason why we saw the Q2 bump up in smaller projects, not surprisingly, they were in the Gulf of Mexico and many of them were our partners. We have a lot of partners in the Gulf of Mexico. We have a strong position. The Gulf of Mexico, the projects are smaller. They don't cut as much into the capital budgets. They usually have better economics because they're tying back to existing infrastructure. They happen faster because national oil companies aren't involved in production sharing contract, bidding process. So yes, I think the smaller projects bounce back first because they're generally Gulf of Mexico-related and they don't have -- they're smaller, so their capital demands are less and the lead times are faster. So yes, I guess when you think about it that way, they would come back faster. The bigger projects are going to -- they're come back as they're being more related to the pace of rework.

But could you help us understand, if it does indeed trade down to the 1 90 level that the black market is trading to, what's the financial impact on you?

So with respect to the kwanza, we have a couple of opportunities to protect against that sort of going forward. But you're right, and hence, that's why I made a comment, that there is some risk given the dependence on oil price and oil revenues to that economy. We are protected largely until the time at which we actually bill. So we have sort of 2 elements of risk; one is the receivable risk. And we have been and continue to be talking with our customers. Much of our contractual language gives us relief and protection. Some of our customers we have actually been able to reach good conclusion with, others, we are still in the process. So customer discussions to protect that. In other words, once we invoice, we have to invoice in kwanza as you know from the wall change in 2013, and so that's where the risk exists in further devaluation as we're waiting from payments. Once we get payment, of course, then we have the cash risk. So our opportunities there, in addition to working with our customers to protect us so that neither one of us are unfairly penalized, if you will, is looking at opportunities to invest in country that is a challenge, but we're looking very hard at being able to do that. So we would have some interest income to offset any potential. And then most importantly is to minimize the amount of assets sitting in country. At that point in time, we happen to be sitting with a fairly large receivable position, which is why it happened. So we are also looking at good measures for us to be able to minimize the amount of kwanza that we have sitting there. There is a forward market for kwanza, but it's about a 3-month market, and it's, on average, about 40% cost to us. So heretofore, we have made the conscious decision not to do that. And we think, obviously so far, that has been the right decision. So customer discussions, movement of cash, reinvestment of cash, and obviously, doing everything we can to minimize the amount of cash that's sitting out there. On the receivables question, no, nothing in particular. We are moving a lot of projects into final execution phase. So we have no concerns over any receivable risk whatsoever. This is just normal business as we would have expected. No risk here at all."

Our SIS offering provides a unique combination of surface products and services, providing our customers the benefit of accelerated time to sales and optimized flow rates. We're progressing well with the necessary operational and structural changes to enable the offering. And in the quarter, as we indicated, we took structural charges related to not only the severe drop in activity, as John pointed out, but also because we have the opportunity now to optimize our operating footprint. So we've had several base closures and also additional headcount reductions associated with a leaner, flatter organization. And then finally, we're shifting our supply chain to more optimal cost base, which will provide even additional benefits. So we're confident that these tactical actions, along with the enhanced commercial model or this integrated approach, will yield elevated and sustainable results.

So what we'll be doing in the balance of this year will be largely be subsea as we're preparing for lower volumes. But I am talking that number in 2015."

With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter, Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.7 billion and operating profit was $216 million. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.2 billion, with margins up 14.8%.  Our focus on execution and the strength of our backlog has continued to drive our strong margins. For the full year we still expect subsea margins of around 15%. 
Our activity levels remain near our record 2014 levels, but our full year revenue will be down as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. Maryann will provide further detail on this currency impact.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound totaled $1 billion, bringing our total for the first half of the year to $1.6 billion. We recently received a $297 million BP Shah Deniz Stage 2 project award for manifolds and controls in Azerbaijan. This is the second major award we received from BP for this development. 
Our second quarter subsea orders also included awards for the long lead time materials for 2 large projects that we've been tracking. We expect full funding for these awards in the coming quarters. Second quarter value for each of these awards is relatively small, but the total value for each of these projects will be significant. 
Smaller project award activity increased sequentially, and subsea service activity remained strong during the quarter.
With year-to-date subsea orders of $1.6 billion, we now have increased confidence in exceeding $3 billion of subsea awards. This is supported by the continued strength in our service activity, increasing small order inbound and some large projects we expect to book before year-end.
Our customers remain committed to developing their deepwater portfolios and continue to evaluate their offshore projects for upcoming development. Some of these are in advanced stages and are set to move forward with minimal changes to their original plans. The design and scope of many projects, however, are being significantly reworked to reduce cost and improve project economics. Operators are showing a willingness to accept alternative approaches to the traditional tendering process and are much more open to our vendor-based solutions. 
As offshore projects make up a large part of the future production of many operators, the achievement of improved project economics is imperative. Our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, which became operational in June, provides a meaningful and immediate step change in project economics. The initial response received from operators, both partners and non-partners alike, has exceeded our expectations. This includes IOCs, NOCs and independent operators. The potential fields are in basins throughout the world, and the scope of the projects varies from tiebacks to greenfield developments. The rate at which our clients have identified projects in their portfolios as strong candidates for FEED and concept design using Forsys Subsea capabilities demonstrates the importance of this new approach. The pace and breadth of their commitment gives us confidence of at least 1 award in 2015 and that the first related EPCI award will come next year. 
In our Surface Technologies segment, revenue decreased 19% sequentially as we experienced significant declines in North America activity in the second quarter, consistent with the 35% sequential U.S. rig count decline and the impact of Canadian breakup. More than 1,000 rigs have come out of the market in the last 3 quarters. In response, customer spending reductions have been significant, and price reductions have had a greater impact on us than in prior down cycles.
Our daily fluid control orders fell dramatically in the quarter. We do not expect material changes to this level in the third quarter, and it's unlikely we'll see much recovery before 2016.
As we implement our integrated strategy for our North America business, we continue to consolidate many of our bases and rationalize our workforce to improve our overall operating effectiveness. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continues to perform very well. We continue to forecast strong activity through the remainder of the year but remain vigilant, and we'll react swiftly should we see prolonged market weakness.
Looking forward, the North America land market will remain challenged going into 2016. We're taking actions to consolidate many of our operations within this segment. These will make us a stronger, more integrated business with greater capabilities and a lower cost structure. 
We remain confident in our ability to deliver full year subsea margins of around 15%. We will continue to rightsize our subsea organization in line with our improved efficiencies and anticipated activity levels while protecting our market leadership. 
Deepwater assets continue to be a significant part of many operators' portfolios. As project reevaluations move forward, new approaches are beginning to emerge that improve overall project economics. These are placing a greater reliance on vendor-based solutions and integrated field design and development. We expect this will help the positive order momentum that began in the second quarter continue through the second half of 2015 and into next year. 
Maryann will now take us through some of the financial details for the quarter."

Before I review our operations, I'd like to note that our quarterly earnings results were negatively impacted by total company restructuring charges in the quarter of $0.03 per diluted share and an IRS tax settlement charge of $0.03 per diluted share. 
Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver strong operating results. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue would have increased by $62 million year-over-year. Subsea Technologies operating profit of $184 million in the -- was $184 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total operating profit would have increased $15 million year-over-year. 
Operating margins were 14.8%. We incurred restructuring cost of $5.4 million in the quarter. Excluding these costs, margins were 15.2%, a sequential improvement of 60 basis points from the first quarter. These results are driven by our solid execution of a strong project backlog and the continued strength of subsea service activity despite weaker activity in the North Sea. Although our activity remains high, we were able to reduce further our subsea headcount during the quarter in areas where our internal standardization efforts have delivered efficiency improvements. In the coming quarters, workforce reductions will be more reflective of the anticipated decrease in future year activity due to delayed subsea project inbound. We anticipate an additional $15 million to $20 million of charges in the second half of the year. Further headcount reductions will be made to support future activity levels. 
Given the international composition of subsea, we have experienced continued headwinds of the strong U.S. dollar. In the first half of 2015, the U.S. dollar is significantly stronger than currencies we have the greatest exposure to: NOK, euro and the real. Subsea revenue for the first 6 months of 2015 includes the $251 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue increased by $117 million year-over-year. Operating profit included a $35 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit increased $52 million.
Moving to Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies operating profit for the second quarter was $28 million with a margin of 7.5%. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $2.8 million. Excluding these costs, margins were 8.3%. These results are reflective of the severe slowdown we are seeing in all of our North American land businesses. The sequential drop also includes the impact of Canadian breakup. We have now largely completed the planned headcount reductions associated with the lower activity levels. As John stated, we do not expect to see much recovery before next year. Therefore, our overall U.S. activity is likely to be lower in the second half of the year when compared with the first half. We expect some of this decline to be offset by improvement in our completion services business, which will benefit from increased activity in Canada as we come out of breakup. 
As we have been discussing, we are in the process of reducing our operating cost structure in North America while integrated -- related services on the pad. We expect these actions to continue throughout the remainder of the year and will result in further headcount reductions. These actions will reduce cost and improve our competitive position as market recovers. 
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America continued to perform well, primarily related to activity in the Middle East, offset by some volume decline in Europe. 
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $467 million. This is predominantly surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Energy Infrastructure operating income for the second quarter was $5 million, with a margin of 5.2%. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring cost of $1.3 million. Excluding this cost, margins were 6.5%. We experienced sequential improvement in our loading systems business, but it was partially offset by weakness in our measurement solutions business due to slower activity. We expect segment margins to approach double digits in the back half of the year due to loading systems' continued improvement and somewhat higher activity levels from measurement.
Let's turn to the corporate items. 
Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million. We expect spending of approximately $15 million per quarter throughout 2015. 
Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $30 million. The majority of the higher-than-forecast expense relates to foreign currency losses, primarily associated with the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Given the potential for future devaluation of the kwanza, it is possible we will incur further losses in the second half of the year. 
For the remainder of 2015, we expect other revenue and expense to be approximately $14 million per quarter of expense, with a potential for further foreign currency fluctuations increasing that amount. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 34.1%. This includes a U.S. tax adjustment of $8 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to an IRS audit settlement for years 2007 through 2011. Excluding this, our tax rate would have been 29%. We continue to expect our 2015 full year tax rate to be between 25% and 27%, which includes the U.S. tax audit settlement. 
Capital spending this quarter was $75 million. We expect capital spending in 2015 of approximately $250 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $699 million. It was comprised of $587 million of cash and $1.3 million of debt. We averaged 233 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the second quarter at an average cost of $41.62 per share. 
Looking forward, Energy Infrastructure revenue will be down at least 20% year-over-year, with full year margins in the mid- to high-single digits, negatively impacted by the results in the first half of the year and slower activity in our measurement systems business. Surface Technologies revenue will be down at least 25% from last year due to reduced North America market activity and continued pricing pressure. Full year operating margins should be approximately 12%, excluding severance cost. Subsea revenue for the full year should be approximately $4.8 billion. We continue to expect subsea margins of around 15% as service activity levels remain high and we continue to execute well on our backlog. 
The current market conditions are presenting a number of challenges to our near-term results. However, the strategies we are implementing across our businesses will result in long-term cost savings while preserving our capability to improve our execution as the market recovers.

As we look back at prior cycles, this cycle looks very different than it has in the past. So first of all, we're coming off of a very solid well-priced backlog in this cycle versus last. You may remember during the last down cycle, we were in the process of actually growing our headcount to prepare for growth. In this cycle, actually, we've begun our reduction of workforce heading into this cycle. So another positive. You've seen growth in our subsea services for the last several quarters. And then lastly, as we have demonstrated, our execution continues to improve. All of those things will work quite well for us. Standardization and all the internal work that we have done, if you will, to rationalize the workforce as well as standardize our own internal portfolio will help that as well. All of those things give us confidence in our ability to maintain those margins this year. Clearly, next year, we'll have some struggle at maintaining a 15% margin, obviously, because of pricing.

So we'll still be rolling off a lot of that well-priced backlog into '16. Later in 2016 and beginning into '17 is when you'll really see the impact of that lower margin. And by then, we're quite hopeful that all the additional cost structuring work that we're doing, all of the work within subsea and the internal standardization, will help us offset that as well.

So those conversations are happening as in just the normal course, again, with partners and non-partners alike. The other obvious thing that's happening, I'd like to ask Doug to give more specific commentary on the actual discussions, is the introduction of Forsys. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the reaction by partners, non-partners, large, small, independents, even NOCs, the reaction to the Forsys concept has really exceeded our expectations. And so it's through that mechanism we're also seeing the operators engage with us on the ways that we can accelerate new technology adoption, drive standards, which has been a challenge for the industry, and then there's new business models through Forsys. So I'll ask Doug to talk -- we've had a couple of really very specific conversations with a whole variety of operators, particularly around the Forsys concept, and I think that might illustrate the operators' reaction to change.

Yes, Bill, very interesting meetings that we've had as a result of the Forsys Subsea announcement and introduction to the market. We closed in early June, and we're now out actively engaging with our clients. And as John said, it's a wide breadth of clients, both partners, non-partners IOCs, NOCs and independent operators. And as a result of that, we've entered into discussions deep within their organizations where they've actually assigned teams to work along our teams to look at ways to work differently. This means not only the subsea field architecture and the installation of that architecture, but also the way that we look at the life of the field and how we look at production over the life of the field, and therefore, how we design the upfront equipment and how we introduce sensors and monitoring as a result of that. But what's really quite intriguing is we'll often go in prepared to talk about a particular project or a particular opportunity. And before the meeting is over, we've had, on more than one occasion, the customer introduce to us a portfolio of projects. And these are those projects that have been, if you will, on the cusp or just slightly outside of the -- the project economics have been just outside of the threshold to move those projects forward, and they're now introducing that portfolio and saying, ""Look, if this can work, we have multiple projects that we'd like to conduct under this manner."" Now this does mean a change of commercial behavior, and in any organization there's resistance to changes to commercial behavior, but we're seeing a very quick and early uptake and a willingness to move forward and operate in a different manner."

Let me kind of hopefully not digress, but sort of set the stage. When you think of any industry, particularly our industry, attempting to go through a major step change in how we do business, it seems like it requires certain things. First of",652,"Thanks, Ole. Let me kind of hopefully not digress, but sort of set the stage. When you think of any industry, particularly our industry, attempting to go through a major step change in how we do business, it seems like it requires certain things. First of all, it requires the business imperative, which now we have, not just because of low oil prices but because of declining returns. So there's a sense of urgency, there's a business imperative to make change. And we've talked about that before. It can't be incremental change to improve the returns. It has to be -- they have to be significant, material, and they have to be sustainable. So the industry, it has that imperative because of the declining returns. The second, I think, important thing is that the solution to make -- that drives the step change, it has to be real, it has to be tangible and it has to be compelling. And the Forsys Subsea change in business model is very much that. And then thirdly, if you're going to make a step change, it has to be relatively simple to implement. Something that's compounded or just complex and convoluted is going to be very difficult for an industry to make that kind of step change. And then finally, and this, ultimately, may be the most important thing. If you're asking an industry to go through -- make a significant step change it requires a leap of faith, and the leap of faith requires some level of trust. And so when I think of -- when Terry (sic) [Thierry] and I and the team talk to operators, and again, as Doug described, it is the full range. And I was actually pretty surprised that of all oil companies, national oil companies are even interested in that. But large, small, it's these 4 elements that end up in the conversation that almost always ends up around trust. And you're right, given the relationships that we've built at all levels in the organization through our partnerships and non-partnerships, there's a great deal of trust there, and I think we're capitalizing on that as we have this conversation about how to make a step change. What is especially interesting, and Doug alluded to it, it's not uncommon when we approach an operator that very quickly, we get beyond the interest and intrigue into this new concept, and fairly quickly, in the course of even the initial meeting, we're talking about specific projects. And as Doug said, we go from specific projects to the entire portfolio. What we've also seen happen, I think was -- well, to the degree it's being adopted is unexpected. Very quickly, we go from the C-level conversation and the high-level directors to assigning a joint project team to pursue applying this concept to a likely candidate from their portfolio. So very quickly, we're getting -- and this is especially true of the smaller independents who don't have all those layers. Very quickly, we get to a project team with the operator joined with ours pursuing that with the direction from the C-level. So we've actually been pretty impressed, especially with smaller independents, even some that have been non-partners of ours, of how quickly they've been able to influence and convince the levels below them to seriously look at this concept. Now a larger operator with many, many more levels, maybe a larger subsea organization that has to be convinced, I don't think we're naïve. We know that it's going to take more of an effort. But one of the things that -- is different here, though, again is even at C-level and below, they're going beyond the interest and intrigue and they're naming projects, and I think that will be one of the keys. Doug, do you want to add to that based on your more specific experience on some of these conversations?"

This -- it's there. We're not naive. We recognize it's there. But there's been much less resistance than we had expected to experience. And even with the large operators. We're sitting there talking about fields and, again, portfolios of opportunities that they're anxious to move forward now that there's a solution.

In addition to that, there's -- obviously, we're trying to drive new business, new commercial models through Forsys Subsea. We have several examples, several examples of where we're working with our customers right now as they either reengineer projects that had not moved forward given the current economics and/or new projects including both tiebacks and greenfields. And we're going through these, if you will, these 4 steps to drive and improve the overall Subsea project economics with the overall objective of, obviously, creating more market and moving those projects forward. We continue to see savings in the range that we had previously indicated and that you indicated.

So obviously, we had a strong Q2. You add Q1 and Q2 together, $1.6 billion. We're over halfway to our target of $3 billion. What gives us the confidence? We said in the last quarter that we were pleased with the subsea service activity in the first quarter. It sort of mirrored the run rates that we had in 2014. We thought it would hold up. It did hold up in the second quarter. Second quarter subsea service numbers were equivalent, actually a little bit better than the first quarter numbers. That's 2 quarters in a row, and it's downturn of subsea service inbound holding up, that gives us confidence. The second thing is the small, less than $100 million orders. In the first quarter, they were down substantially from our run rate in 2014. In the second quarter, they bounced back fairly significantly sequentially, and they start to mirror the small order inbound that we got in 2013 and 2014. And we hope that, that was the case. I think in the first quarter call, we said that we thought the low number on small orders was a result of the operators kind of stopping everything while they re-did their budgets, and we were hopeful that, that would come back this year. And sure enough, it did in Q2. So we expect that number to be stronger going forward. Obviously, winning the Shah Deniz project was important to us, and we had counted on that. We were tracking a handful of other projects that we, some of which, we expect to be inbounded in 2015. 
Winning 2 major projects, long lead-time material is really important to us. That means those projects are likely to go ahead and it means that we're going to win them. Now when they actually fall, they could move into '16. But that gives us a lot of confidence that we'll pick up the couple of projects we need for the balance of the year, and therefore, now, we have more confidence that we'll exceed the $3 billion target that we put out there. So that's 2015. Now going into 2016, it's what you alluded to. The long list of projects, over $7 billion of major projects, have been identified for 2015 before the downturn. Those have all now been -- many of them have been, not all, but many of them have been deferred and they're being reworked. We expect that rework, which is happening fairly fast, and hopefully in part, even due to the efforts that we're working with our partners, whether it's Forsys or non-Forsys, to improve those economics, that those start to move forward. And we should start seeing that move forward, balance of 2015 into 2016, and we start to ramp back up at some point to the historical numbers of Subsea developments that we saw in the past. We know that the discoveries are there. We know the fields are there, the portfolios are there. The question is, how fast can the operators adopt some of these new concepts, rework their scope of these development projects and get back to the pace that we saw in 2013 and 2014. But we expect that to start picking up in 2016. I'm not saying the 2016 inbound level will replicate '13 or '14, but we ought to see some sort of ramp-up when there's this backlog of projects, go through the rework process, go to the FID process and turn into awards."

One reason why we saw the Q2 bump up in smaller projects, not surprisingly, they were in the Gulf of Mexico and many of them were our partners. We have a lot of partners in the Gulf of Mexico. We have a strong position. The Gulf of Mexico, the projects are smaller. They don't cut as much into the capital budgets. They usually have better economics because they're tying back to existing infrastructure. They happen faster because national oil companies aren't involved in production-sharing contract bidding process. So yes, I think the smaller projects bounce back first because they're generally Gulf of Mexico-related and they don't have -- they're smaller, so their capital demands are less and the lead times are faster. So yes, I guess when you think about it that way, they would come back faster. The bigger projects are going to -- they're going to come back as they're being more related to the pace of rework.

So with respect to the kwanza, we have a couple of opportunities to protect against that sort of going forward. But you're right, and hence, that's why I made the comment that there is some risk given the dependence on oil price and oil revenues to that economy. We are protected largely until the time at which we actually bill. So we have sort of 2 elements of risk; one is the receivable risk. And we have been and continue to be talking with our customers. Much of our contractual language gives us relief and protection. Some of our customers we have actually been able to reach good conclusion with, others, we are still in the process. So customer discussions to protect that -- in other words, once we invoice, we have to invoice in kwanza as you know from the law change in 2013, and so that's where the risk exists in further devaluation as we're waiting from payments. Once we get payment, of course, then we have the cash risk. So our opportunities there, in addition to working with our customers to protect us so that neither one of us are unfairly penalized, if you will, is looking at opportunities to invest in-country. That is a challenge, but we're looking very hard at being able to do that. So we would have some interest income to offset any potential. And then most importantly is to minimize the amount of assets sitting in-country. At that point in time, we happened to be sitting with a fairly large receivable position, which is why it happened. So we are also looking at good measures for us to be able to minimize the amount of kwanza that we have sitting there. There is a forward market for kwanza, but it's about a 3-month market, and it's, on average, about 40% cost to us. So heretofore, we have made the conscious decision not to do that. And we think, obviously so far, that has been the right decision. So customer discussions, movement of cash, reinvestment of cash, and obviously, doing everything we can to minimize the amount of cash that's sitting out there. On the receivables question, no, nothing in particular. We are moving a lot of projects into final execution phase. So we have no concerns over any receivable risk whatsoever. This is just normal business as we would have expected. No risk here at all."

The pressure on pricing and what we've had to accept across the board, surface, fluid control, completion services, has been much more severe than we saw in the past. And I think you're right, it's the severity and the steepness and the speed at which this downturn occurred drove much more aggressive pricing pressure, and that's what made this cycle different than the past and why our Q2 numbers were disappointing from what we thought they would be. As Maryann pointed out, we're taking action. We didn't anticipate this cycle to be different. Now that it is, we're going through another around of restructuring. And I think more importantly, if I can, Byron, I'd like to talk about a little bit about our North America strategy because that's more than just restructuring.

We're putting in place very structural and sustainable changes to the way that we operate our business in North America. As you know, we have 3 primary businesses in North America, and they have worked somewhat autonomously in the past, servicing their individual portions of the market. We think there's real value in the integration of those services, and that's why we made the acquisition we made a couple of years back to really fulfill the requirements to be able to offer that full integrated solution. So we call that surface integrated solutions, and that's our North America business. And as we discussed last quarter, and John just alluded to, the transformation of that is underway. Our SIS offering provides a unique combination of surface products and services, providing our customers the benefit of accelerated time to sales and optimized flow rates. We're progressing well with the necessary operational and structural changes to enable the offering. And in the quarter, as we indicated, we took structural charges related to not only the severe drop in activity, as John pointed out, but also because we have the opportunity now to optimize our operating footprint. So we've had several base closures and also additional headcount reductions associated with a leaner, flatter organization. And then finally, we're shifting our supply chain to more optimal cost base, which will provide even additional benefits. So we're confident that these tactical actions, along with the enhanced commercial model or this integrated approach, will yield elevated and sustainable results. The full benefit of which -- we won't begin to see the full benefit until 2016. But as Maryann pointed out, some of the more tactical steps that we're taking, we'll see the benefit in the second half of this year."

With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter. Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.61 per diluted share for the quarter excluding the impairment charges of $60.2 million and total company restructuring charges of $18 million. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, and operating profit was $224 million, again, excluding the impairment of business restructuring charges. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.1 billion with margins of 16.9%, excluding the Subsea business restructuring charges. Our focus on execution and the strength of our backlog continues to drive our strong margins. For the full year, we still expect Subsea margins excluding the restructuring charges of around 15%.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound orders totaled more than $1 billion for the second quarter in a row, bringing our year-to-date total to $2.6 billion. Improved deepwater project economics are imperative to ensure that this critical resource is available to meet the world's future hydrocarbon demand. Our focus on improved execution, standardization, innovative technology and the vendor-based integrated business models for both significantly and sustainably reduce cost and improve returns for our deepwater developments. We recently announced awards for Statoil's Johann project in Norway and Shell's project in the Gulf of Mexico. In the case of both of these awards, we collaborated closely with our customers to identify the most cost-effective solutions to improve project economics.
Given the awards achieved this quarter, the anticipated smaller orders next quarter and sustaining of strong level of subsea services activity, we have further confidence to achieve our targeted full year inbound guidance of at least $3 billion of inbound orders in 2015.
Based on the number of named future subsea projects and the progress made on improving project economics, 2016 subsea market activity has the potential to be on par with 2015. However, given the continued uncertainty of oil prices and capital spending by the operators, we lack the visibility to project subsea orders for next year. Now despite this uncertainty, operators remain committed to deepwater. They're prioritizing capital spending towards production, and they've been successful in improving project economics, all of which support the future growth in subsea activity. Operators continue to show a willingness to accept vendor-based approaches versus the traditional client-specific requirements. An example of this is the additional Chevron to our high-pressure high-temperature joint industry program that was announced in July of last year. Our company, along with 5 operators, are collaborating to help solve the technical and economic deepwater challenges through standardization of materials, processes and interfaces.
We continue supporting our customers' producing assets by leveraging our installed footprint and technology leadership to improve project economics through cost savings and increased recovery. We reached an agreement to produce a multiphase pump solutions for Shell's BC 10 field in Brazil to replace the current separation and boosting modules. At this time, the agreement covers just the first boosting unit.
As we previously mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, the initial response from operators to Forsys Subsea, our joint venture with Technip, exceeded our expectations. Operators' acceptance of our vendor-based integrated approach at the concept stage has been both real and compelling as evident by the receipt of 2 integrated front-end engineering studies in this quarter. The commitment from these operators gives us further confidence that our alliance with Technip will be awarded an integrated EPC contract in 2016.
Turning to the performance of our Surface Technologies segment. Revenue remained flat sequentially as our surface wellhead business outside of North America performed well, offset by further weakness in our North American onshore business.
Given the decline in the North America onshore activity, our fluid control orders remain well below historic levels. The North American rig count is expected to further deteriorate, and in response, customer spending remains depressed, and pricing will remain under pressure. In light of this market outlook, we've taken aggressive action and continue to streamline our North American initiatives to improve our cost structure.
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America performed well in the quarter. We expect activity to remain similar to current levels as we ended the year. However, we expect future months will begin to show the impact of pricing pressure as a result of a deteriorating global market. We're restructuring our operations in response to this weaker market.
In summary, we continue to see a challenge North America Latin market and do not expect any recovery as we go on to 2016. We're taking aggressive action as he manage through this downturn to improve our operating effectiveness, and we continue to accelerate our strategic initiatives to improve our position in the North American onshore market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver full year subsea margins of around 15% excluding restructuring charges. We will continue to strategically restructure our subsea segment in line with anticipated activity levels and also in the way that allows us to sustainably operate with a leaner organization in anticipation of a market recovery.
During the quarter, we achieved important milestones in our effort to improve deepwater project economics through execution, standardization, technology and new business models. These milestones are also evidence of the industry's willingness to adopt a real and compelling changes in how deepwater fields are developed. 
Maryann will now take you through the financial details of the quarter."
972117,307313880,878616,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I would like to note, as announced on Monday, that our third quarter earnings results were negatively impacted by impairment charges, primarily in our Surface Technologies segment of $0.20 per diluted share. W",1194,"Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I would like to note, as announced on Monday, that our third quarter earnings results were negatively impacted by impairment charges, primarily in our Surface Technologies segment of $0.20 per diluted share. We also incurred business restructuring charges mainly in the Subsea Technologies segment of $0.06 per diluted share, as previously communicated. When excluding the impact of these 2 items, diluted earnings per share were $0.61 for the quarter. Our Subsea Technologies segment continued to deliver strong operating results as we executed well in our strong project backlog and cost-reduction initiatives are being realized. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $155 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit of $171 million in the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were negatively impacted by $27 million of foreign currency translations due to the strength of the dollar. 
Operating margins were 15.6%. We incurred business restructuring cost of $14.6 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and restructuring charges, operating profit was up approximately 4% year-over-year. As you may remember, we communicated on our last quarterly call that we expected to see cost in coming quarters for restructuring in subsea -- our subsea business. Excluding these costs, margins were 16.9% of sequential improvement of 170 basis points when excluding the comparable charge in the second quarter. Our subsea segment has yet to see a decline in activity and, in fact, absent the headwinds from the strength of the U.S. dollar, year-to-date subsea revenue is actually up slightly from 2014. The actions we have taken throughout this year including the significant actions in the third quarter will help us develop a stronger and leaner organization as we prepare for the decline in activity in 2016. We have further restructuring within the organization -- we will have further restructuring within the organization in the fourth quarter. As we enter 2016, our subsea organization headcount will be more reflective of the anticipated decrease in activity due to delayed subsea project inbound. As we see 2016 activity, we will make further assessments on our operating structure. We anticipate an additional $6 million to $8 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. We continue to experience headwind due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Looking at the first 3 quarters of 2015, the U.S. dollar is significantly stronger against currencies we have the greatest exposure to but not the euro and the real. Subsea revenue for the first 9 months of 2015 include more than $400 million of unfavorable impact, and operating profit includes more than $60 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Absent the foreign currency translation, total revenue year-to-date is slightly favorable year-over-year, and operating profit year-to-date increased by approximately $45 million year-over-year.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies reported operating profits for the third quarter of $37 million excluding impairment charges of $58 million, primarily related to our Canadian business and restructuring charges of $2 million. Excluding these costs, operating margins were 10.3%. These results represent continued strength in our non-North America surface wellhead business. As this a later cycle business competitive North America, we continue working off a healthy backlog and so on increase in orders in the quarter. However, current pricing is beginning to reflect a more challenging environment. As John stated, we do not expect to see a recovery before next year on our North American businesses. As discussed in the last earnings call, we are continuing to reduce our operating cost structure for North America while integrated -- integrating related products and services to deliver greater value to our customer. We expect these actions to continue through the fourth quarter and will result in further headcount reductions with an expected cost of approximately $4 million to $6 million. These actions will continue to reduce cost and improve our competitive position as the market recovers.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $495 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Moving to our final segment. Energy Infrastructure revenue for the third quarter was $97 million. Operating loss for the segment was $2 million as our profitable loading systems results were more than offset by continued slower activity in our measurement solutions business. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring cost of $1.7 million. Given that lower activity levels are likely to continue, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter due to further headcount reductions.
Let me turn to our corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 [ph] million. We expect spending of approximately $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, including anticipated restructuring charges of approximately $3 million associated with headcount reductions. 
Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $22 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect other revenue and expense to be approximately $15 million with a potential for further foreign currency fluctuation increasing this amount. Our third quarter tax rate was 19.2%, primarily due to a change in geographical earnings mix. We expect our 2015 full year tax rate to be between 24% and 26%, which includes the U.S. tax audit settlement discussed last quarter. Capital spending this quarter was $50 million. We expect capital spending in 2015 of approximately $250 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $583 million. It is comprised of $712 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We average 231 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock during the third quarter at an average cost of $33.95 per share. In summary, we expect total company restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of $15 million to $20 million. Looking forward, Energy Infrastructure revenue is now expected to be down more than 25% year-over-year with full year margin in the mid-single digits negatively impacted by the results due to slower activity in our measurement solutions business. We no longer expect to see a recovery in this business in the next few quarters, given that activity corresponds to the North American market. As indicated, we continue to take action to improve performance. Surface Technologies revenue is expected to be down nearly 30% from last year due to reduced North American market activity. Full year operating margin will be approximately 10% excluding business restructuring and impairment charges as we will see continued pricing pressure. Subsea revenue for the full year should be approximately $4.6 billion as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to make a greater negative impact. As to the headwinds, we are having our strongest year in subsea revenues. We continue to expect subsea margins excluding restructuring charges of around 15% as we execute well in our backlog and cost-reduction initiatives improve performance. The current market conditions are presenting a number of challenges to our near-term results. However, the actions related to the strategies we are implementing across our businesses will result in long-term cost savings while preserving our capabilities to improve our execution as the market recovers.

These are projects that may or may not have actually been able to go forward had it not been for this different approach.

So we look at these 2 awards that we're discussing today, it actually fits into that category. So the first was for an independent operator who was a nonpartner, and this is a greenfield approach. This is actually the concept stage. So in this particular case, the value proposition was by aligning and having early engagement, making a commitment to partners and close collaboration that they would be able to take anywhere from 18 to 24 months off of first oil delivery. So that was the real value proposition, whilst at the same time recognizing and experiencing the savings that will come from a vendor-based integrated front-end engineering projects. So that was an example. The other example was for an IOC, a partner and in this case, a brownfield application. If you will, this is a field that's going to tie back to an existing host. In this particular example, we got involved at the FEED stage or we are involved in the FEED stage, I should say. I guess this project, I would say, had some economical hurdles that needed to be overcome. The customer recognized 2 things that by using this approach: one, they had the very real possibility of overcoming those economical hurdles, which we certainly expect to be the result; and in addition they saw this as a way to change the behavior within their own company by changing the approach to: one, early engagement; two, committing to doing an integrated project and an integrated delivery of that project or, if you will, an integrated EPC project. And this is really a change of behavior, and this was a catalyst for us receiving that award. So 2 very different projects with different characteristics, but again, it demonstrates the very broad interest that we are receiving in our integrated approach along with our partner, Technip."

We said earlier that there was a -- the interest exceeded our expectations from the full range of operators including even NOCs.

Now on top of that, absolutely, we're going to see benefits, and the benefits are going to come from the integrated planning and execution better delivery improved execution. As John has mentioned many times, the execution and subsea projects has been not great over a long period of time for our industry, and this is a way for us to address that as well. the introduction of new technology will come over time.

We think some of the maybe discretionary services because of CapEx cutbacks will face some headwinds, so we might come under our past run rate but figure $1 billion plus, $1.5 billion, something under $1.5 billion can be our subsea service number potentially. On the small 1C, 2Cs, the third quarter number that you referenced is too high. We had fairly -- there in the second -- we're watching the 1Cs, 2Cs very closely because we think the Gulf of Mexico market will probably hold up better in this downturn than any of the other markets, and we have a very strong position. In Q1, the small orders coming out of the Gulf of Mexico were very, very light. In the second quarter, they were very strong. In the third quarter, they were not strong. They weren't as light as the first quarter, but they were close to it. So we think that the 1C, 2Cs are demonstrating a kind of lumpy characteristic to become a little hard to predict. But in the 2016, we'd expect -- I mean it's not going to go 0. It's not going to look like Q1 of 2015 but probably continue to look like an average of 2015, so that would make up a number for 2016. And then we would have to win, as we did in 2015, several major awards. And this is where I showed my caution because not knowing capital budgets not knowing whether or not these major projects will be included in the 2016 capital budget, it's hard to predict. But assuming that they would make the cut and included in those capital budgets, we would need a couple of 2 or 3, I don't want to say on which ones and how large, but we would need several major subsea awards. It's hard to imagine getting to an equivalent 2015 subsea inbound without a major Africa project. So those would have to come in, and that's how we get to the components of a 2016 subsea inbound that's on par with 2015. The big question are whether or not these big projects going to be include the capital budgets, and we won't know that until later."

I think in the near term, the next year or so, we've got to put subsea processing projects in the pace of which they're awarded and pursued in the context of a pullback on capital spending on operators redirecting their capital spending towards production, certain projects that are in the queue that for very strategic reasons they want to proceed with, all in the context of the smaller capital budget. It doesn't mean that subsea processing technology in these projects aren't very, very compelling financially to the operators. They are. But I think we should assume that they're going to go little bit on the back burner for the next year because of the capital constraints. There are several projects that are out there. Now that our pump is -- we broke in ice our first award we're going to be. We know that we're qualified of the number of operators we're going to be pursuing other projects but they think there might be a temporary slowing in the pace of subsea projects in the next year or so just because of the characterization of the projects in the capital budgets. But as you can appreciate, we are very encouraged that we broke through getting our pump qualified last year. Now we've broken through getting our first award. We're now competing in the processing market. And that market will come. Absolutely, it will come. The economics are very compelling. I just think that the pressure on capital budgets will have an impact on the near-term pace of a project that goes forward on processing."

They operate in the production-sharing contract agreements, which require a common tender document. The approach is fixed. It's standard. Multiple contractors bid the projects that's built into the production-sharing contract process. And we really didn't expect for any serious interest from the NOCs, and so we were surprised when the NOCs -- and not just one but multiple NOCs don't rule us out. We are interested. They want improve their economics as well. They saw the compelling nature of this different business model. Now when challenged -- when challenged they, said yes, you're right, we have production sharing contract processes that require tendering but there some options that we have to consider like a design competition upfront, so that we meet our tendering requirements make it still apply this new business model. I think you're right. For the NOCs to go from interest to actual implementation as opposed to the 2 clients that Doug discussed and the awards, it's going to come later because they have natural hurdles you have to overcome, and I'm sure they're going to want to see the success of this different business model before they proceed.

We are able to avoid some expansion cost and spread out the deliveries over a period that takes us through mid-2019, and we think that backlog will stay intact.

Welcome to our Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter. Maryann will provide",920,"Good morning. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter. Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.61 per diluted share for the quarter excluding the impairment charges of $60.2 million and total company restructuring charges of $18 million. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, and operating profit was $224 million, again, excluding the impairment and business restructuring charges. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.1 billion with margins of 16.9%, excluding the Subsea business restructuring charges. Our focus on execution and the strength of our backlog continues to drive our strong margins. For the full year, we still expect Subsea margins excluding the restructuring charges of around 15%.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound orders totaled more than $1 billion for the second quarter in a row, bringing our year-to-date total to $2.6 billion. Improved deepwater project economics are imperative to ensure that this critical resource is available to meet the world's future hydrocarbon demand. Our focus on improved execution, standardization, innovative technology and the vendor-based integrated business models will both significantly and sustainably reduce cost and improve returns for deepwater developments. We recently announced awards for Statoil's Johan Sverdrup project in Norway and Shell's Appomattox project in the Gulf of Mexico. In the case of both of these awards, we collaborated closely with our customers to identify the most cost-effective solutions to improve project economics.
Given the awards achieved this quarter, the anticipated smaller orders next quarter and sustaining a strong level of subsea services activity, we have further confidence to achieve our targeted full year inbound guidance of at least $3 billion of inbound orders in 2015.
Based on the number of named future Subsea projects and the progress made on improving project economics, 2016 Subsea market activity has the potential to be on par with 2015. However, given the continued uncertainty of oil prices and capital spending by the operators, we lack the visibility to project Subsea orders for next year. Now despite this uncertainty, operators remain committed to deepwater. They're prioritizing capital spending towards production, and they've been successful in improving project economics, all of which support the future growth in subsea activity. 
Operators continue to show a willingness to accept vendor-based approaches versus the traditional client-specific requirements. An example of this is the addition of Chevron to our high-pressure, high-temperature joint industry program that was announced in July of last year. Our company, along with 5 operators, are collaborating to help solve the technical and economic deepwater challenges through standardization of materials, processes and interfaces.
We continue supporting our customers' producing assets by leveraging our installed footprint and technology leadership to improve project economics through cost savings and increased recovery. We've reached an agreement to produce a multiphase pump solution for Shell's BC-10 field in Brazil to replace the current separation and boosting modules. At this time, the agreement covers just the first boosting unit.
As we previously mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, the initial response from operators to Forsys Subsea, our joint venture with Technip, exceeded our expectations. Operators' acceptance of our vendor-based integrated approach at the concept stage as being both real and compelling is evident by the receipt of 2 integrated front-end engineering studies in this quarter. The commitment from these operators gives us further confidence that our alliance with Technip will be awarded an integrated EPC contract in 2016.
Turning to the performance of our Surface Technologies segment. Revenue remained flat sequentially as our surface wellhead business outside of North America performed well, offset by further weakness in our North American onshore business. Given the decline in the North America onshore activity, our fluid control orders remain well below historic levels. The North American rig count is expected to further deteriorate, and in response, customer spending remains depressed and pricing will remain under pressure. In light of this market outlook, we've taken aggressive action and continued to streamline our North American initiatives to improve our cost structure.
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America performed well in the quarter. We expect activity to remain similar to current levels as we end the year. However, we expect future months will begin to show the impact of pricing pressure as a result of a deteriorating global market. We're restructuring our operations in response to this weaker market.
In summary, we continue to see a challenged North America land market and do not expect any recovery as we go into 2016. We're taking aggressive action as we manage through this downturn to improve our operating effectiveness, and we continue to accelerate our strategic initiatives to improve our position in North American onshore market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver full year Subsea margins of around 15% excluding restructuring charges. We'll continue to strategically restructure our Subsea segment in line with anticipated activity levels and also in a way that allows us to sustainably operate with a leaner organization in anticipation of a market recovery.
During the quarter, we achieved important milestones in our effort to improve deepwater project economics through execution, standardization, technology and new business models. These milestones are also evidence of the industry's willingness to adopt real and compelling changes in how deepwater fields are developed. 
Maryann will now take you through the financial details of the quarter."

Before I review our operations, I would like to note, as announced on Monday, that our third quarter earnings results were negatively impacted by impairment charges, primarily in our Surface Technologies segment, of $0.20 per diluted share.",1194,"Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I would like to note, as announced on Monday, that our third quarter earnings results were negatively impacted by impairment charges, primarily in our Surface Technologies segment, of $0.20 per diluted share. We also incurred business restructuring charges, mainly in the Subsea Technologies segment, of $0.06 per diluted share, as previously communicated. When excluding the impact of these 2 items, diluted earnings per share were $0.61 for the quarter. Our Subsea Technologies segment continued to deliver strong operating results as we executed well on our strong project backlog and cost-reduction initiatives are being realized. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $155 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit of $171 million in the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were negatively impacted by $27 million of foreign currency translation due to the strength of the dollar. 
Operating margins were 15.6%. We incurred business restructuring costs of $14.6 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and restructuring charges, operating profit was up approximately 4% year-over-year. As you may remember, we communicated on our last quarterly call that we expected to see costs in coming quarters for restructuring in Subsea -- our Subsea business. Excluding these costs, margins were 16.9%, a sequential improvement of 170 basis points when excluding the comparable charge in the second quarter. Our Subsea segment has yet to see a decline in activity, and in fact, absent the headwinds from the strength of the U.S. dollar, year-to-date Subsea revenue is actually up slightly from 2014. The actions we have taken throughout this year, including the significant actions in the third quarter, will help us develop a stronger and leaner organization as we prepare for the decline in activity in 2016. We have further restructuring within the organization -- we will have, excuse me, further restructuring within the organization in the fourth quarter. As we enter 2016, our Subsea organization headcount will be more reflective of the anticipated decrease in activity due to delayed Subsea project inbound. As we see 2016 activity, we will make further assessments on our operating structure. We anticipate an additional $6 million to $8 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. We continue to experience headwinds due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Looking at the first 3 quarters of 2015, the U.S. dollar is significantly stronger against currencies we have the greatest exposure to, but not the euro and the real. Subsea revenue for the first 9 months of 2015 includes more than $400 million of unfavorable impact, and operating profit includes more than $60 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Absent the foreign currency translation, total revenue year-to-date is slightly favorable year-over-year and operating profit year-to-date increased by approximately $45 million year-over-year.
Moving to our Surface Technology results. Surface Technology reported operating profits for the third quarter of $37 million excluding impairment charges of $58 million primarily related to our Canadian business and restructuring charges of $2 million. Excluding these costs, operating margins were 10.3%. These results represent continued strength in our non-North America surface wellhead business. As this is a later-cycle business compared to North America, we continue working off a healthy backlog and so an increase in orders in the quarter. However, current pricing is beginning to reflect a more challenging environment. As John stated, we do not expect to see a recovery before next year in our North American businesses. As discussed in the last earnings call, we are continuing to reduce our operating cost structure for North America while integrating related products and services to deliver greater value to our customer. We expect these actions to continue through the fourth quarter and will result in further headcount reductions, with an expected cost of approximately $4 million to $6 million. These actions will continue to reduce cost and improve our competitive position as the market recovers. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $495 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Moving to our final segment. Energy Infrastructure revenue for the third quarter was $97 million. Operating loss for the segment was $2 million as our profitable Loading Systems results were more than offset by continued slower activity in our measurement solutions business. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $1.7 million. Given that lower activity levels are likely to continue, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter due to further headcount reductions.
Let me turn to our corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 million. We expect spending of approximately $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, including anticipated restructuring charges of approximately $3 million associated with headcount reductions. 
Other revenue and expense, net, reflects expense of $22 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect other revenue and expense to be approximately $15 million, with the potential for further foreign currency fluctuation increasing this amount. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 19.2% primarily due to a change in geographical earnings mix. We expect our 2015 full year tax rate to be between 24% and 26%, which includes the U.S. tax audit settlement discussed last quarter. 
Capital spending this quarter was $50 million. We expect capital spending in 2015 of approximately $250 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $583 million. It is comprised of $712 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We averaged 231 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock during the third quarter at an average cost of $33.95 per share. In summary, we expect total company restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of $15 million to $20 million. 
Looking forward, Energy Infrastructure revenue is now expected to be down more than 25% year-over-year, with full year margins in the mid-single digits negatively impacted by the poor results due to slower activity in our measurement solutions business. We no longer expect to see a recovery in this business in the next few quarters given that activity corresponds to the North American market. As indicated, we continue to take actions to improve performance. 
Surface Technologies revenue is expected to be down nearly 30% from last year due to reduced North American market activity. Full year operating margins will be approximately 10% excluding business restructuring and impairment charges as we will see continued pricing pressure. 
Subsea revenue for the full year should be approximately $4.6 billion as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to make a greater negative impact. Absent the headwinds, we are having our strongest year in Subsea revenues. We continue to expect Subsea margins excluding restructuring charges of around 15% as we execute well in our backlog and cost-reduction initiatives improve performance. The current market conditions are presenting a number of challenges to our near-term results. However, the actions related to the strategies we are implementing across our businesses will result in long-term cost savings while preserving our capabilities to improve our execution as the market recovers.

One of the things that we found of particular interest was that those projects that had not been started in terms of concept design and had maybe been sort of shelved in terms of the project economics were the ones that the operators seemed to have the most interest in applying the Forsys methodology. And the 2 FEED studies that we received the awards for, I think, both fit into that category. These are projects that may or may not have actually been able to go forward had it not been for this different approach. I'd like Doug to comment more, though, specifically on, overall, the interest that we've had on the FEED studies and these 2 awards that we've got, a little bit more color on what was behind them.

David, you may recall, last quarter, we talked about a wide range of interest, interest from partners as well as non-partners, interest from independents as well as IOCs and NOCs and also that the approach we were finding had great applicability on both greenfields as well as brownfields. So if we look at these 2 awards that we're discussing today, it actually fits into that category. So the first was for an independent operator who was a non-partner, and this is a greenfield approach. This is actually at the concept stage. So in this particular case, the value proposition was, by aligning and having early engagement, making a commitment to partners and close collaboration that they would be able to take anywhere from 18 to 24 months off of first oil delivery. So that was the real value proposition, whilst at the same time, recognizing and experiencing the savings that will come from a vendor-based, integrated, front-end engineering project. So that was one example. The other example was for an IOC, a partner, and in this case, a brownfield application. If you will, this is a field that's going to tie back to an existing host. In this particular example, we got involved at the FEED stage -- or we are involved at the FEED stage, I should say. And yes, this project, I would say, had some economical hurdles that needed to be overcome. The customer recognized 2 things that, by using this approach, one, they had the very real possibility of overcoming those economical hurdles, which we certainly expect to be the result. And in addition, they saw this as a way to change the behavior within their own company by changing the approach to, one, early engagement; two, committing to doing an integrated project and an integrated delivery of that project or, if you will, an integrated EPC project. And this is really a change in behavior, and this was a catalyst for us receiving that award. So 2 very different projects with different characteristics, but again, it demonstrates the very broad interest that we are receiving in our integrated approach along with our partner, Technip."

We said earlier that there was a -- the interest exceeded our expectations from the full range of operators, including even NOCs, all geographies, as Doug said, greenfield and brownfield. It suggests that the breadth of the interest and application of this different approach could apply to virtually all deepwater projects.

It's a combination of both the ability to do the integrated planning and execution and the cost savings associated with that as well as the introduction of different technologies. But most importantly, it's removing components, actual hardware, from the subsea field design by working together early with the SURF provider, with Technip, to be able to look at ways that we can streamline the interfaces between the umbilical risers and flow lines in our traditional subsea production system, thus physically removing and permanently lowering the cost of subsea field developments.

Now on top of that, absolutely, we're going to see benefits, and the benefits are going to come from the integrated planning and execution, better delivery, improved execution.

The introduction of new technology will come over time. Just to remind everyone, the actual relationship is just slightly over 120 days old, and we continue -- we do have a robust plan for the development of new technology. But what we're seeing right now is actual savings from the physical removal of interfaces -- or streamlining of interfaces and then the streamlining of the actual installation of the subsea field."

And John, so you prophesied that at this stage, notwithstanding that the visibility is somewhat limited, you feel like 2016 would be equivalent to '15. And I'm just curious as to the components of that. It seemed like if I back into it, that your onesie and twosie baseline for the third quarter was running at about $650 million. So if you assume that for 2016, that's $2.6 billion. And then you're assuming something close to like $1 billion in major projects in '16, assuming the fourth quarter of this year comes in at close to what you did in the third. And so when you get to that math, I'm just curious about the major project composition. We've been talking about Greater Western Flank here for a while, talking about Cobalt and Cameia. We've been talking about Mad Dog Phase 2. The one that's the biggest one which seems to be slipping, at least based upon the fact that you're not upsized relative to '15, is Bonga South West. So can you comment about that formulation and some of those projects, please?"

We think in 2016, the installation portion of that will hold up. We think some of the maybe discretionary services, because of CapEx cutbacks, will face some headwinds, so we might come under our past run rate, but figure $1 billion-plus, $1.5 billion, something under $1.5 billion could be our subsea service number potentially. On the small onesie-twosies, the third quarter number that you referenced is too high. We had fairly -- we're watching the onesie-twosies very closely because we think that the Gulf of Mexico market will probably hold up better in this downturn than any of the other markets, and we have a very strong position. In Q1, the small orders particularly coming out of the Gulf of Mexico were very, very light. In the second quarter, they were very strong. In the third quarter, they were not strong. They weren't as light as the first quarter, but they were close to it. So we think that the onesie-twosies are demonstrating a kind of lumpy characteristic that's kind of becoming a little hard to project. But in 2016, we'd expect -- I mean, it's not going to go 0. It's not going to look like Q1 of 2015 but probably continue to look like an average of 2015, so that would make up a number for 2016. And then we would have to win, as we did in 2015, several major awards. And this is where I showed my caution because not knowing capital budgets, not knowing whether or not these major projects will be included in the 2016 capital budget, it's hard to predict. But assuming that they would make the cut and be included in those capital budgets, we would need a couple of -- 2 or 3, I don't want to say exactly -- it depends on which ones and how large, but we would need several major Subsea awards. It's hard to imagine getting to an equivalent 2015 Subsea inbound without a major Africa project. So those would have to come in, and that's how we get to the components of a 2016 Subsea inbound that's on par with 2015. The big question is whether or not are these big projects going to be included in the capital budgets, and we won't know that till later."

It doesn't mean that subsea processing technology in these projects aren't very, very compelling financially to the operators. They are.

Now that our pump is -- we've broken the ice in terms of our first award, and we're going to be -- we know that we're qualified with a number of operators.

Now what are we doing in response just because we can't -- it's not under our control how fast they adopt this. We're trying to make sure that we can act quickly to restructure our business during this uncertain period of time without jeopardizing our ability to execute and succeed when the market eventually comes back. And so far, based on the numbers we've seen and the baseload that we get from our partners, that we can achieve this. But you're right. I mean, there's uncertainty in terms of the level of activity, and we're watching that carefully. Right now, we think we've been able to balance the necessary restructuring yet keeping our core capability for when the recovery comes."

You recall 2.5 years ago, we received one of the largest Petrobras awards for pre-salt Christmas trees and pre-salt manifolds. That was a 4 years requirement. We got the bulk of the manifold awards and very large tree awards at that time. That backlog represents 17% of the company's entire backlog. There has been, clearly, pressure by Petrobras, in some cases, cancellation, although we've seen no cancellation. Instead, we have seen some rescheduling of that 4-year requirement of Petrobras. It was in our backlog. That actually worked to our favor. We were able to avoid some expansion cost and spread out the deliveries over a period that takes us through mid-2019, and we think that backlog will stay intact. Again, lots of pressure from Petrobras, but we think it'll stay intact. The margins have held up. There's a lot of pricing pressure. But largely, we think the margins will be able to hold up. And as a result, we see no risk of any type of impairment. We obviously are going through a major restructuring to resize ourselves, but we think we can use that Petrobras backlog to get us well into 2019. Now beyond that, we're obviously anticipating the market starts to improve in Brazil. But that's the story for us. We benefited by the large awards we won almost 3 years ago, and we can stretch those out into 2019 and size our organization accordingly."

With me today are Maryann Seaman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll discuss highlights from the quarter. Maryann will provide specifics on our financial performance, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Earnings were $0.61 per diluted share for the quarter excluding the impairment charges of $60.2 million and total company restructuring charges of $18 million. Total company quarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, and operating profit was $224 million, again, excluding the impairment and business restructuring charges. Quarterly revenue for Subsea Technologies was $1.1 billion with margins of 16.9%, excluding the Subsea business restructuring charges. Our focus on execution and the strength of our backlog continues to drive our strong margins. For the full year, we still expect Subsea margins excluding the restructuring charges of around 15%.
Our quarterly Subsea Technologies inbound orders totaled more than $1 billion for the second quarter in a row, bringing our year-to-date total to $2.6 billion. Improved deepwater project economics are imperative to ensure that this critical resource is available to meet the world's future hydrocarbon demand. Our focus on improved execution, standardization, innovative technology and the vendor-based integrated business models will both significantly and sustainably reduce cost and improve returns for deepwater developments. We recently announced awards for Statoil's Johan Sverdrup project in Norway and Shell's Appomattox project in the Gulf of Mexico. In the case of both of these awards, we collaborated closely with our customers to identify the most cost-effective solutions to improve project economics.
Given the awards achieved this quarter, the anticipated smaller orders next quarter and sustaining a strong level of subsea services activity, we have further confidence to achieve our targeted full year inbound guidance of at least $3 billion of inbound orders in 2015.
Based on the number of named future Subsea projects and the progress made on improving project economics, 2016 Subsea market activity has the potential to be on par with 2015. However, given the continued uncertainty of oil prices and capital spending by the operators, we lack the visibility to project Subsea orders for next year. Now despite this uncertainty, operators remain committed to deepwater. They're prioritizing capital spending towards production, and they've been successful in improving project economics, all of which support the future growth in subsea activity. 
Operators continue to show a willingness to accept vendor-based approaches versus the traditional client-specific requirements. An example of this is the addition of Chevron to our high-pressure, high-temperature joint industry program that was announced in July of last year. Our company, along with 5 operators, are collaborating to help solve the technical and economic deepwater challenges through standardization of materials, processes and interfaces.
We continue supporting our customers' producing assets by leveraging our installed footprint and technology leadership to improve project economics through cost savings and increased recovery. We've reached an agreement to produce a multiphase pump solution for Shell's BC-10 field in Brazil to replace the current separation and boosting modules. At this time, the agreement covers just the first boosting unit.
As we previously mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, the initial response from operators to Forsys Subsea, our joint venture with Technip, exceeded our expectations. Operators' acceptance of our vendor-based integrated approach at the concept stage as being both real and compelling is evident by the receipt of 2 integrated front-end engineering studies in this quarter. The commitment from these operators gives us further confidence that our alliance with Technip will be awarded an integrated EPC contract in 2016.
Turning to the performance of our Surface Technologies segment. Revenue remained flat sequentially as our surface wellhead business outside of North America performed well, offset by further weakness in our North American onshore business. Given the decline in the North America onshore activity, our fluid control orders remain well below historic levels. The North American rig count is expected to further deteriorate, and in response, customer spending remains depressed and pricing will remain under pressure. In light of this market outlook, we've taken aggressive action and continued to streamline our North American initiatives to improve our cost structure.
Our surface wellhead business outside of North America performed well in the quarter. We expect activity to remain similar to current levels as we end the year. However, we expect future months will begin to show the impact of pricing pressure as a result of a deteriorating global market. We're restructuring our operations in response to this weaker market.
In summary, we continue to see a challenged North America land market and do not expect any recovery as we go into 2016. We're taking aggressive action as we manage through this downturn to improve our operating effectiveness, and we continue to accelerate our strategic initiatives to improve our position in North American onshore market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver full year Subsea margins of around 15% excluding restructuring charges. We'll continue to strategically restructure our Subsea segment in line with anticipated activity levels and also in a way that allows us to sustainably operate with a leaner organization in anticipation of a market recovery.
During the quarter, we achieved important milestones in our effort to improve deepwater project economics through execution, standardization, technology and new business models. These milestones are also evidence of the industry's willingness to adopt real and compelling changes in how deepwater fields are developed. 
Maryann will now take you through the financial details of the quarter."

Before I review our operations, I would like to note, as announced on Monday, that our third quarter earnings results were negatively impacted by impairment charges, primarily in our Surface Technologies segment, of $0.20 per diluted share.",1194,"Thanks, John. Before I review our operations, I would like to note, as announced on Monday, that our third quarter earnings results were negatively impacted by impairment charges, primarily in our Surface Technologies segment, of $0.20 per diluted share. We also incurred business restructuring charges, mainly in the Subsea Technologies segment, of $0.06 per diluted share, as previously communicated. When excluding the impact of these 2 items, diluted earnings per share were $0.61 for the quarter. Our Subsea Technologies segment continued to deliver strong operating results as we executed well on our strong project backlog and cost-reduction initiatives are being realized. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $155 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit of $171 million in the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were negatively impacted by $27 million of foreign currency translation due to the strength of the dollar. 
Operating margins were 15.6%. We incurred business restructuring costs of $14.6 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and restructuring charges, operating profit was up approximately 4% year-over-year. As you may remember, we communicated on our last quarterly call that we expected to see costs in coming quarters for restructuring in Subsea -- our Subsea business. Excluding these costs, margins were 16.9%, a sequential improvement of 170 basis points when excluding the comparable charge in the second quarter. Our Subsea segment has yet to see a decline in activity, and in fact, absent the headwinds from the strength of the U.S. dollar, year-to-date Subsea revenue is actually up slightly from 2014. The actions we have taken throughout this year, including the significant actions in the third quarter, will help us develop a stronger and leaner organization as we prepare for the decline in activity in 2016. We have further restructuring within the organization -- we will have, excuse me, further restructuring within the organization in the fourth quarter. As we enter 2016, our Subsea organization headcount will be more reflective of the anticipated decrease in activity due to delayed Subsea project inbound. As we see 2016 activity, we will make further assessments on our operating structure. We anticipate an additional $6 million to $8 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. We continue to experience headwinds due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Looking at the first 3 quarters of 2015, the U.S. dollar is significantly stronger against currencies we have the greatest exposure to, but not the euro and the real. Subsea revenue for the first 9 months of 2015 includes more than $400 million of unfavorable impact, and operating profit includes more than $60 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Absent the foreign currency translation, total revenue year-to-date is slightly favorable year-over-year and operating profit year-to-date increased by approximately $45 million year-over-year.
Moving to our Surface Technology results. Surface Technology reported operating profits for the third quarter of $37 million excluding impairment charges of $58 million primarily related to our Canadian business and restructuring charges of $2 million. Excluding these costs, operating margins were 10.3%. These results represent continued strength in our non-North America surface wellhead business. As this is a later-cycle business compared to North America, we continue working off a healthy backlog and saw an increase in orders in the quarter. However, current pricing is beginning to reflect a more challenging environment. As John stated, we do not expect to see a recovery before next year in our North American businesses. As discussed in the last earnings call, we are continuing to reduce our operating cost structure for North America while integrating related products and services to deliver greater value to our customer. We expect these actions to continue through the fourth quarter and will result in further headcount reductions, with an expected cost of approximately $4 million to $6 million. These actions will continue to reduce cost and improve our competitive position as the market recovers. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $495 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Moving to our final segment. Energy Infrastructure revenue for the third quarter was $97 million. Operating loss for the segment was $2 million as our profitable Loading Systems results were more than offset by continued slower activity in our measurement solutions business. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $1.7 million. Given that lower activity levels are likely to continue, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter due to further headcount reductions.
Let me turn to our corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 million. We expect spending of approximately $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, including anticipated restructuring charges of approximately $3 million associated with headcount reductions. 
Other revenue and expense, net, reflects expense of $22 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect other revenue and expense to be approximately $15 million, with the potential for further foreign currency fluctuation increasing this amount. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 19.2% primarily due to a change in geographical earnings mix. We expect our 2015 full year tax rate to be between 24% and 26%, which includes the U.S. tax audit settlement discussed last quarter. 
Capital spending this quarter was $50 million. We expect capital spending in 2015 of approximately $250 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $583 million. It is comprised of $712 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We averaged 231 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock during the third quarter at an average cost of $33.95 per share. In summary, we expect total company restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of $15 million to $20 million. 
Looking forward, Energy Infrastructure revenue is now expected to be down more than 25% year-over-year, with full year margins in the mid-single digits negatively impacted by the poor results due to slower activity in our measurement solutions business. We no longer expect to see a recovery in this business in the next few quarters given that activity corresponds to the North American market. As indicated, we continue to take actions to improve performance. 
Surface Technologies revenue is expected to be down nearly 30% from last year due to reduced North American market activity. Full year operating margins will be approximately 10% excluding business restructuring and impairment charges as we will see continued pricing pressure. 
Subsea revenue for the full year should be approximately $4.6 billion as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to make a greater negative impact. Absent the headwinds, we are having our strongest year in Subsea revenues. We continue to expect Subsea margins excluding restructuring charges of around 15% as we execute well in our backlog and cost-reduction initiatives improve performance. The current market conditions are presenting a number of challenges to our near-term results. However, the actions related to the strategies we are implementing across our businesses will result in long-term cost savings while preserving our capabilities to improve our execution as the market recovers.

One of the things that we found of particular interest was that those projects that had not been started in terms of concept design and had maybe been sort of shelved in terms of the project economics were the ones that the operators seemed to have the most interest in applying the Forsys methodology. And the 2 FEED studies that we received the awards for, I think, both fit into that category. These are projects that may or may not have actually been able to go forward had it not been for this different approach. I'd like Doug to comment more, though, specifically on, overall, the interest that we've had on the FEED studies and these 2 awards that we've got, a little bit more color on what was behind them.

David, you may recall, last quarter, we talked about a wide range of interest, interest from partners as well as non-partners, interest from independents as well as IOCs and NOCs and also that the approach we were finding had great applicability on both greenfields as well as brownfields. So if we look at these 2 awards that we're discussing today, it actually fits into that category. So the first was for an independent operator who was a non-partner, and this is a greenfield approach. This is actually at the concept stage. So in this particular case, the value proposition was, by aligning and having early engagement, making a commitment to partners and close collaboration that they would be able to take anywhere from 18 to 24 months off of first oil delivery. So that was the real value proposition, whilst at the same time, recognizing and experiencing the savings that will come from a vendor-based, integrated, front-end engineering project. So that was one example. The other example was for an IOC, a partner, and in this case, a brownfield application. If you will, this is a field that's going to tie back to an existing host. In this particular example, we got involved at the FEED stage -- or we are involved at the FEED stage, I should say. And yes, this project, I would say, had some economical hurdles that needed to be overcome. The customer recognized 2 things that, by using this approach, one, they had the very real possibility of overcoming those economical hurdles, which we certainly expect to be the result. And in addition, they saw this as a way to change the behavior within their own company by changing the approach to, one, early engagement; two, committing to doing an integrated project and an integrated delivery of that project or, if you will, an integrated EPC project. And this is really a change in behavior, and this was a catalyst for us receiving that award. So 2 very different projects with different characteristics, but again, it demonstrates the very broad interest that we are receiving in our integrated approach along with our partner, Technip."

We said earlier that there was a -- the interest exceeded our expectations from the full range of operators, including even NOCs, all geographies, as Doug said, greenfield and brownfield. It suggests that the breadth of the interest and application of this different approach could apply to virtually all deepwater projects.

It's a combination of both the ability to do the integrated planning and execution and the cost savings associated with that as well as the introduction of different technologies. But most importantly, it's removing components, actual hardware, from the subsea field design by working together early with the SURF provider, with Technip, to be able to look at ways that we can streamline the interfaces between the umbilical risers and flow lines in our traditional subsea production system, thus physically removing and permanently lowering the cost of subsea field developments. And that's really where the -- what the objective is. Now on top of that, absolutely, we're going to see benefits, and the benefits are going to come from the integrated planning and execution, better delivery, improved execution. As John has mentioned many times, the execution in subsea projects has been not great over a long period of time for our industry, and this is a way for us to address that as well. The introduction of new technology will come over time. Just to remind everyone, the actual relationship is just slightly over 120 days old, and we continue -- we do have a robust plan for the development of new technology.

And then you're assuming something close to like $1 billion in major projects in '16, assuming the fourth quarter of this year comes in at close to what you did in the third. And so when you get to that math, I'm just curious about the major project composition. We've been talking about Greater Western Flank here for a while, talking about Cobalt and Cameia. We've been talking about Mad Dog Phase 2. The one that's the biggest one which seems to be slipping, at least based upon the fact that you're not upsized relative to '15, is Bonga South West.

We think in 2016, the installation portion of that will hold up. We think some of the maybe discretionary services, because of CapEx cutbacks, will face some headwinds, so we might come under our past run rate, but figure $1 billion-plus, $1.5 billion, something under $1.5 billion could be our subsea service number potentially. On the small onesie-twosies, the third quarter number that you referenced is too high. We had fairly -- we're watching the onesie-twosies very closely because we think that the Gulf of Mexico market will probably hold up better in this downturn than any of the other markets, and we have a very strong position. In Q1, the small orders particularly coming out of the Gulf of Mexico were very, very light. In the second quarter, they were very strong. In the third quarter, they were not strong. They weren't as light as the first quarter, but they were close to it. So we think that the onesie-twosies are demonstrating a kind of lumpy characteristic that's kind of becoming a little hard to project. But in 2016, we'd expect -- I mean, it's not going to go 0. It's not going to look like Q1 of 2015 but probably continue to look like an average of 2015, so that would make up a number for 2016. And then we would have to win, as we did in 2015, several major awards. And this is where I showed my caution because not knowing capital budgets, not knowing whether or not these major projects will be included in the 2016 capital budget, it's hard to predict. But assuming that they would make the cut and be included in those capital budgets, we would need a couple of -- 2 or 3, I don't want to say exactly -- it depends on which ones and how large, but we would need several major Subsea awards. It's hard to imagine getting to an equivalent 2015 Subsea inbound without a major Africa project. So those would have to come in, and that's how we get to the components of a 2016 Subsea inbound that's on par with 2015. The big question is whether or not are these big projects going to be included in the capital budgets, and we won't know that till later."

So yes, stickiness to all the good execution we have, really just a little bit of timing between 3 and 4. And then again, we're seeing an early slowing, if you will, or contract removal on the Light Well Intervention."

I think in the near term, the next year or so, we've got to put subsea processing projects in the pace of which they're awarded and pursued in the context of a pullback on capital spending, on operators redirecting their capital spending towards production, certain projects that are in the queue that, for various strategic reasons, they want to proceed with, all in the context of a smaller capital budget. It doesn't mean that subsea processing technology in these projects aren't very, very compelling financially to the operators. They are. But I think we should assume that they're going to go a little bit on the back burner for the next year because of the capital constraints. There are several projects that are out there. Now that our pump is -- we've broken the ice in terms of our first award, and we're going to be -- we know that we're qualified with a number of operators. We're going to be pursuing other pump projects, but I think there might be a temporary slowing in the pace of Subsea projects in the next year or so just because of the prioritization of projects in the capital budgets. But as you can appreciate, we are very encouraged that we broke through getting our pump qualified last year. Now we've broken through getting our first award. We're going to -- we're now competing in the processing market, and that market will come. Absolutely, it will come. The economics are very compelling. I just think that the pressure on capital budgets will have an impact on the near-term pace of projects that go forward in processing."

I think you're right. For the NOCs to go from interest to actual implementation as opposed to the 2 clients that Doug discussed and the awards, it's going to come later because they have natural hurdles they have to overcome.

We were able to avoid some expansion cost and spread out the deliveries over a period that takes us through mid-2019, and we think that backlog will stay intact.
