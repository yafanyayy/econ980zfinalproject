Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2014. I'm pleased to report, actually I'm more than pleased to report that 2014 was a year which we continue to make progress on our p",1078,"Thanks, Kathleen. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2014. I'm pleased to report, actually I'm more than pleased to report that 2014 was a year which we continue to make progress on our plans to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.49 per share which equal the $0.49 per share earned in 2013's fourth quarter, bringing results for the full year to $2.76 per share or 7% greater than 2013's operating earnings of $2.58 per share. And it was above our guidance of $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Our results are benefiting from disciplined capital allocation. PSE&G, our utility, achieved double-digit growth in earnings, adding to our track record of 5 years of 18% compound annual growth. As a result of a expended capital program, earnings from our regulated company grew to represent 52% of our consolidated operating earnings as PSE&G's investment in transmission has grown to represent 39% of its $11.4 billion rate base. PSEG Power successful management of its operations, including it's gas supply arrangements, supported earnings in excess of guidance for the full year and delivered substantial savings to PSE&G's customers. 
In addition to being a successful year for delivering on our earnings, we achieved success in many areas that will provide a lasting foundation for customer satisfaction and shareholder value. By way of a reminder, we received an approval to invest $1.2 billion in Energy Strong, a program that will improve the resiliency of our electric and gas distribution systems. We have begun the work of replacing and modernizing 250 miles of gas pipe and have begun the engineering and scheduling associated with upgrading and enhancing our electric substations. The investments under the Energy Strong Program, as you will recall, will take place over a period of 3 to 5 years. We're also executing well on our Transmission investment program. We completed construction of 2 230 kilovolt transmission lines during the year, as well as the New Jersey portion of the 500 kV Susquehanna Roseland landline. We expect the full Susquehanna Roseland to go into service this year when the Pennsylvania portion of SR is completed. The investment in transmission will support the reliable service our customers have come to expect and provide an important boost to New Jersey's economy as it also adds to PSE&G's growth. PSE&G once again was named the Mid-Atlantic region's most reliable electric utility, this is the 13th consecutive year that PSE&G's capabilities have been recognized. In addition to that, for the first time in its history, PSE&G received J.D. Power's award for highest customer satisfaction for both electric and gas business service among large utilities in the region. This recognition, while important in itself we think recognizes that PSE&G has always kept the needs of its customers uppermost as we pursue our major growth initiatives. 
But 2014 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced at record level as Powers' fossil fleet achieved the safety performance in the top 10% of the industry. We successfully grew PSEG Solar Source's portfolio. In 2014, we headed projects in 3 states that expanded Solar Source's portfolio to 123 megawatts of clean renewable energy. And we had a successful first year of operating the electric system of the Long Island Power Authority. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts of our PSEG Long Island team where we are awarded with a major improvement in customer satisfaction scores. But let me be clear, this is only the beginning of a multiyear journey for us on Long Island. 
Our core strategy, focused on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment is anticipated to yield a third year of growth in operating earnings over the coming year. For 2015, we are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission is expected to support continued growth in operating earnings in '15, as PSE&G's results for the full year are expected to represent more than 50% of consolidated earnings. PSEG Power is expected to report operating earnings in line with its strong 2014 results. The investments made by PSEG Power are expected to enhance the competitiveness of its environmentally well-positioned fleet, capacity upgrades at our gas-fired combined cycle fleet and in our nuclear units will increase the fleet's output as Power's investment in the PennEast Pipeline enhances its already strong actions to low-cost gas for the Marcellus region. PSEG Power's fleet has the characteristics envisioned by PJM's proposed standards for capacity performance, its diversity and dispatch and fuel mix, as well as the [indiscernible] fuel capability mitigates operating risk. Power's investment program will focus on improving its reliability during periods of stress on  the system. We also look to expand the fleet when financially attractive. We were disappointed that our bids construct a new 475-megawatt combined cycle plant at our Bridgeport Harbor site at Connecticut didn't clear the New England [indiscernible] recent capacity auction. However, we have not abandoned this work and will invest when the market supports its development. 
The strategy we implemented has yielded growth. We have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that will support further expansion of our capital program over the next 5 years. The program is expected to yield double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base as we maintain the operating strength of Power's generating assets. We will update you on our capital spending plans on March 2. Our financial position remains strong and acknowledgment of our success and the strength of our platform going forward was the recent decision by our Board of Directors to meaningfully increase the common dividend by 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend given our business mix, our continued positive cash flow from our generation business and our strong financial position all support this dividend philosophy. We've made significant strides in meeting our objectives for growth as we also satisfy customer requirements, and we're not done. Of course, none of this would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated employees to our continued success. 
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you at our March 2 annual financial conference. I will now turn the call over to Caroline for more details on our results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after her remarks."
298482,282460080,767304,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2015",2015-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter were",3004,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter were operating earnings for the full year to $2.76 per share versus operating earnings for 2013 of $2.58 per share or 7% growth. 
On Slide 4, we have provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. And as you can see on Slide 10, PSE&G provided the largest contribution to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share last year. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share last year. Enterprise Other reported a small loss in operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.01 per share versus the operating loss of $0.03 per share reported in the fourth quarter of '13. We've provided you with waterfall charts on Slide 11 and 13 to take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings by major business. 
So now I review each company in a bit more detailed, starting with PSE&G. As I mentioned, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $0.32 per share compared with $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 as we show on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2014 operating earnings were $725 million or $1.43 per share compared with operating earnings of $612 million or $1.21 per share for 2013 for growth of 18%. PSE&G's earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from lower operating expenses including pension, and a return on its expanded capital infrastructure program which more than offset the impact of mild weather on sales. 
PSE&G's investment in transmission infrastructure increased its quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. The earnings improvement related to the investment in transmission in the fourth quarter was less than the earnings increases you've seen during each of the first 3 quarters of the year, and this reflects the reduction in PSE&G's rate base at year-end associated with the deferred tax impact of the expansion of bonus depreciation. PSE&G tight control of its operating expenses, including lower pension expense, resulted in a quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings of $0.04 per share. The continued improvement in weather-normalized gas volume and demand, which improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, was offset by a similar decline in electric volume and demand. And although you wouldn't think on a day like today, weather was actually mild relative to normal and relative for the prior year and that reduced earnings comparisons by about $0.01 per share.  Earnings comparisons were also affected by the absence of $0.02 per share of tax-related change which benefited earnings in the prior year. Economic conditions continued to exhibit signs of an improvement in the service area which is good news. On a weather normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 1% in the quarter and 3.1% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from a decline in the cost of gas, which is passed on to our residential customers, and an improvement in economic growth. 
PSE&G announced earlier this month that it would extend through March of 2015 the credits against gas builds that it has already provided to the residential customers for the months of November, December and January. A typical residential customer with these credits would experience savings on their total bill over the 5 months of approximately 31% or $210. Electric sales on a weather normalized basis are estimated to have declined 2.3% in the fourth quarter. The decline in the quarter reflects a number of winter storms at the end of 2013 that increased residential consumption in that year, as well as decreases in demand this quarter from some large industrial customers. By the way, weather normalization is generally good for temperature but unfortunately, there's not really a good way to adjust for storms. Overall, there was a 0.3% increase in weather-normalized electric demand for the year, which we think is indicative of improving economic conditions, partially offset by continued customer conservation. 
PSE&G implemented an increase in transmission revenue of $182 million effective on January 1 of this year. the increase in revenue under PSE&G's Transmission formula rate will provide PSE&G with recovery of and a return on its forecast of transmission-related capital expenditures through the year. PSE&G's investment in transmission grew to $4.5 billion at the end of 2014 or 39% of the company's consolidated rate base of $11.4 billion, and transmission is forecast to be well over 40% of rate base as we go forward. 
Let me just mention the impact of bonus depreciation. Expansion of bonus depreciation has the effect of reducing PSE&G's transmission-related rate base with an increase in deferred taxes. We estimate PSE&G's transmission-related rate base was reduced by approximately $150 million to $200 million from prior forecast levels, and this is reflected in PSE&G's year end rate base of $11.4 billion. The impact of this change on 2015 revenues is not reflected in the formula rate increase that I just went through as that filing took place prior to the enactment of the extension of bonus depreciation. But our guidance for PSE&G reflects the impact on revenue associated with the extension of bonus depreciation and we estimate that impact to be approximately $21 million. As you know, this is really a timing-related issue. We get the benefit of an increase in cash over the short term and see a decrease in the deferred tax balance over the long-term. 
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 are forecasted to grow to $735 million to $775 million. Our forecast for 2015 reflects the continued growth in PSE&G transmission-related rate base and the expansion of PSE&G's investment in distribution through the Energy Strong Program. Earnings for the full year will also be affected by a forecast increase in pension expense that will affect O&M, and I'll go into a little more detail on that shortly. We expect PSE&G's rate of earnings growth to improve beyond 2015 as the impact of bonus depreciation will annualize and pension expense is expected to be lower under long-term return and interest rate assumptions. 
PSE&G invested approximately $2.2 billion in 2014 on capital projects that improve the system's resilience and maintain its reliability. We currently forecast an increase in PSE&G's average capital spending for the next 3 years to about $2.4 billion per year. PSE&G's investment in transmission will represent more than 50% of this new spending. We will be providing you with an updated forecast of PSE&G's capital expenditures by year for the 5-year period ending 2019 at our annual financial conference on March 2 of this year, and I can tell you that spending plan remains robust. 
Now let's turn to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $642 million or $1.27 per share compared to 2013's operating earnings of $710 million or $1.40 per share. The earnings release as well as Slides 11 and 13 provides you with detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and costs. We've also provided you with more detail on generation on the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. Power's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were influence by the known decline in capacity revenues that we've discussed in prior calls, the monetization of Power's gas supply position and a reduction in operating and maintenance expense helped mitigate the effects of lower market prices for energy. As you recall, the average price for our PJM capacity declined to $166 per megawatt day from $244 per megawatt day on June 1 of 2014. The decline in price reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. A decline in the average hedge price for energy that Power realized during the quarter relative to year ago levels and lower market prices on Power's open position were more than offset by Power's ability to monetize its gas supply position. These items together led to an improvement in quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. A decline in Power's O&M expenditures during the quarter improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share. And the decline in expense for the quarter was greater than what we have been forecasting at the end of the third quarter. Power's management of maintenance outages at fossil stations, coupled with the absence of outage-related expenditures in the prior year resulted in a better than forecast reduction in O&M expense for the fourth year -- for the fourth quarter and led overall to lower O&M expense in 2014 versus the full year of 2013. 
Now, let's turn to the operations. Power's output increased 3.1% in the quarter from year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 1.3% to 54.2 terawatt hours. The fleet's flexibility and response to volatile market conditions was demonstrated in the quarter and throughout the year. The level of production achieved by the fleet in 2014 represented the third-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator. The nuclear fleet produced 29.1 terawatt hours or 54% of generation, operating at an average capacity factor of 89.3%. Hope Creek experienced its second best year, operating at a 97.9 annual capacity factor, which helped to offset the impact of the extended refueling outage at Salem 2 earlier in 2014. The market is clearly rewarding efficient combined cycle gas units and Power's combined cycle fleet set a generation record during the year. The fleet produced 16.5 terawatt hours or 30% of our generation during the year, with record levels of output from the Bergen station and Linden unit 1. The coal fleet produced 7.4 terawatt hours or 14% of generation and the peaking fleet's responsiveness to market conditions, particularly the abnormally cold weather experienced at the start of 2014, led to full year production of 1.2 terawatt hours. Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower priced gas supplies in the Marcellus basin. For the year, gas from the Marcellus-Utica region supplied approximately 60% of the PJM asset's fuel requirements. This represent a larger percentage of the fleet's gas supply that was available in the past. Power's ability to step up the acquisition of gas from the Western Marcellus and Utica basin in addition to the use of backhaul arrangements on existing pipe in the Eastern Marcellus improved its access to this low-cost resource. The supply supports higher spark spreads and implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings similar to the levels it enjoyed in 2013 despite the decline in energy prices. 
Overall, Power's gross margin per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter was $37.40 versus $45.90 last year, which was driven by the capacity price reset. For the year, gross margin amounted to $42.41 per megawatt hour versus $47.10 per megawatt hour last year and Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margin for the quarter and the year. Power's forecasting a further improvement in output in 2015 to 55 to 57 terawatt hours. The increase is primarily the result of investments we have made to expand the capacity of our Nuclear and Combined Cycle fleet. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has hedged 100% of its baseload generation in 2015 and has hedged approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated total production for 2015 at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour, which compares favorably to the average hedge prices in 2014 of $48 per megawatt hour. Power had hedged approximately 50% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2016, estimated at 55 to 57 terawatt hours, also at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and '16 assumes BGS volumes represent approximately 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries, about comparable to the 11.5 we delivered in 2014 under BGS. 
Based on our current hedge position for 2015, each $2 change in spark spreads will impact earnings by only $0.04 per share. This modest impact on earnings as a result of a higher percentage of output from our intermediate and peaking fleet that is hedged at this time about 40% to 45% than we had hedged a year ago when it was really about 35% to 40% of forecasted output for the intermediate and peaking fleet. For 2016, a $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by $0.06 per share, and just for your reference, if we were fully open, the $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by about $0.24 per share. 
The BGS auction for PSE&G customers for the 3-year period beginning June 1 of 2015 and ending on May 31, 2018, was priced at $99.54 per megawatt hour. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the contract for $83.88 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31 of this year. This latest auction is based on an average price for energy at the PJM-West hub of about $37 to $38 per megawatt hour, which is similar to the base price for energy seen in the last 2 auctions. The BGS auction continues to represent a key means for Power to hedge basis associated with baseload output. 
Power's hedging strategy is consistent with what you've seen in the past. Power maintains open positions on a portion of its intermediate and load following assets, and this allows Power to capture any benefits associated with weather-related demand in the summer months and contain the risks associated with Full Requirements Contracts like BGS. Power took advantage of market strength earlier in 2014 to hedge its output. And given favorable pricing, Power is also committed to serve a larger percentage of load under the BGS contract in this latest auction which of course will have its proportional impact across the upcoming 3 years. 
Power's operating earnings for 2015 are forecast at $620 million to $680 million. We're very pleased that our anticipated result are essentially in line with 2014's operating results. Comparative results for the full year will be affected by a decline in capacity revenues, which will essentially be fully offset by an increase in the average price received on energy hedges and a modest increase in O&M. 
Turning to Enterprise and Other, PSEG Enterprise Other reported an operating earnings loss for the fourth quarter of $4 million or about $0.01 per share, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. The results of the fourth quarter brought full year 2014 operating earnings to $33 million or $0.06 per share compared with 2013's operating loss of $13 million or $0.03 per share. The difference in operating results quarter-over-quarter reflects primarily the options of tax payment and other items which contributed $0.03 per share relative to the fourth quarter of 2013. 
For 2015, operating earnings are forecasted to fall within the range of $40 million to $45 million, and results will be influenced by the contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG Long Island, income on the lease portfolio including the benefit from the renegotiation and extension of our lease on the Grand Gulf nuclear generating facility. 
Let me now just add a word about pension expense. Last year as you recall, we saw total pension income of about $0.02 per share and the success of our investment strategy created that pension income. In 2015, our funding level remains greater than 90%, but a lower discount rate and changes to mortality tables offset the continued strong return we generated on the trust resulting in net pension expense of slightly less than $0.07 per share, which is split about evenly between PSE&G and Power. Keep in mind these are noncash charges and we anticipate a move back to pension income over the next 2 to 3-year period given our solid funding and our long-term investment strategy. These impacts that I just mentioned are embedded in our financial plan and our guidance for growth at PSE&G and consistent performance in 2015 at Power. We still see a low-single digit growth in O&M across the company over the 3-year horizon, and we'll talk more about that in greater detail on March 2. 
Lastly, just a word on our financial position, we're in great shape to finance our capital program. At the end of 2014, we had $402 million of cash on hand and debt represented about 42% of our consolidated capital position with debted Power approximating 31% of its capital base and no parent debt. We'll be updating you on our capital program at our annual financial conference, but the message is the same. We can finance our robust long-term capital program and pursue a very healthy amount of growth opportunities without the need to issue equity as we also provide our shareholders with a meaningful increase in the growth of the common dividend on a sustainable basis. We're pleased to be guiding to another year of anticipated growth in earnings for 2015 of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. Our forecast continues to reflect the benefits from PSE&G's expanded capital program and the dynamics of Power's fleet and access to low-cost gas supplies. 
As you know, the common dividend was recently increased 5.4% to the indicated annual level of $1.56 per share and we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward. 
With that, Randy, I'll turn it back to you, and we're now ready for your questions."

We look for asset acquisitions, we look for opportunities to repower sites, we look for opportunities to expand or increase the output of our plans. As you all know, we've been more successful on the latter and not as successful on the former. So Peach Bottom upgrade, advanced gas path improvements, a couple of peakers here and there, have not been able to see the same price justification as others on asset acquisitions and similar thing happened in New England. In general, we like the New England markets from the point of view of newbuild for the 7 [ph] years, that's bigger hurdle to overcome in PJM because of the 1 year price. On the regular utility side, we'll give you more detail in a second, but it's still very much a robust capital program that we'll be showing you for the 5 years, not just in terms of transmission, which has been #1, but as we've talked about in the past, opportunities to accelerate the replacement of our gas fired main system in the gas business, as well as some of the components of the Energy Master Plan that relate to energy efficiencies and renewables. You may recall it's only been 10 months or so, so I'm not suggesting we're done by any means, but Energy Strong was a much bigger program than what was ultimately approved so there'll be more of that. But that's a little bit longer term than in the next coming months. So there's no shortage of opportunities to deploying capital. We are disappointed of Bridgeport Harbor, I'm not going to deny that but we've got things we can do."

The winter is where most of the volatility and earnings potential for Power is coming from. And that hasn't changed since we started talking about that now almost 2 seasons ago. So when you look at basis for the year, that's a little bit of a misleading view of the world. It's a combination of modern basis in the summer, very strong basis in the winter and weak basis, in fact, negative basis in the shoulder periods. But the flexibility of our fleet and the way in which we hedge it takes all of that into account. Over the longer-term, I think what you're going to see is the market dynamic that's going to be driven by significant infrastructure build of gas pipes from the Marcellus region to the Southeast and significant replacement of aging power plants that are unable to meet environmental standards in the Southeast with highly efficient natural gas combined cycle. So we don't run the business the same that we're smarter than the market, but to the extent that the market's view doesn't extend to the 3 to 5-year timeframe, we still have lots of reasons to feel pretty confident in the location and quality of our asset base."

I cited the base load and the total and keep in mind that intermediate and peaking right. So if you look at what we told you in the third quarter call, we were still 100% hedged at the base load, but the differences really occurred as we've added hedges in that intermediate and peaking which was 5% to 10% for 2015 on the last call and is now 40% to 45%. Now of course, a piece of that would be BGS, but if you do the math on that, you'll see that's a little less than half of the total on an estimated basis and really what's going on Dan, if you look at the curves, we look at the forward price curve, you can see that there were opportunities where the prices moved up during the last quarter before they came down right at the very end and spark spreads have been pretty robust. And so we took advantage of those opportunities to layer on incremental hedges and by having that incremental flexibility and putting on a little bit more and capturing those price in sparks for opportunities, that's what's really increased the numbers. Now if you're asking about the change in the price of base load, you know that we actually get one consistent price across. So even though base load is 100%, the average price of the entirety of the book, we put that across all the hedges but we give you the granularity of where we're hedged between base load and intermediate and peaking. So we like the impact that we had in the fourth quarter by adding on hedges. You know that BGS of course being full requirements also has some passthrough costs. But even if you strip that out, you find the the hedges are really higher than they were from our last report."

But I think, I know for us and I suspect for others, there was some operational changes we were able to make, to reduce the amount of forced outages. Just in line of the forecast, we moved our whole piles around a little bit more so that we made sure that we don't face them freezing up. But what hasn't changed for us, and I suspect for others, the amount of capital investment that's being made in the older units which basically never run until you get 6 days averaging 16 degrees below 0. And I think FERC is very cognizant of that. So there's only so much you can get out of improved performance by doing some operational prep work and eventually the frictional forces that these temperatures overcome whatever you might do in terms of preparation and those capital improvements are needed. So I think FERC would be supportive, I don't want to predict any outcome, I don't want to guarantee an outcome, but suffice to say that there's really 2 issues that are evolving, making sure power plant will run it's what you physically have put into the asset and what you do to ready it. And in terms of physical preparation, not leaving copilots exposed, putting buildings around them so that they're protected from the elements. That's a capital investment, and you're not going to do that unless you know that you're going to get paid in the capacity market because those typically, in our case, at least [indiscernible] capture energy margin.

So the pure Energy Strong filing, if you will, had multiple components to it. There were a series of substations, for example, that were a centerpiece of it, I think there were 29 that have to be upgraded. And there what we are is we're in the engineering and design phase of that work. So that work is probably going to be the longest dated one and when we do file for additional help in that area, that's likely to not be offered at least another year. Another big part of Energy Strong though was a $350 million program to replace some of the gas fired main system. I think we've got over 200 miles of that already. And that is one that is scheduled to pretty much wind down by the end of '15. So we'll talk more in detail about that on March 2, but that is filing that we will be making in very, very short order to continue that program. That's important for a whole host of reasons not the least which is number one, you don't want to keep mobilizing and then demobilizing a workforce to do that. And as I said, that's winding down at the end of the year. What's probably equal, if not more important, is the fact that we've continued to be able to task these gas credits onto our customers. So this is the time to make the investment in the infrastructure while the supply part of the bill is actually coming down. Because it's something that the customer can afford to do right now. We're always mindful of the burden that we're putting on the customer. But there are some other parts of Energy Strong that are smaller in magnitude, but those being the 2 biggest ones. Some of the things may talk about in terms of potential investments that we're still waiting to hear on, or the utility 2.0 program out on Long Island candidly we thought that will be resolved right now, but it looks like it's going to go out a couple of more quarters into this year. We had thought we were the winner of the FERC 1000 project out on Fisher Island. As you know, PJM is reconsidering that and I don't know exactly when the decision will be forthcoming there. We thought it would be Q1, but Q1 is now halfway gone and that decision isn't done. The PennEast Pipeline investment we've made is still underway. The energy efficiency filing that we made is still having very constructive dialogue with the staff on that. So there are things in all manner, all different stages from a disappointment in terms of Bridgeport Harbor, optimism in terms of energy efficiency and a whole bunch of stuff in between."

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2014. I'm pleased to report, actually I'm more than pleased to report, that 2014 was the year which we continued to make progress on our plans to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.49 per share which equal the $0.49 per share earned in 2013's fourth quarter, bringing results for the full year to $2.76 per share, or 7% greater than 2013's operating earnings of $2.58 per share. And it was above our guidance of $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Our results are benefiting from disciplined capital allocation. PSE&G, our utility, achieved double-digit growth in earnings, adding to our track record of 5 years of 18% compound annual growth. As a result of an expended capital program, earnings from our regulated company grew to represent 52% of our consolidated operating earnings as PSE&G's investment in transmission has grown to represent 39% of its $11.4 billion rate base. PSEG Power successful management of its operations, including its gas supply arrangements, supported earnings in excess of guidance for the full year and delivered substantial savings to PSE&G's customers.
In addition to being a successful year for delivering on earnings, we achieved success in many areas that will provide a lasting foundation for customer satisfaction and shareholder value. By way of a reminder, we received approval to invest $1.2 billion in Energy Strong, a program that will improve the resiliency of our electric and gas distribution systems. We have begun the work on replacing and modernizing 250 miles of gas pipe and have begun the engineering and scheduling associated with upgrading and enhancing our electric substations. The investments under the Energy Strong Program, as you will recall, will take place over a period of 3 to 5 years. We're also executing well on our Transmission investment program. We completed construction of 2 230 kilovolt transmission lines during the year, as well as the New Jersey portion of the 500 kV Susquehanna Roseland line. We expect the full Susquehanna Roseland line to go into service this year when the Pennsylvania portion of SR is completed. The investment in Transmission will support the reliable service our customers have come to expect and provide an important boost to New Jersey's economy as it also adds to PSE&G's growth. PSE&G once again was named the mid-Atlantic region's most reliable electric utility. This is the 13th consecutive year that PSE&G's capabilities have been recognized. In addition to that, for the first time in its history, PSE&G received J.D. Power's award for highest customer satisfaction for both electric and gas business service among large utilities in the region. This recognition, while important in itself, we think recognizes that PSE&G has always kept the needs of its customers uppermost as we pursue our major growth initiatives.
But 2014 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced at record levels as Powers' fossil fleet achieved the safety performance in the top 10% of the industry. We successfully grew PSEG Solar Source's portfolio. In 2014, we headed projects in 3 states that expanded Solar Source's portfolio to 123 megawatts of clean renewable energy. And we had a successful first year of operating the electric system of the Long Island Power Authority. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts of our PSEG Long Island team where we're awarded with a major improvement in customer satisfaction scores. But let me be clear, this is only the beginning of a multiyear journey for us on Long Island.
Our core strategy, focused on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, is anticipated to yield a third year of growth in operating earnings over the coming year. For 2015, we are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission is expected to support continued growth in operating earnings in '15, as PSE&G's results for the full year are expected to represent more than 50% of consolidated earnings. PSEG Power is expected to report operating earnings in line with its strong 2014 results. The investments made by PSEG Power are expected to enhance the competitiveness of its environmentally well-positioned fleet. Capacity upgrades at our gas-fired combined cycle fleet and in our nuclear units will increase the fleet's output as Power's investment in the PennEast Pipeline enhances its already strong actions to low-cost gas for the Marcellus region. PSEG Power's fleet has the characteristics envisioned by PJM's proposed standards for capacity performance, its diversity and dispatch and fuel mix, as well as the alternate fuel capability, mitigates operating risk. Power's investment program will be focused on improving its reliability during periods of stress on  the system. We also look to expand the fleet when it's financially attractive. We were disappointed that our bid to construct a new 475-megawatt combined cycle plant at our Bridgeport Harbor site in Connecticut didn't clear the New England [indiscernible] capacity auction. However, we haven't abandoned this work, and we'll invest when the markets support its development.
The strategy we implemented has yielded growth. We have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that will support further expansion of our capital program over the next 5 years. The program is expected to yield double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base as we maintain the operating strength of Power's generating assets. We will update you on our capital spending plans on March 2. Our financial position remains strong, and acknowledgment of our success and the strength of our platform going forward was the recent decision by our Board of Directors to meaningfully increase the common dividend by 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend given our business mix. Our continued positive cash flow from our generation business and our strong financial position all support this dividend philosophy. We've made significant strides in meeting our objectives for growth as we also satisfy customer requirements, and we're not done. Of course, none of this would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated employees to our continued success.
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you in our March 2 annual financial conference.
I will now turn the call over to Caroline for more details on our results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after her remarks."
298482,282460080,767510,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2015",2015-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter bro",3002,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.76 per share versus operating earnings for 2013 of $2.58 per share, or 7% growth.
On Slide 4, we have provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. And as you can see on Slide 10, PSE&G provided the largest contribution to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share last year. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share last year. Enterprise Other reported a small loss in operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.01 per share versus the operating loss of $0.03 per share reported in the fourth quarter of '13. We've provided you with waterfall charts on Slides 11 and 13 to take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings by major business.
So now I'll review each company in a bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. As I mentioned, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $0.32 per share compared with $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 as we show on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2014 operating earnings were $725 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with operating earnings of $612 million, or $1.21 per share for 2013, for growth of 18%. PSE&G's earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from lower operating expenses, including pension, and a return on its expanded capital infrastructure program, which more than offset the impact of mild weather on sales.
PSE&G's investment in Transmission infrastructure increased its quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. The earnings improvement related to the investment in Transmission in the fourth quarter was less than the earnings increases you've seen during each of the first 3 quarters of the year, and this reflects a reduction in PSE&G's rate base at year-end associated with the deferred tax impact of the expansion of bonus depreciation. PSE&G's tight control of its operating expenses, including lower pension expense, resulted in a quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings of $0.04 per share. The continued improvement in weather-normalized gas volume and demand, which improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, was offset by a similar decline in electric volume and demand. And although you wouldn't think it on a day like today, weather was actually mild relative to normal and relative to the prior year, and that reduced earnings comparisons by about $0.01 per share. Earnings comparisons were also affected by the absence of $0.02 per share to tax-related change, which benefited earnings in the prior year.
Economic conditions continued to exhibit signs of an improvement in the service area which is good news. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 1% in the quarter and 3.1% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from a decline in the cost of gas, which is passed on to our residential customers, and an improvement in economic growth.
PSE&G announced earlier this month that it would extend through March of 2015 the credits against gas bills that it had already provided to residential customers for the months of November, December and January. A typical residential customer with these credits would experience savings on their total bill over the 5 months of approximately 31%,  or $210.
Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have declined 2.3% in the fourth quarter. The decline in the quarter reflects a number of winter storms at the end of 2013 that increased residential consumption in that year, as well as decreases in demand this quarter from some large industrial customers. By the way, weather normalization is generally good for temperature, but unfortunately, there's not really a good way to adjust for storms. Overall, there was a 0.3% increase in weather-normalized electric demand for the year, which we think is indicative of improving economic conditions, partially offset by continued customer conservation.
PSE&G implemented an increase in Transmission revenue of $182 million effective on January 1 of this year. The increase in revenue under PSE&G's Transmission formula rate will provide PSE&G with recovery of and a return on its forecast of Transmission-related capital expenditures through the year. PSE&G's investment in Transmission grew to $4.5 billion at the end of 2014, or 39% of the company's consolidated rate base of $11.4 billion, and transmission is forecast to be well over 40% of rate base as we go forward.
Let me just mention the impact of bonus depreciation. Expansion of bonus depreciation has the effect of reducing PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base with an increase in deferred taxes. We estimate PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base was reduced by approximately $150 million to $200 million from prior forecast levels, and this is reflected in PSE&G's year-end rate base of $11.4 billion. The impact of this change on 2015 revenues is not reflected in the formula rate increase that I just went through as that filing took place prior to the enactment of the extension of bonus depreciation. But our guidance for PSE&G reflects the impact on revenue associated with the extension of bonus depreciation, and we estimate that impact to be approximately $21 million. As you know, this is really a timing-related issue. We get the benefit of an increase in cash over the short term and see a decrease in the deferred tax balance over the long term.
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 are forecasted to grow to $735 million to $775 million. Our forecast for 2015 reflects the continued growth in PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base and the expansion of PSE&G's investment in distribution through the Energy Strong Program. Earnings for the full year will also be affected by a forecast increase in pension expense that will affect O&M, and I'll go into a little more detail on that shortly. We expect PSE&G's rate of earnings growth to improve beyond 2015 as the impact of bonus depreciation will annualize, and pension expense is expected to be lower under long-term return and interest rate assumptions.
PSE&G invested approximately $2.2 billion in 2014 on capital projects that improve the system's resilience and maintain its reliability. We currently forecast an increase in PSE&G's average capital spending for the next 3 years to about $2.4 billion per year. PSE&G's investment in Transmission will represent more than 50% of this new spending. We will be providing you with an updated forecast of PSE&G's capital expenditures by year for the 5-year period ending 2019 at our annual financial conference on March 2 of this year, and I can tell you, that spending plan remains robust.
Now let's turn to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $642 million, or $1.27 per share, compared to 2013's operating earnings of $710 million, or $1.40 per share. The earnings release, as well as Slides 11 and 13, provide you with detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and costs. We've also provided you with more detail on generation in the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. Power's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were influence by the known decline in capacity revenues that we've discussed in prior calls, the monetization of Power's gas supply position and a reduction in operating and maintenance expense helped mitigate the effects of lower market prices for energy. As you recall, the average price for our PJM capacity declined to $166 per megawatt day from $244 per megawatt day on June 1 of 2014. The decline in price reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. A decline in the average hedge price for energy that Power realized during the quarter relative to year ago levels and lower market prices on Power's open position were more than offset by Power's ability to monetize its gas supply position. These items together led to an improvement in quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. A decline in Power's O&M expenditures during the quarter improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share. And the decline in expense for the quarter was greater than what we have been forecasting at the end of the third quarter. Power's management of maintenance outages at its fossil stations, coupled with the absence of outage-related expenditures in the prior year, resulted in a better than forecast reduction in O&M expense for the fourth year -- for the fourth quarter and led overall to lower O&M expense in 2014 versus the full year of 2013.
Now let's turn to the operations. Power's output increased 3.1% in the quarter from year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 1.3% to 54.2 terawatt hours. The fleet's flexibility and response to volatile market conditions was demonstrated in the quarter and throughout the year. The level of production achieved by the fleet in 2014 represented the third-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator. The nuclear fleet produced 29.1 terawatt hours, or 54% of generation, operating at an average capacity factor of 89.3%. Hope Creek experienced its second best year, operating at a 97.9 annual capacity factor, which helped to offset the impact of the extended refueling outage at Salem 2 earlier in 2014. The market is clearly rewarding efficient combined cycle gas units and Power's combined cycle fleet set a generation record during the year. The fleet produced 16.5 terawatt hours, or 30% of our generation during the year, with record levels of output from the Bergen station and Linden unit 1. The coal fleet produced 7.4 terawatt hours, or 14% of generation, and the peaking fleet's responsiveness to market conditions, particularly the abnormally cold weather experienced at the start of 2014, led to full year production of 1.2 terawatt hours.
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower priced gas supplies in the Marcellus basin. For the year, gas from the Marcellus-Utica region supplied approximately 60% of the PJM asset's fuel requirements. This represent a larger percentage of the fleet's gas supply than was available in the past. Power's ability to step up its acquisition of gas from the Western Marcellus and Utica basin, in addition to the use of backhaul arrangements on existing pipe in the Eastern Marcellus, improved its access to this low-cost resource. This supply supports higher spark spreads and implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings similar to the levels it enjoyed in 2013 despite the decline in energy prices.
Overall, Power's gross margin per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter was $37.40 versus $45.90 last year, which was driven by the capacity price reset. For the year, gross margin amounted to $42.41 per megawatt hour versus $47.10 per megawatt hour last year, and Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margin for the quarter and the year. Power's forecasting a further improvement in output in 2015 to 55 to 57 terawatt hours. The increase is primarily the result of investments we have made to expand the capacity of our Nuclear and Combined Cycle fleet. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has hedged 100% of its baseload generation in 2015 and has hedged approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated total production for 2015 at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour, which compares favorably to the average hedge prices in 2014 of $48 per megawatt hour. Power had hedged approximately 50% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2016, estimated at 55 to 57 terawatt hours, also at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and '16 assumes BGS volumes represent approximately 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries, about comparable to the 11.5 we delivered in 2014 under BGS.
Based on our current hedge position for 2015, each $2 change in spark spreads would impact earnings by only $0.04 per share. This modest impact on earnings is a result of a higher percentage of output from our intermediate and peaking fleet that is hedged at this time about 40% to 45% than we had hedged a year ago when it was really about 35% to 40% of forecasted output for the intermediate and peaking fleet. For 2016, a $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by $0.06 per share. And just for your reference, if we were fully open, the $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by about $0.24 per share.
The BGS auction for PSE&G customers for the 3-year period beginning June 1 of 2015 and ending on May 31, 2018, was priced at $99.54 per megawatt hour. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the contract for $83.88 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31 of this year. This latest auction is based on an average price for energy at the PJM-West hub of about $37 to $38 per megawatt hour, which is similar to the base price for energy seen in the last 2 auctions. The BGS auction continues to represent a key means for Power to hedge basis associated with baseload output.
Power's hedging strategy is consistent with what you've seen in the past. Power maintains open positions on a portion of its intermediate and load-following assets, and this allows Power to capture any benefits associated with weather-related demand in the summer months and contain the risks associated with Full Requirements Contracts like BGS'. Power took advantage of market strength earlier in 2014 to hedge its output. And given favorable pricing, Power is also committed to serve a larger percentage of load under the BGS contract in this latest auction, which of course will have its proportional impact across the upcoming 3 years.
Power's operating earnings for 2015 are forecast at $620 million to $680 million. We're very pleased that our anticipated results are essentially in line with 2014's operating results. Comparative results for the full year will be affected by a decline in capacity revenues, which will essentially be fully offset by an increase in the average price received on energy hedges and a modest increase in O&M.
Turning to Enterprise and Other. PSEG Enterprise Other reported an operating earnings loss for the fourth quarter of $4 million, or about $0.01 per share, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $11 million, or $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. The results of the fourth quarter brought full year 2014 operating earnings to $33 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with 2013's operating loss of $13 million, or $0.03 per share. The difference in operating results quarter-over-quarter reflects primarily the options of tax payment and other items which contributed $0.03 per share relative to the fourth quarter of 2013.
For 2015, operating earnings are forecasted to fall within the range of $40 million to $45 million, and results will be influenced by the contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island, income on the lease portfolio, including the benefit from the renegotiation and extension of our lease on the Grand Gulf nuclear generating facility.
Let me now just add a word about pension expense. Last year as you recall, we saw total pension income of about $0.02 per share as the success of our investment strategy created that pension income. In 2015, our funding level remains greater than 90%, but a lower discount rate and changes to mortality tables offset the continued strong return we generated on the trust, resulting in net pension expense of slightly less than $0.07 per share, which is split about evenly between PSE&G and Power. Keep in mind, these are noncash charges, and we anticipate to move back to pension income over the next 2 to 3-year period, given our solid funding and our long-term investment strategy. These impacts that I just mentioned are embedded in our financial plan and our guidance for growth at PSE&G and consistent performance in 2015 at Power. We still see a low-single digit growth in O&M across the company over the 3-year horizon, and we'll talk more about that in greater detail on March 2.
Lastly, just a word on our financial position. We're in great shape to finance our capital program. At the end of 2014, we had $402 million of cash on hand, and debt represented about 42% of our consolidated capital position with debted Power approximating 31% of its capital base and no parent debt. We'll be updating you on our capital program at our annual financial conference, but the message is the same. We can finance our robust long-term capital program and pursue a very healthy amount of growth opportunities without the need to issue equity, as we also provide our shareholders with a meaningful increase in the growth of the common dividend on a sustainable basis. We're pleased to be guiding to another year of anticipated growth in earnings for 2015 of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. Our forecast continues to reflect the benefits from PSE&G's expanded capital program and the dynamics of Power's fleet and access to low-cost gas supplies.
As you know, the common dividend was recently increased to 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share, and we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward.
With that, Randy, I'll turn it back to you, and we're now ready for your questions."

As you all know, we've been much more successful on the latter and not as successful on the former. So Peach Bottom upgrade and advanced gas path improvements, a couple of peakers here and there. I have not been able to see the same price justification as others on asset acquisitions and a similar thing happened in New England. In general, we like the New England market from the point of view of newbuild because of the 7-year. That's a bigger hurdle to overcome in PJM because of the 1 year price. On the regular utility side, we'll give you more detail on March 2, but they're still very much a robust capital program that we'll be showing you for the 5 years. Not just in terms of Transmission, which has been our #1, but as we've talked about in the past, opportunities to accelerate the replacement of our [indiscernible] main system in the gas business, as well as some of the components of the Energy Master Plan that relate to energy efficiencies and renewables. You may recall, it's only been 10 months or so, so I'm not suggesting we're done by any means, but Energy Strong was a much bigger program than what was ultimately approved. So there'll be more of that. But that's a little bit longer term than in the next coming months. So there's no shortage of opportunities to deploying capital. We are disappointed about Bridgeport Harbor, I'm not going to deny that. But we've got things we can do."

The winter is where most of the volatility and earnings potential for Power is coming from. And that hasn't changed since we started talking about that now, almost 2 seasons ago. So when you look at basis for the year, that's a little bit of a misleading view of the world. It's a combination of modern basis in the summer, very strong basis in the winter and weak basis, in fact, negative basis in the shoulder periods. But the flexibility of our fleet and the way in which we hedge it takes all of that into account. Over the longer term, I think what you're going to see is the market dynamic that's going to be driven by significant infrastructure build of gas pipes from the Marcellus region to the Southeast and significant replacement of aging power plants that are unable to meet environmental standards in the Southeast with highly efficient natural gas combined cycles. So we're up -- we don't run the business saying that we're smarter than the market, but to the extent that the market's view doesn't extend to that 3 to 5-year timeframe, we still have lots of reason to feel pretty confident in the location and quality of our asset base."

Now of course, a piece of that would be BGS, but if you do the math on that, you'd see that's a little less than half of the total on an estimated basis. And really what's going on, Dan, and if you look at the curves, just look at the forward price curves, you can see this: there were opportunities where the prices moved up during the last quarter before they came down right at the very end, and spark spreads have been pretty robust. And so we took advantage of those opportunities to layer on incremental hedges. And by having that incremental flexibility and putting on a little bit more and capturing those price in sparks for opportunities, that's what's really increased the numbers. Now if you're asking about the change in the price of base load, you know that we actually get one consistent price across. So even though base load was 100%, the average price of the entirety of the book, we put that across all the hedges. But we give you the granularity of where we're hedged between base load and intermediate and peaking. So we like the impact that we had in the fourth quarter by adding on hedges.

But it should regrow at a faster rate coming out of the blocks, '15 going forward based on the CapEx and things which you have indicated. Am I on the right track?"

I won't validate a particular number that you cited there, but yes. Think about onetime effects, right? When you have a year-on-year effect of something like bonus depreciation, which you remember was past at the very, very end of 2014 -- that has its one-year effect and then it becomes part of the base. Pension, same thing, right? Lower interest rate and that mortality table, which as you probably know, was a once in about 10-year effect -- those things come in. And so we would expect utility growth to be higher as we go into -- on a '15 to '16 basis than on a '14 to '15, for exactly the reasons you cite. Overlaid on the backdrop of what I just mentioned, which is a continued robust investment program averaging a little bit more on an annual basis than we actually spent last year. So the fundamentals are there to provide the driver for that opportunity, and we've got these sort of one-year effects from the 2 items. That's the right way to think about it."

If you look at forward curves, you still see that differential and so that's valuable and we model everything on the forward curve, including thinking about that differential. But of course, you can always think about for us that does sustain is that access, right? So we have the access this year, given what the team has been able to accomplish in terms of providing even more access to Leidy, Marcellus and Utica gas. We've been able to step up that percentage to a total of about 60%. And so when you have the differential and we've got this long-term access, that's going to stay with us.

I mean, temperatures have been averaging about 16 degrees below average in the last few days, and plants are operating. But I think, I know for us and I suspect for others, there were some operational changes we were able to make, to reduce the amount of forced outages. Just in light of the forecast, we moved our coal piles around a little bit more so that we made sure that we don't face them freezing up. But what hasn't changed for us or -- and I suspect for others, the amount of capital investment that's being made in the older units which basically never run until you get 6 days averaging 16 degrees below 0. And I think FERC is very cognizant of that. So there's only so much you can get out of improved performance by doing some operational prep work, and eventually the frictional forces that these temperatures overcome whatever you might do in terms of preparation and those capital improvements are needed. And so I think FERC will be supportive. I don't want to predict any outcome. I don't want to guarantee an outcome. But suffice to say that there's really 2 issues that are evolving. Making sure power plant will run. It's what you physically have put into the asset and what you do to ready it. And in terms of physical preparation, it is not leaving coal piles exposed, putting buildings around them so that they're protected from the elements. That's a capital investment, and you're not going to do that unless you know that you're going to get paid in the capacity market because those typically, in our case, at least [indiscernible] capture energy margin. So we're still cautiously optimistic about what FERC will do, and we are very confident that whatever FERC does, we'd give the type of fleet that will benefit from it."

So that work is probably going to be the longest dated one, and when we do file for additional help in that area, that's likely to not be offered at least another year. Another big part of Energy Strong, though, was a $350 million program to replace some of the [indiscernible] fired main system and I think we've got over 200 miles of that already. And that is one that is scheduled to pretty much wind down by the end of '15. So we'll talk more in detail about that on March 2, but that is filing that we will be making in very, very short order to continue that program. That's important for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is number one, you don't want to keep mobilizing and then demobilizing a workforce to do that. And as I said, that's winding down at the end of the year. And probably equally, if not more important, is the fact that we've continued to be able to pass these gas credits onto our customers. So this is the time to make the investment in infrastructure while the supply part of the bill is actually coming down. Because it's something that the customer can afford to do right now. We're always mindful of the burden that we're putting on the customers. But there's some other parts of Energy Strong that are smaller in magnitude, but those being the 2 biggest ones. Some of the other things we've talked about in terms of potential investments that we're still waiting to hear on are the utility 2.0 program out on Long Island. Candidly, we thought that will be resolved by now, but that looks like it's going to go out a couple of more quarters into this year. We had thought we were the winner of the FERC 1000 project Artificial [ph] Island. As you know, PJM is reconsidering that and I don't know exactly when the decision will be forthcoming there. We thought it would be Q1, but Q1 is now halfway gone and that decision isn't done. The PennEast Pipeline investment we've made is still underway. The energy efficiency filing that we made is still having very constructive dialogue with the staff on that. So there are things in all manner, all different stages, from a disappointment in terms of Bridgeport Harbor, optimism in terms of energy efficiency and a whole bunch of stuff in between."

So something just a little bit out of character. As many of you know -- as all of you know, there's probably no bigger fan of our employees than yours truly here. There is one that I just want to make special mention of the -- many of you probably have never met before. But after 40 years of service to the industry and 10 years with us, 8 years as our Chief Nuclear Officer, we did announce the retirement of Tom Joyce. Tom is just the quintessential professional. Not only did he just create tremendous value for our customers and our shareholders, but he did what's expected of every strong leader, and that as he leaves behind an incredibly solid team and groom the talents of the successor. But I just can't thank Tom enough. And I thanked him yesterday in front of the employees. So I want to make sure I thank him today in front of our investors.
As to the rest of my comments, it's simply this: For those of you in the Northeast, I hope you stay warm. Hang in there, our plants are running, I guess. Pressures on the system are good, if not only even Northeast but you're in our service territory, and I hope to see all of you a week from Monday at our annual meetings. So I hope you're as pleased as we are with our results, and the outlook for '15 looks even stronger. See you soon. Thank you."

I'm pleased to report, actually I'm more than pleased to report, that 2014 was the year which we continued to make progress",1080,"Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2014. I'm pleased to report, actually I'm more than pleased to report, that 2014 was the year which we continued to make progress on our plans to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.49 per share which equaled the $0.49 per share earned in 2013's fourth quarter, bringing results for the full year to $2.76 per share, or 7% greater than 2013's operating earnings of $2.58 per share. And it was above our guidance of $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Our results are benefiting from disciplined capital allocation. PSE&G, our utility, achieved double-digit growth in earnings, adding to our track record of 5 years of 18% compound annual growth. As a result of an expended capital program, earnings from our regulator company grew to represent 52% of our consolidated operating earnings as PSE&G's investment in transmission has grown to represent 39% of its $11.4 billion rate base. PSEG Power successful management of its operations, including its gas supply arrangements, supported earnings in excess of guidance for the full year and delivered substantial savings to PSE&G's customers.
In addition to being a successful year for delivering on earnings, we achieved success in many areas that will provide a lasting foundation for customer satisfaction and shareholder value. By way of a reminder, we received approval to invest $1.2 billion in Energy Strong, a program that will improve the resiliency of our electric and gas distribution systems. We have begun the work on replacing and modernizing 250 miles of gas pipe and have begun the engineering and scheduling associated with upgrading and enhancing our electric substations. The investments under the Energy Strong Program, as you will recall, will take place over a period of 3 years to 5 years. We're also executing well on our Transmission investment program. We completed construction of 2 230 kilovolt transmission lines during the year, as well as the New Jersey portion of the 500 kV Susquehanna Roseland line. We expect the full Susquehanna Roseland line to go into service this year when the Pennsylvania portion of SR is completed. The investment in Transmission will support the reliable service our customers have come to expect and provide an important boost to New Jersey's economy as it also adds to PSE&G's growth. PSE&G once again was named the mid-Atlantic region's most reliable electric utility. This is the 13th consecutive year that PSE&G's capabilities have been recognized. In addition to that, for the first time in its history, PSE&G received J.D. Power's award for highest customer satisfaction for both electric and gas business service among large utilities in the region. This recognition, while important in itself, we think recognizes that PSE&G has always kept the needs of its customers uppermost as we pursue our major growth initiatives.
But 2014 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced at record levels as Powers' fossil fleet achieved the safety performance in the top 10% of the industry. We successfully grew PSEG Solar Source's portfolio. In 2014, we added projects in 3 states that expanded Solar Source's portfolio to 123 megawatts of clean renewable energy. And we had a successful first year of operating the electric system of the Long Island Power Authority. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts of our PSEG Long Island team who were awarded with a major improvement in customer satisfaction scores. But let me be clear, this is only the beginning of a multiyear journey for us on Long Island.
Our core strategy, focused on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, is anticipated to yield a third year of growth in operating earnings over the coming year. For 2015, we are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission is expected to support continued growth in operating earnings in '15, as PSE&G's results for the full year are expected to represent more than 50% of consolidated earnings. PSEG Power is expected to report operating earnings in line with its strong 2014 results. The investments made by PSEG Power are expected to enhance the competitiveness of its environmentally well-positioned fleet. Capacity upgrades at our gas-fired combined cycle fleet and in our nuclear units will increase the fleet's output as Power's investment in the PennEast Pipeline enhances its already strong actions to low-cost gas for the Marcellus region. PSEG Power's fleet has the characteristics envisioned by PJM's proposed standards for capacity performance. Its diversity and dispatch and fuel mix, as well as the alternate fuel capability, mitigates operating risk. Power's investment program will be focused on improving its reliability during periods of stress on the system. We also look to expand the fleet when it's financially attractive. We were disappointed that our bid to construct a new 475-megawatt combined cycle plant at our Bridgeport Harbor site in Connecticut didn't clear the New England [indiscernible] recent capacity auction. However, we haven't abandoned this work, and we'll invest when the markets support its development.
The strategy we implemented has yielded growth. We have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that will support further expansion of our capital program over the next 5 years. The program is expected to yield double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base as we maintain the operating strength of Power's generating assets. We will update you on our capital spending plans on March 2. Our financial position remains strong, and acknowledgment of our success and the strength of our platform going forward was the recent decision by our Board of Directors to meaningfully increase the common dividend by 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend given our business mix. Our continued positive cash flow from our generation business and our strong financial position all support this dividend philosophy. We've made significant strides in meeting our objectives for growth as we also satisfy customer requirements, and we're not done. Of course, none of this would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated employees to our continued success.
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you in our March 2 annual financial conference.
I will now turn the call over to Caroline for more details on our results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after her remarks."
298482,282460080,767575,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2015",2015-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter bro",3004,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.76 per share versus operating earnings for 2013 of $2.58 per share, or 7% growth.
On Slide 4, we have provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. And as you can see on Slide 10, PSE&G provided the largest contribution to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share last year. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share last year. Enterprise Other reported a small loss in operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.01 per share versus the operating loss of $0.03 per share reported in the fourth quarter of '13. We've provided you with waterfall charts on Slides 11 and 13 to take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings by major business.
So now I'll review each company in a bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. As I mentioned, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $0.32 per share compared with $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 as we show on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2014 operating earnings were $725 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with operating earnings of $612 million, or $1.21 per share for 2013, for growth of 18%. PSE&G's earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from lower operating expenses, including pensions, and a return on its expanded capital infrastructure program, which more than offset the impact of mild weather on sales.
PSE&G's investment in Transmission infrastructure increased its quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. The earnings improvement related to the investment in Transmission in the fourth quarter was less than the earnings increases you've seen during each of the first 3 quarters of the year, and this reflects a reduction in PSE&G's rate base at year-end associated with the deferred tax impact of the expansion of bonus depreciation. PSE&G's tight control of its operating expenses, including lower pension expense, resulted in a quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings of $0.04 per share. The continued improvement in weather-normalized gas volume and demand, which improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, was offset by a similar decline in electric volume and demand. And although you wouldn't think it on a day like today, weather was actually mild relative to normal and relative to the prior year, and that reduced earnings comparisons by about $0.01 per share. Earnings comparisons were also affected by the absence of $0.02 per share to tax-related change, which benefited earnings in the prior year.
Economic conditions continued to exhibit signs of an improvement in the service area which is good news. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 1% in the quarter and 3.1% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from a decline in the cost of gas, which is passed on to our residential customers, and an improvement in economic growth.
PSE&G announced earlier this month that it would extend through March of 2015 the credits against gas bills that it had already provided to residential customers for the months of November, December and January. A typical residential customer with these credits would experience savings on their total bill over the 5 months of approximately 31%, or $210.
Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have declined 2.3% in the fourth quarter. The decline in the quarter reflects a number of winter storms at the end of 2013 that increased residential consumption in that year, as well as decreases in demand this quarter from some large industrial customers. By the way, weather normalization is generally good for temperature, but unfortunately, there's not really a good way to adjust for storms. Overall, there was a 0.3% increase in weather-normalized electric demand for the year, which we think is indicative of improving economic conditions, partially offset by continued customer conservation.
PSE&G implemented an increase in Transmission revenue of $182 million effective on January 1 of this year. The increase in revenue under PSE&G's Transmission formula rate will provide PSE&G with recovery of and a return on its forecast of Transmission-related capital expenditures through the year. PSE&G's investment in Transmission grew to $4.5 billion at the end of 2014, or 39% of the company's consolidated rate base of $11.4 billion, and Transmission is forecast to be well over 40% of rate base as we go forward.
Let me just mention the impact of bonus depreciation. Expansion of bonus depreciation has the effect of reducing PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base with an increase in deferred taxes. We estimate PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base was reduced by approximately $150 million to $200 million from prior forecast levels, and this is reflected in PSE&G's year-end rate base of $11.4 billion. The impact of this change on 2015 revenues is not reflected in the formula rate increase that I just went through as that filing took place prior to the enactment of the extension of bonus depreciation. But our guidance for PSE&G reflects the impact on revenue associated with the extension of bonus depreciation, and we estimate that impact to be approximately $21 million. As you know, this is really a timing-related issue. We get the benefit of an increase in cash over the short term and see a decrease in the deferred tax balance over the long term.
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 are forecasted to grow to $735 million to $775 million. Our forecast for 2015 reflects the continued growth in PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base and the expansion of PSE&G's investment in distribution through the Energy Strong Program. Earnings for the full year will also be affected by a forecast increase in pension expense that will affect O&M, and I'll go into a little more detail on that shortly. We expect PSE&G's rate of earnings growth to improve beyond 2015 as the impact of bonus depreciation will annualize, and pension expense is expected to be lower under long-term return and interest rate assumptions.
PSE&G invested approximately $2.2 billion in 2014 on capital projects that improve the system's resilience and maintain its reliability. We currently forecast an increase in PSE&G's average capital spending for the next 3 years to about $2.4 billion per year. PSE&G's investment in Transmission will represent more than 50% of this new spending. We will be providing you with an updated forecast of PSE&G's capital expenditures by year for the 5-year period ending 2019 at our annual financial conference on March 2 of this year, and I can tell you, that spending plan remains robust.
Now let's turn to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share 1 year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $642 million, or $1.27 per share, compared to 2013's operating earnings of $710 million, or $1.40 per share. The earnings release, as well as Slides 11 and 13, provide you with detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and costs. We've also provided you with more detail on generation in the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. Power's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were influenced by the known decline in capacity revenues that we've discussed in prior calls, the monetization of Power's gas supply position and a reduction in operating and maintenance expense helped mitigate the effects of lower market prices for energy. As you recall, the average price for our PJM capacity declined to $166 per megawatt day from $244 per megawatt day on June 1 of 2014. The decline in price reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. A decline in the average hedge price for energy that Power realized during the quarter relative to year ago levels and lower market prices on Power's open position were more than offset by Power's ability to monetize its gas supply position. These items together led to an improvement in quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. A decline in Power's O&M expenditures during the quarter improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share. And the decline in expense for the quarter was greater than what we had been forecasting at the end of the third quarter. Power's management of maintenance outages at its fossil stations, coupled with the absence of outage-related expenditures in the prior year, resulted in a better than forecast reduction in O&M expense for the fourth year -- for the fourth quarter and led overall to lower O&M expense in 2014 versus the full year of 2013.
Now let's turn to the operations. Power's output increased 3.1% in the quarter from year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 1.3% to 54.2 terawatt hours. The fleet's flexibility and response to volatile market conditions was demonstrated in the quarter and throughout the year. The level of production achieved by the fleet in 2014 represented the third-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator. The nuclear fleet produced 29.1 terawatt hours, or 54% of generation, operating at an average capacity factor of 89.3%. Hope Creek experienced its second best year, operating at a 97.9 annual capacity factor, which helped to offset the impact of the extended refueling outage at Salem 2 earlier in 2014. The market is clearly rewarding efficient combined cycle gas units and Power's combined cycle fleet set a generation record during the year. The fleet produced 16.5 terawatt hours, or 30% of our generation during the year, with record levels of output from the Bergen station and Linden Unit 1. The coal fleet produced 7.4 terawatt hours, or 14% of generation, and the peaking fleet's responsiveness to market conditions, particularly the abnormally cold weather experienced at the start of 2014, led to full year production of 1.2 terawatt hours.
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower priced gas supplies in the Marcellus basin. For the year, gas from the Marcellus-Utica region supplied approximately 60% of the PJM asset's fuel requirements. This represents a larger percentage of the fleet's gas supply than was available in the past. Power's ability to step up its acquisition of gas from the Western Marcellus and Utica basin, in addition to the use of backhaul [ph] arrangements on existing pipe in the Eastern Marcellus, improved its access to this low-cost resource. This supply supports higher spark spreads that implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings similar to the levels it enjoyed in 2013 despite the decline in energy prices.
Overall, Power's gross margin per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter was $37.40 versus $45.90 last year, which was driven by the capacity price reset. For the year, gross margin amounted to $42.41 per megawatt hour versus $47.10 per megawatt hour last year, and Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margin for the quarter and the year. Power's forecasting a further improvement in output in 2015 to 55 to 57 terawatt hours. The increase is primarily the result of investments we have made to expand the capacity of our Nuclear and Combined Cycle fleet. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has hedged 100% of its baseload generation in 2015 and has hedged approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated total production for 2015 at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour, which compares favorably to the average hedge prices in 2014 of $48 per megawatt hour. Power had hedged approximately 50% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2016, estimated at 55 to 57 terawatt hours, also at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and '16 assumes BGS volumes represent approximately 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries, about comparable to the 11.5 terawatt hours we delivered in 2014 under BGS.
Based on our current hedge position for 2015, each $2 change in spark spreads would impact earnings by only $0.04 per share. This modest impact on earnings is a result of a higher percentage of output from our intermediate and peaking fleet that is hedged at this time about 40% to 45% than we had hedged a year ago when it was really about 35% to 40% of forecasted output for the intermediate and peaking fleet. For 2016, a $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by $0.06 per share. And just for your reference, if we were fully open, the $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by about $0.24 per share.
The BGS auction for PSE&G customers for the 3-year period beginning June 1 of 2015 and ending on May 31, 2018, was priced at $99.54 per megawatt hour. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the contract for $83.88 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31 of this year. This latest auction is based on an average price for energy at the PJM-West hub of about $37 to $38 per megawatt hour, which is similar to the base price for energy seen in the last 2 auctions. The BGS auction continues to represent a key means for Power to hedge basis associated with baseload output.
Power's hedging strategy is consistent with what you've seen in the past. Power maintains open positions on a portion of its intermediate and load-following assets, and this allows Power to capture any benefits associated with weather-related demand in the summer months and contain the risks associated with Full Requirements Contracts like BGS'. Power took advantage of market strength earlier in 2014 to hedge its output. And given favorable pricing, Power is also committed to serve a larger percentage of load under the BGS contract in this latest auction, which of course will have its proportional impact across the upcoming 3 years.
Power's operating earnings for 2015 are forecast at $620 million to $680 million. We're very pleased that our anticipated results are essentially in line with 2014's operating results. Comparative results for the full year will be affected by a decline in capacity revenues, which will essentially be fully offset by an increase in the average price received on energy hedges and a modest increase in O&M.
Turning to Enterprise and Other. PSEG Enterprise Other reported an operating earnings loss for the fourth quarter of $4 million, or about $0.01 per share, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $11 million, or $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. The results of the fourth quarter brought full year 2014 operating earnings to $33 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with 2013's operating loss of $13 million, or $0.03 per share. The difference in operating results quarter-over-quarter reflects primarily the absence of tax payments and other items which contributed $0.03 per share relative to the fourth quarter of 2013.
For 2015, operating earnings are forecasted to fall within the range of $40 million to $45 million, and results will be influenced by the contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island, income on the lease portfolio, including the benefit from the renegotiation and extension of our lease on the Grand Gulf nuclear generating facility.
Let me now just add a word about pension expense. Last year as you recall, we saw total pension income of about $0.02 per share as the success of our investment strategy created that pension income. In 2015, our funding level remains greater than 90%, but a lower discount rate and changes to mortality tables offset the continued strong return we generated on the trust, resulting in net pension expense of slightly less than $0.07 per share, which is split about evenly between PSE&G and Power. Keep in mind, these are noncash charges, and we anticipate a move back to pension income over the next 2 to 3-year period, given our solid funding and our long-term investment strategy. These impacts that I just mentioned are embedded in our financial plan and our guidance for growth at PSE&G and consistent performance in 2015 at Power. We still see a low-single digit growth in O&M across the company over the 3-year horizon, and we'll talk more about that in greater detail on March 2.
Lastly, just a word on our financial position. We're in great shape to finance our capital program. At the end of 2014, we had $402 million of cash on hand, and debt represented about 42% of our consolidated capital position with debted Power approximating 31% of its capital base and no parent debt. We'll be updating you on our capital program at our annual financial conference, but the message is the same. We can finance our robust long-term capital program and pursue a very healthy amount of growth opportunities without the need to issue equity, as we also provide our shareholders with a meaningful increase in the growth of the common dividend on a sustainable basis. We're pleased to be guiding to another year of anticipated growth in earnings for 2015 of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. Our forecast continues to reflect the benefits from PSE&G's expanded capital program and the dynamics of Power's fleet and access to low-cost gas supplies.
As you know, the common dividend was recently increased 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share, and we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward.
With that, Brandy, I'll turn it back to you, and we're now ready for your questions."

Our power markets that we're interested in are PJM, New York and New England. We look for asset acquisitions, we look for opportunities to repower sites, we look for opportunities to expand or increase the output of our plants. As you all know, we've been much more successful on the latter and not as successful on the former. So Peach Bottom upgrade and advanced gas path improvements, a couple of peakers [ph] here and there. I have not been able to see the same price justification as others on asset acquisitions and a similar thing happened in New England. In general, we like the New England market from the point of view of newbuild because of the 7-year. That's a bigger hurdle to overcome in PJM because of the 1 year price. On the regular utility side, we'll give you more detail on March 2, but they're still very much a robust capital program that we'll be showing you for the 5 years. Not just in terms of Transmission, which has been our #1, but as we've talked about in the past, opportunities to accelerate the replacement of our cast iron main system in the gas business, as well as some of the components of the Energy Master Plan that relate to energy efficiencies and renewables. You may recall, it's only been 10 months or so, so I'm not suggesting we're done by any means, but Energy Strong was a much bigger program than what was ultimately approved. So there'll be more of that. But that's a little bit longer term than in the next coming months. So there's no shortage of opportunities to deploy the capital. We are disappointed about Bridgeport Harbor, I'm not going to deny that. But we've got things we can do."

The winter is where most of the volatility and earnings potential for Power is coming from. And that hasn't changed since we started talking about that now, almost 2 seasons ago. So when you look at basis for the year, that's a little bit of a misleading view of the world. It's a combination of modern basis in the summer, very strong basis in the winter and weak basis, in fact, negative basis in the shoulder periods. But the flexibility of our fleet and the way in which we hedge it takes all of that into account. Over the longer term, I think what you're going to see is the market dynamic that's going to be driven by significant infrastructure build of gas pipes from the Marcellus region to the Southeast and significant replacement of aging power plants that are unable to meet environmental standards in the Southeast with highly efficient natural gas combined cycles. So we're -- we don't run the business saying that we're smarter than the market, but to the extent that the market's view doesn't extend to that 3 to 5-year timeframe, we still have lots of reason to feel pretty confident in the location and quality of our asset base."

Yes, I cited the base load and the total, and keep in mind, that intermediate and peaking, right? So if you look at what we told you on the third quarter call, we were still 100% hedged at the base load, but the differences really occurred as we've added hedges in that intermediate and peaking which was 5% to 10% for 2015 on the last call and is now 40% to 45%. Now of course, a piece of that would be BGS, but if you do the math on that, you'd see that's a little less than 1/2 of the total on an estimated basis. And really what's going on, Dan, and if you look at the curves, just look at the forward price curves, you can see this: there were opportunities where the prices moved up during the last quarter before they came down right at the very end, and spark spreads have been pretty robust. And so we took advantage of those opportunities to layer on incremental hedges. And by having that incremental flexibility and putting on a little bit more and capturing those price in sparks for opportunities, that's what's really increased the numbers. Now, if you're asking about the change in the price of base load, you know that we actually give 1 consistent price across. So even though base load was 100%, the average price of the entirety of the book, we put that across all the hedges. But we give you the granularity of where we're hedged between base load and intermediate and peaking. So we like the impact that we had in the fourth quarter by adding on hedges. You know that BGS, of course being Full Requirements also has some passthrough costs, but even if you strip that out, you'd find that the hedges are really higher than they were from our last report."

And so I think FERC will be supportive. I don't want to predict any outcome. I don't want to guarantee an outcome. But suffice to say that there's really 2 issues that are involving making sure power plant will run: it's what you physically have put into the asset and what you do to ready it. And in terms of physical preparation, it is not leaving coal piles exposed, putting buildings around them so that they're protected from the elements. That's a capital investment, and you're not going to do that unless you know that you're going to get paid in the capacity market because those typically, in our case at least, aren't units that capture energy margin. So we're still cautiously optimistic about what FERC will do, and we are very confident that whatever FERC does, we'd give [ph] the type of fleet that will benefit from it."

There were a series of substations, for example, that were a centerpiece of it -- I think there were 29 of them that have to be upgraded. And there what we are is we're in the engineering and design phase of that work. So that work is probably going to be the longest dated one, and when we do file for additional help in that area, that's likely to not be offered at least another year. Another big part of Energy Strong, though, was a $350 million program to replace some of the cast iron main system and I think we've done over 200 miles of that already. And that is one that is scheduled to pretty much wind down by the end of '15. So we'll talk more in detail about that on March 2, but that is a filing that we will be making in very, very short order to continue that program. That's important for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is, number one, you don't want to keep mobilizing and then demobilizing a workforce to do that. And as I said, that's winding down at the end of the year. And probably equally, if not more important, is the fact that we've continued to be able to pass these gas credits onto our customers. So this is the time to make the investment in infrastructure while the supply part of the bill is actually coming down. Because it's something that the customer can afford to do right now. We're always mindful of the burden that we're putting on the customers. But there's some other parts of Energy Strong that are smaller in magnitude, but those being the 2 biggest ones. Some of the other things we've talked about in terms of potential investments that we're still waiting to hear on are the utility 2.0 program out on Long Island. Candidly, we thought that will be resolved by now, but that looks like it's going to go out a couple of more quarters into this year. We had thought we were the winner of the FERC 1000 project, the Artificial [ph] Island. As you know, PJM is reconsidering that and I don't know exactly when the decision will be forthcoming there. We thought it would be Q1, but Q1 is now halfway gone and that decision isn't done. The PennEast Pipeline investment we've made is still underway. The energy efficiency filing that we made is still having very constructive dialogue with the staff on that. So there are things in all manner, all different stages, from disappointment in terms of Bridgeport Harbor, optimism in terms of energy efficiency and a whole bunch of stuff in between."

As you are aware, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings results earlier this morning. The release and attachments, as mentioned, are posted on our website, www.pseg.com, under the Investors section. We have also posted a series of slides that detail operating results by company for the quarter. Our 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, is expected to be filed shortly. I don't typically read the full disclaimer statement or the comments we have on the difference between operating earnings and GAAP results, but I do ask that you read those comments contained in our slides and on our website. The disclaimer regards forward-looking statements detailing the number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made therein. And although we may elect to update forward-looking statements from time to time, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even as our estimates change unless, of course, we are required to do so by applicable securities laws. We also provide commentary with regard to the difference between operating earnings and net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We believe -- PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of operating earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance to help shareholders understand trends.

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2014. I'm pleased to report, actually I'm more than pleased to report, that 2014 was the year which we continued to make progress on our plans to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.49 per share which equaled the $0.49 per share earned in 2013's fourth quarter, bringing results for the full year to $2.76 per share, or 7% greater than 2013's operating earnings of $2.58 per share. And it was above our guidance of $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Our results are benefiting from disciplined capital allocation. PSE&G, our utility, achieved double-digit growth in earnings, adding to our track record of 5 years of 18% compound annual growth. As a result of an expended capital program, earnings from our regulator company grew to represent 52% of our consolidated operating earnings as PSE&G's investment in transmission has grown to represent 39% of its $11.4 billion rate base. PSEG Power successful management of its operations, including its gas supply arrangements, supported earnings in excess of guidance for the full year and delivered substantial savings to PSE&G's customers.
In addition to being a successful year for delivering on earnings, we achieved success in many areas that will provide a lasting foundation for customer satisfaction and shareholder value. By way of a reminder, we received approval to invest $1.2 billion in Energy Strong, a program that will improve the resiliency of our electric and gas distribution systems. We have begun the work on replacing and modernizing 250 miles of gas pipe and have begun the engineering and scheduling associated with upgrading and enhancing our electric substations. The investments under the Energy Strong Program, as you will recall, will take place over a period of 3 to 5 years. We're also executing well on our Transmission investment program. We completed construction of 2 230 kilovolt transmission lines during the year, as well as the New Jersey portion of the 500 kV Susquehanna Roseland line. We expect the full Susquehanna Roseland line to go into service this year when the Pennsylvania portion of SR is completed. The investment in Transmission will support the reliable service our customers have come to expect and provide an important boost to New Jersey's economy as it also adds to PSE&G's growth. PSE&G once again was named the mid-Atlantic region's most reliable electric utility. This is the 13th consecutive year that PSE&G's capabilities have been recognized. In addition to that, for the first time in its history, PSE&G received J.D. Power's award for highest customer satisfaction for both electric and gas business service among large utilities in the region. This recognition, while important in itself, we think recognizes that PSE&G has always kept the needs of its customers uppermost as we pursue our major growth initiatives.
But 2014 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced at record levels as Powers' fossil fleet achieved the safety performance in the top 10% of the industry. We successfully grew PSEG Solar Source's portfolio. In 2014, we added projects in 3 states that expanded Solar Source's portfolio to 123 megawatts of clean renewable energy. And we had a successful first year of operating the electric system of the Long Island Power Authority. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts of our PSEG Long Island team who were awarded with a major improvement in customer satisfaction scores. But let me be clear, this is only the beginning of a multiyear journey for us on Long Island.
Our core strategy, focused on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, is anticipated to yield a third year of growth in operating earnings over the coming year. For 2015, we are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission is expected to support continued growth in operating earnings in '15, as PSE&G's results for the full year are expected to represent more than 50% of consolidated earnings. PSEG Power is expected to report operating earnings in line with its strong 2014 results. The investments made by PSEG Power are expected to enhance the competitiveness of its environmentally well-positioned fleet. Capacity upgrades at our gas-fired combined cycle fleet and in our nuclear units will increase the fleet's output as Power's investment in the PennEast Pipeline enhances its already strong actions to low-cost gas for the Marcellus region. PSEG Power's fleet has the characteristics envisioned by PJM's proposed standards for capacity performance. Its diversity and dispatch and fuel mix, as well as the alternate fuel capability, mitigates operating risk. Power's investment program will be focused on improving its reliability during periods of stress on the system. We also look to expand the fleet when it's financially attractive. We were disappointed that our bid to construct a new 475-megawatt combined cycle plant at our Bridgeport Harbor site in Connecticut didn't clear the New England [indiscernible] recent capacity auction. However, we haven't abandoned this work, and we'll invest when the markets support its development.
The strategy we implemented has yielded growth. We have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that will support further expansion of our capital program over the next 5 years. The program is expected to yield double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base as we maintain the operating strength of Power's generating assets. We will update you on our capital spending plans on March 2. Our financial position remains strong, and acknowledgment of our success and the strength of our platform going forward was the recent decision by our Board of Directors to meaningfully increase the common dividend by 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend given our business mix. Our continued positive cash flow from our generation business and our strong financial position all support this dividend philosophy. We've made significant strides in meeting our objectives for growth as we also satisfy customer requirements, and we're not done. Of course, none of this would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated employees to our continued success.
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you in our March 2 annual financial conference.
I will now turn the call over to Caroline for more details on our results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after her remarks."

Our earnings for the fourth quarter bro",3004,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.49 per share, equal to operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.76 per share versus operating earnings for 2013 of $2.58 per share, or 7% growth.
On Slide 4, we have provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. And as you can see on Slide 10, PSE&G provided the largest contribution to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share last year. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share last year. Enterprise Other reported a small loss in operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.01 per share versus the operating loss of $0.03 per share reported in the fourth quarter of '13. We've provided you with waterfall charts on Slides 11 and 13 to take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings by major business.
So now I'll review each company in a bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. As I mentioned, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $0.32 per share compared with $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 as we show on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2014 operating earnings were $725 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with operating earnings of $612 million, or $1.21 per share for 2013, for growth of 18%. PSE&G's earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from lower operating expenses, including pensions, and a return on its expanded capital infrastructure program, which more than offset the impact of mild weather on sales.
PSE&G's investment in Transmission infrastructure increased its quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. The earnings improvement related to the investment in Transmission in the fourth quarter was less than the earnings increases you've seen during each of the first 3 quarters of the year, and this reflects a reduction in PSE&G's rate base at year-end associated with the deferred tax impact of the expansion of bonus depreciation. PSE&G's tight control of its operating expenses, including lower pension expense, resulted in a quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings of $0.04 per share. The continued improvement in weather-normalized gas volume and demand, which improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, was offset by a similar decline in electric volume and demand. And although you wouldn't think it on a day like today, weather was actually mild relative to normal and relative to the prior year, and that reduced earnings comparisons by about $0.01 per share. Earnings comparisons were also affected by the absence of $0.02 per share to tax-related change, which benefited earnings in the prior year.
Economic conditions continued to exhibit signs of an improvement in the service area which is good news. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 1% in the quarter and 3.1% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from a decline in the cost of gas, which is passed on to our residential customers, and an improvement in economic growth.
PSE&G announced earlier this month that it would extend through March of 2015 the credits against gas bills that it had already provided to residential customers for the months of November, December and January. A typical residential customer with these credits would experience savings on their total bill over the 5 months of approximately 31%, or $210.
Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have declined 2.3% in the fourth quarter. The decline in the quarter reflects a number of winter storms at the end of 2013 that increased residential consumption in that year, as well as decreases in demand this quarter from some large industrial customers. By the way, weather normalization is generally good for temperature, but unfortunately, there's not really a good way to adjust for storms. Overall, there was a 0.3% increase in weather-normalized electric demand for the year, which we think is indicative of improving economic conditions, partially offset by continued customer conservation.
PSE&G implemented an increase in Transmission revenue of $182 million effective on January 1 of this year. The increase in revenue under PSE&G's Transmission formula rate will provide PSE&G with recovery of and a return on its forecast of Transmission-related capital expenditures through the year. PSE&G's investment in Transmission grew to $4.5 billion at the end of 2014, or 39% of the company's consolidated rate base of $11.4 billion, and Transmission is forecast to be well over 40% of rate base as we go forward.
Let me just mention the impact of bonus depreciation. Expansion of bonus depreciation has the effect of reducing PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base with an increase in deferred taxes. We estimate PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base was reduced by approximately $150 million to $200 million from prior forecast levels, and this is reflected in PSE&G's year-end rate base of $11.4 billion. The impact of this change on 2015 revenues is not reflected in the formula rate increase that I just went through as that filing took place prior to the enactment of the extension of bonus depreciation. But our guidance for PSE&G reflects the impact on revenue associated with the extension of bonus depreciation, and we estimate that impact to be approximately $21 million. As you know, this is really a timing-related issue. We get the benefit of an increase in cash over the short term and see a decrease in the deferred tax balance over the long term.
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 are forecasted to grow to $735 million to $775 million. Our forecast for 2015 reflects the continued growth in PSE&G's Transmission-related rate base and the expansion of PSE&G's investment in distribution through the Energy Strong Program. Earnings for the full year will also be affected by a forecast increase in pension expense that will affect O&M, and I'll go into a little more detail on that shortly. We expect PSE&G's rate of earnings growth to improve beyond 2015 as the impact of bonus depreciation will annualize, and pension expense is expected to be lower under long-term return and interest rate assumptions.
PSE&G invested approximately $2.2 billion in 2014 on capital projects that improve the system's resilience and maintain its reliability. We currently forecast an increase in PSE&G's average capital spending for the next 3 years to about $2.4 billion per year. PSE&G's investment in Transmission will represent more than 50% of this new spending. We will be providing you with an updated forecast of PSE&G's capital expenditures by year for the 5-year period ending 2019 at our annual financial conference on March 2 of this year, and I can tell you, that spending plan remains robust.
Now let's turn to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, of $0.18 per share compared with $0.23 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $642 million, or $1.27 per share, compared to 2013's operating earnings of $710 million, or $1.40 per share. The earnings release, as well as Slides 11 and 13, provide you with detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and costs. We've also provided you with more detail on generation in the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. Power's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were influenced by the known decline in capacity revenues that we've discussed in prior calls, the monetization of Power's gas supply position and a reduction in operating and maintenance expense helped mitigate the effects of lower market prices for energy. As you recall, the average price for our PJM capacity declined to $166 per megawatt day from $244 per megawatt day on June 1 of 2014. The decline in price reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. A decline in the average hedge price for energy that Power realized during the quarter relative to year ago levels and lower market prices on Power's open position were more than offset by Power's ability to monetize its gas supply position. These items together led to an improvement in quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. A decline in Power's O&M expenditures during the quarter improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share. And the decline in expense for the quarter was greater than what we had been forecasting at the end of the third quarter. Power's management of maintenance outages at its fossil stations, coupled with the absence of outage-related expenditures in the prior year, resulted in a better than forecast reduction in O&M expense for the fourth year -- for the fourth quarter and led overall to lower O&M expense in 2014 versus the full year of 2013.
Now let's turn to the operations. Power's output increased 3.1% in the quarter from year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 1.3% to 54.2 terawatt hours. The fleet's flexibility and response to volatile market conditions was demonstrated in the quarter and throughout the year. The level of production achieved by the fleet in 2014 represented the third-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator. The nuclear fleet produced 29.1 terawatt hours, or 54% of generation, operating at an average capacity factor of 89.3%. Hope Creek experienced its second best year, operating at a 97.9 annual capacity factor, which helped to offset the impact of the extended refueling outage at Salem 2 earlier in 2014. The market is clearly rewarding efficient combined cycle gas units and Power's combined cycle fleet set a generation record during the year. The fleet produced 16.5 terawatt hours, or 30% of our generation during the year, with record levels of output from the Bergen station and Linden Unit 1. The coal fleet produced 7.4 terawatt hours, or 14% of generation, and the peaking fleet's responsiveness to market conditions, particularly the abnormally cold weather experienced at the start of 2014, led to full year production of 1.2 terawatt hours.
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower priced gas supplies in the Marcellus basin. For the year, gas from the Marcellus-Utica region supplied approximately 60% of the PJM asset's fuel requirements. This represents a larger percentage of the fleet's gas supply than was available in the past. Power's ability to step up its acquisition of gas from the Western Marcellus and Utica basin, in addition to the use of backhaul [ph] arrangements on existing pipe in the Eastern Marcellus, improved its access to this low-cost resource. This supply supports higher spark spreads that implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings similar to the levels it enjoyed in 2013 despite the decline in energy prices.
Overall, Power's gross margin per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter was $37.40 versus $45.90 last year, which was driven by the capacity price reset. For the year, gross margin amounted to $42.41 per megawatt hour versus $47.10 per megawatt hour last year, and Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margin for the quarter and the year. Power's forecasting a further improvement in output in 2015 to 55 to 57 terawatt hours. The increase is primarily the result of investments we have made to expand the capacity of our Nuclear and Combined Cycle fleet. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has hedged 100% of its baseload generation in 2015 and has hedged approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated total production for 2015 at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour, which compares favorably to the average hedge prices in 2014 of $48 per megawatt hour. Power had hedged approximately 50% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2016, estimated at 55 to 57 terawatt hours, also at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and '16 assumes BGS volumes represent approximately 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries, about comparable to the 11.5 terawatt hours we delivered in 2014 under BGS.
Based on our current hedge position for 2015, each $2 change in spark spreads would impact earnings by only $0.04 per share. This modest impact on earnings is a result of a higher percentage of output from our intermediate and peaking fleet that is hedged at this time about 40% to 45% than we had hedged a year ago when it was really about 35% to 40% of forecasted output for the intermediate and peaking fleet. For 2016, a $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by $0.06 per share. And just for your reference, if we were fully open, the $1 change in natural gas pricing would impact earnings by about $0.24 per share.
The BGS auction for PSE&G customers for the 3-year period beginning June 1 of 2015 and ending on May 31, 2018, was priced at $99.54 per megawatt hour. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the contract for $83.88 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31 of this year. This latest auction is based on an average price for energy at the PJM-West hub of about $37 to $38 per megawatt hour, which is similar to the base price for energy seen in the last 2 auctions. The BGS auction continues to represent a key means for Power to hedge basis associated with baseload output.
Power's hedging strategy is consistent with what you've seen in the past. Power maintains open positions on a portion of its intermediate and load-following assets, and this allows Power to capture any benefits associated with weather-related demand in the summer months and contain the risks associated with Full Requirements Contracts like BGS'. Power took advantage of market strength earlier in 2014 to hedge its output. And given favorable pricing, Power is also committed to serve a larger percentage of load under the BGS contract in this latest auction, which of course will have its proportional impact across the upcoming 3 years.
Power's operating earnings for 2015 are forecast at $620 million to $680 million. We're very pleased that our anticipated results are essentially in line with 2014's operating results. Comparative results for the full year will be affected by a decline in capacity revenues, which will essentially be fully offset by an increase in the average price received on energy hedges and a modest increase in O&M.
Turning to Enterprise and Other. PSEG Enterprise Other reported an operating earnings loss for the fourth quarter of $4 million, or about $0.01 per share, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $11 million, or $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. The results of the fourth quarter brought full year 2014 operating earnings to $33 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with 2013's operating loss of $13 million, or $0.03 per share. The difference in operating results quarter-over-quarter reflects primarily the absence of tax payments and other items which contributed $0.03 per share relative to the fourth quarter of 2013.
For 2015, operating earnings are forecasted to fall within the range of $40 million to $45 million, and results will be influenced by the contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island, income on the lease portfolio, including the benefit from the renegotiation and extension of our lease on the Grand Gulf nuclear generating facility.
Let me now just add a word about pension expense. Last year as you recall, we saw total pension income of about $0.02 per share as the success of our investment strategy created that pension income. In 2015, our funding level remains greater than 90%, but a lower discount rate and changes to mortality tables offset the continued strong return we generated on the trust, resulting in net pension expense of slightly less than $0.07 per share, which is split about evenly between PSE&G and Power. Keep in mind, these are noncash charges, and we anticipate a move back to pension income over the next 2 to 3-year period, given our solid funding and our long-term investment strategy. These impacts that I just mentioned are embedded in our financial plan and our guidance for growth at PSE&G and consistent performance in 2015 at Power. We still see a low-single digit growth in O&M across the company over the 3-year horizon, and we'll talk more about that in greater detail on March 2.
Lastly, just a word on our financial position. We're in great shape to finance our capital program. At the end of 2014, we had $402 million of cash on hand, and debt represented about 42% of our consolidated capital position with debted Power approximating 31% of its capital base and no parent debt. We'll be updating you on our capital program at our annual financial conference, but the message is the same. We can finance our robust long-term capital program and pursue a very healthy amount of growth opportunities without the need to issue equity, as we also provide our shareholders with a meaningful increase in the growth of the common dividend on a sustainable basis. We're pleased to be guiding to another year of anticipated growth in earnings for 2015 of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. Our forecast continues to reflect the benefits from PSE&G's expanded capital program and the dynamics of Power's fleet and access to low-cost gas supplies.
As you know, the common dividend was recently increased 5.4% to the indicative annual level of $1.56 per share, and we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward.
With that, Brandy, I'll turn it back to you, and we're now ready for your questions."

I have not been able to see the same price justification as others on asset acquisitions and a similar thing happened in New England. In general, we like the New England market from the point of view of newbuild because of the 7-year. That's a bigger hurdle to overcome in PJM because of the 1 year price. On the regular utility side, we'll give you more detail on March 2, but they're still very much a robust capital program that we'll be showing you for the 5 years. Not just in terms of Transmission, which has been our #1, but as we've talked about in the past, opportunities to accelerate the replacement of our cast iron main system in the gas business, as well as some of the components of the Energy Master Plan that relate to energy efficiencies and renewables. You may recall, it's only been 10 months or so, so I'm not suggesting we're done by any means, but Energy Strong was a much bigger program than what was ultimately approved. So there'll be more of that. But that's a little bit longer term than in the next coming months. So there's no shortage of opportunities to deploy the capital. We are disappointed about Bridgeport Harbor, I'm not going to deny that. But we've got things we can do."

It's a combination of modern basis in the summer, very strong basis in the winter and weak basis, in fact, negative basis in the shoulder periods. But the flexibility of our fleet and the way in which we hedge it takes all of that into account. Over the longer term, I think what you're going to see is the market dynamic that's going to be driven by significant infrastructure build of gas pipes from the Marcellus region to the Southeast and significant replacement of aging power plants that are unable to meet environmental standards in the Southeast with highly efficient natural gas combined cycles. So we're -- we don't run the business saying that we're smarter than the market, but to the extent that the market's view doesn't extend to that 3 to 5-year timeframe, we still have lots of reason to feel pretty confident in the location and quality of our asset base."

So if you look at what we told you on the third quarter call, we were still 100% hedged at the base load, but the differences really occurred as we've added hedges in that intermediate and peaking which was 5% to 10% for 2015 on the last call and is now 40% to 45%. Now of course, a piece of that would be BGS, but if you do the math on that, you'd see that's a little less than half of the total on an estimated basis. And really what's going on, Dan, and if you look at the curves, just look at the forward price curves, you can see this: there were opportunities where the prices moved up during the last quarter before they came down right at the very end, and spark spreads have been pretty robust. And so we took advantage of those opportunities to layer on incremental hedges. And by having that incremental flexibility and putting on a little bit more and capturing those price in sparks for opportunities, that's what's really increased the numbers. Now, if you're asking about the change in the price of base load, you know that we actually give one consistent price across. So even though base load was 100%, the average price of the entirety of the book, we put that across all the hedges. But we give you the granularity of where we're hedged between base load and intermediate and peaking. So we like the impact that we had in the fourth quarter by adding on hedges. You know that BGS, of course being Full Requirements also has some passthrough costs, but even if you strip that out, you'd find that the hedges are really higher than they were from our last report."

Because the things that we do control, the things we're doing to put capital to work obviously continue, and as I said, when you think about going out beyond '15, you'd see the annualization, right? The bonus depreciation in terms of a base versus a subsequent year effect. And then pension, obviously, we think being more of a onetime and then going back to normal.

But what of course, you can always think about for us that does sustain is that access, right? So we have the access this year, given what the team has been able to accomplish in terms of providing even more access to Leidy, Marcellus and Utica gas.

I mean, temperatures have been averaging about 16 degrees below average in the last few days, and plants are operating. But I think, I know for us and I suspect for others, there were some operational changes we were able to make, to reduce the amount of forced outages. Just in light of the forecast, we moved our coal piles around a little bit more so that we made sure that we don't face them freezing up. But what hasn't changed for us or -- and I suspect for others, the amount of capital investment that's being made in the older units which basically never run until you get 6 days averaging 16 degrees below 0. And I think FERC is very cognizant of that. So there's only so much you can get out of improved performance by doing some operational prep work, and eventually the frictional forces at these temperatures overcome whatever you might do in terms of preparation and those capital improvements are needed. And so I think FERC will be supportive. I don't want to predict any outcome. I don't want to guarantee an outcome. But suffice to say that there's really 2 issues that are involving making sure power plant will run: it's what you physically have put into the asset and what you do to ready it. And in terms of physical preparation, it is not leaving coal piles exposed, putting buildings around them so that they're protected from the elements. That's a capital investment, and you're not going to do that unless you know that you're going to get paid in the capacity market because those typically, in our case at least, aren't units that capture energy margin. So we're still cautiously optimistic about what FERC will do, and we are very confident that whatever FERC does, we'd give [ph] the type of fleet that will benefit from it."

So that work is probably going to be the longest dated one, and when we do file for additional help in that area, that's likely to not be offered at least another year. Another big part of Energy Strong, though, was a $350 million program to replace some of the cast iron main system and I think we've done over 200 miles of that already. And that is one that is scheduled to pretty much wind down by the end of '15. So we'll talk more in detail about that on March 2, but that is a filing that we will be making in very, very short order to continue that program. That's important for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is, number one, you don't want to keep mobilizing and then demobilizing a workforce to do that. And as I said, that's winding down at the end of the year. And probably equally, if not more important, is the fact that we've continued to be able to pass these gas credits onto our customers. So this is the time to make the investment in infrastructure while the supply part of the bill is actually coming down. Because it's something that the customer can afford to do right now. We're always mindful of the burden that we're putting on the customers. But there's some other parts of Energy Strong that are smaller in magnitude, but those being the 2 biggest ones. Some of the other things we've talked about in terms of potential investments that we're still waiting to hear on are the utility 2.0 program out on Long Island. Candidly, we thought that will be resolved by now, but that looks like it's going to go out a couple of more quarters into this year. We had thought we were the winner of the FERC 1000 project, the Artificial [ph] Island. As you know, PJM is reconsidering that and I don't know exactly when the decision will be forthcoming there. We thought it would be Q1, but Q1 is now halfway gone and that decision isn't done. The PennEast Pipeline investment we've made is still underway.

There is one that I just want to make special mention of the -- many of you probably have never met before.

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $1.04 per share. That's a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2014's operating earnings of $1.01 per share. PSE&G continues to achieve best-in-class growth as we expand investments that are helping meet our customers needs and helping New Jersey achieve important goals. PSE&G invested $599 million in the first quarter as part of its planned capital investment for 2015 of $2.6 billion and upgrades for the electric or gas distribution and transmission systems. PSE&G's capital program is on schedule and on budget. The Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV transmission line is expected to be fully operational later this month. This will be a major achievement. S-R's 2015 operational date is 12 years after the August 2003 blackout and almost a decade after PGM identified the critical system needs required to upgrade aging infrastructure and relieve overloaded power lines. S-R's completion is testament to the cooperative relationship between PSE&G and PPL Energy and the capabilities shown by PSE&G in navigating the lengthy permitting and licensing process at both the federal and state levels. PSE&G's investment in transmission represented 39% of its year-end 2014 rate base and is forecasted to grow an excess of 50% of rate base in 5 years. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently approved the expansion of PSE&G's successful energy efficiency programs. The investment of $95 million over next 3 years will decrease energy cost for participants and lessen the environmental effects of energy supply. At the same time, given the structure of the program, PSE&G should be able to fully earn its authorized return of 9.75%. In addition, the recommendation by PJM staff earlier this week to award PSE&G a share of the work required to upgrade reliability in Artificial Island will increase spending on transmission by anywhere from $100 million to $130 million. The AI investment, the Artificial Iowa investment, was not included in our capital program is described in our margin estimate investment conference, so this is an additive to our prior forecast of utility investment opportunities. 
We wait the BPU's action later this year on PSE&G's request to invest $1.6 billion over the next 5 years to continue its long-term program to modernize its gas systems. PSE&G's Gas System Modernization Program, which support the replacement of approximately 160 miles of [indiscernible] and unprotected gas veins per year. The replacement program will reduce the risk of leaks and it will reduce the leaks of methane gas. PSE&G has been replacing and modernizing its gas pipe as part of the Energy Strong Program. Approval of the Gas System Modernization Program which support the extension of this work and continue to provide a direct boost in New Jersey's economy with the creation of more than 500 jobs. We continue to believe that this is the optimal time to move ahead with this work given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices. Spending on this program would further enhance PSE&G's already strong growth platform. The first quarter was also for Power demonstrate the quality of its asset mix. PSE&G's Power's earnings continue to benefit from strong operations and the capable management of its gas supply. The fleet's dispatch flexibility and diverse fuel mix supported operations during this past winter. The gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines fleet availability improved quarter-over-quarter following conclusion of work at Linden in 2014 to increase its capacity and with the continued focus on operations. This improvement and availability aided the fleet's ability to respond to market conditions, and Power continues to benefit from the management of its gas storage and transportation agreements, which also provides substantial savings to PSE&G's residential gas customers. And in the latest development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has granted PJM's request to delay the RPM capacity auction. The delay provides more time for the FERC to consider PJM's proposed changes for the structure. We believe PJM's original net [indiscernible] proposal was just reasonable, but we support PJM's proposal of alternative [indiscernible] which the FERC agrees will allow for bids up to approximately 85% of net [indiscernible]. The FERC's approval of the proposed changes would recognize the need for increased investment to maintain systems reliability. The weather conditions experienced over the past 2 years expose the critical needs to maintain and improve on the resiliency of our infrastructure, the needs to replace aging equipment and maintain the level of service demanded by our customers. 
On a separate matter, I'm pleased with the outcome of the settlement we reached with our insurance over claims related to Superstorm Sandy losses. It's been more than 2 years since the storm affected our operations, but in the end, we've been fully compensated for the insurable spend we made on Sandy-related repairs. 
Our business model is working the way it should. Operational excellence produces the financial strength that allows us to invest in disciplined wafer growth. Our balance sheet is strong, the financial capabilities support our current plans to invest $13 billion for 2019 and it is sufficient to support an expansion of this investment program without the need to issue equity. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth and ratebase for 2019 as the earnings contributions from our regulated business exceeds 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG's Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability as we continue to look for opportunities to expand Power's fleet. The successful implementation of our investment plans will provide PSEG with a strong foundation to deliver customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Based on the strong starts to the current year, both operationally and financially, 2015 would represent a third-year of growth in PSEG's operating earnings. But given that, it is still early in 2015. We are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 per share to $2.90 per share. We have a proven strategy and a key contributor to our success are the dedication of our employees to meeting the needs of customers in a safe and reliable manner. Their skills and talent are what will propel us to achieve our long-term goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $1.04 per share versus operating earnings of $1.01 per share in last year's first quarter. We provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on Slide 8, PSEG Power provided the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share last year. In addition, Power reported adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared to $651 million last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSEG Enterprise Other or the parent contributed operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business and I'll now review each company in a bit more detail. 
Let's turn to PSE&G. As shown on Slide 11, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSE&G's earnings for the first quarter reflect the benefits of the increase in revenue associated with the expansion of its capital program, an increase in demand for gas on the recovery of insurable storm costs from the settlement of Sandy-related insurance claims. PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.6 billion on transmission in 2015 and under PSE&G's formula rate, an increase in transmission revenue of $182 million was effective at the start of the year. This increase in revenue provides the recovery of known costs and appropriate returns associated with PSE&G's expanded transmission investment. The winter weather was significantly colder than normal and colder than a year ago. Of course, the gas weather normalization clause negates the impact of weather from earnings from PSE&G's Gas Distribution business, however, growth in customer demand for gas normalized for weather added $0.01 per share in earnings. Quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons also benefited from a decline in operation and maintenance expense of $0.01 per share. Decline in O&M reflects the expense portion of PSE&G's share of the Sandy-related insurance settlement and a decline in storm-related repair costs from the higher levels experienced in 2014's first quarter. Together, these more than offset the impact on O&M from an increase in pension expense. 
Economic indicators on the service area are modestly better than a year ago. Employment and housing indicators show signs of slow but steady improvement. Electric demand have also shown modest improvement, and I stress the word modest in characterizing demand growth. On a weather-normalized basis, electric sales are estimated to have improved by 0.2% in the quarter and the improvement was led by a 0.6% growth from the commercial and industrial sector, which offset the decline in demand from residential customers. Gas deliveries on the other hand continue to benefit from sustained low commodity prices and the signals of recovery in the economy. Weather-normalized gas deliveries in the quarter grew by 0.4% based on a 1% improvement from the residential sector. PSE&G extended bill credits that have provided for residential gas usage for the prior 5 months through April. The April bill credits cut the average bill from the typical residential customer by 32%. PSE&G received approval from the New Jersey BPU in April of 2015 to increase its investment in energy efficiency. PSE&G will invest an additional $95 million over a 3-year period and an authorized return on equity of 9.75%. The approval will allow PSE&G to expand its energy efficiency initiatives under several popular programs. And the structure under the agreement for revenue and cost recovery should allow PSE&G to fully earn its authorized return.  We're maintaining our forecast with PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 of $735 million to $775 million. PSE&G's earnings for the full year will be driven by the recovery of costs associated with higher-level of capital spending. 
Let's now move to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared with $0.58 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $651 million for the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same item as our operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance that powers fossil generation facilities. PSEG Power's strong operating results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in availability of its a gas-fired combined cycle fleet, higher prices on its hedged energy output on the monetization of its gas supply. Together, these helped offset the impact on earnings from a decline in capacity revenues and lower wholesale market prices for energy. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with an increase in the percent of energy hedged in the first quarter relative to a year ago fully offset the impact to lower wholesale market prices on earnings. The expected decline in average PJM capacity prices to $168 per megawatt day from $242 per megawatt day last year reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher gas send out to commercial and industrial customers and strong margins on sales to be off system market in response to the extreme weather conditions experienced throughout the quarter added $0.04 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings. The actions of the charge in the prior year improved earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share, and lastly, earnings comparisons were reduced by $0.01 per share due to an increase in O&M expense. The changes and adjusted EBITDA directly parallel the change of earnings per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The earnings release on Slide 16 provides you with detailed analysis on the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter from changes in revenue and costs. 
Let me now just take a moment to mention our inclusion of adjusted EBITDA, as both new disclosure and new guidance. We know that if any of you track one or both operating earnings and EBITDA for Power and we thought that by giving you our EBITDA on the same basis as operating earnings unadjusted for fossil major maintenance expenses, this would give you a better window into Power's cash flow generation potential and value over the long-term. We took out major maintenance at our fossil plants as this is a periodic costs versus the ongoing run rate. As I mentioned, the changes in operating earnings aligns with the changes in adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the reduction in EPS of $0.03 per share associated with lower wholesale energy market prices and slightly higher O&M equates directly to the $25 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA from $651 million in 2014's first quarter to $626 million in this quarter. I plan to talk about adjusted EBITDA every quarter as we go forward to ensure we provide you with a consistent view as many of you use this for modeling purposes. 
Now let's turn for a few minutes to Power's operations. Essentially, this is a tale of 2 winters. As you remember, the past winter was one of the coldest on record and actually colder than 2014's winter. But this past winter was also characterized by improved availability of gas supply and fewer days of extreme weather in the year-ago period, which resulted in dramatically lower wholesale energy prices than a year ago when the market reflected scarcity pricing for much longer period of time. The decline in wholesale energy prices in the first quarter of 2015 from the first quarter of 2014 affected the financial performance of Power's assets that were open to the market. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges of about $4 per megawatt hour on approximately 76% of generation hedged helps secure Power's margins during the first quarter. The net impact of the higher hedge price was offset somewhat by the need to meet increased demand under load following contracts at fixed prices. The net impact on profitability on Power's load following contracts, however, was not [indiscernible] as the year-ago period for the reasons I just mentioned. Once again, Power's ability to monetize gas price position offset this market, energy market impacts resulting in only a slight decline in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter as I mentioned to $626 million from last year's $651 million. The flexibility and fuel diversity of Power's suite supported strong operations in the cold weather conditions experienced in the first quarter. Output of 14.5 terawatt hours was in line with year ago levels. The nuclear fleet operated an average capacity factor of 95%, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output or 54% of generation. This is just a slight decline from the year ago levels. Production from the combined cycle fleet increased to 3.9 terawatt hours or 27% of generation, and this represents a 16% increase in output versus 2014's first quarter. An improvement in the availability at Linden following work should increase the station's capacity and the availability of the vessel New York capacity with an increase in gas supply led to entire production from the combined cycle fleet. The combined cycle fleet's operation was also aided by its use of oil as backup supply to maintain operations during important critical periods. The [indiscernible] stations performed in line with prior period, producing about 2.5 terawatt hours of energy or about 17% of generation. Finally, output from the peaking fleet declined in response to fewer days of extreme weather. 
Power is maintaining its forecast of output for 2015 of between 55 and 57 terawatt hours, a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of this year is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. For 2016, Power has hedged between 50% and 55% of its forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of its forecast generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and 2016 continues to assume volumes hedged under [indiscernible] represents approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours for each year. We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2015 of $620 million to $680 million. The forecast of operating earnings represents forecasts of adjusted EBITDA of $1,545,000,000 to $1,645,000,000 for the full year which compares to $1,584,000,000 -- $1,584,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2014. Results for the remainder of the year will be heavily influenced by an increase in the average price of hedged energy and the expected decline in year-over-year capacity revenue. I want to remind you that the average price Power's [indiscernible] for its PJM's capacity is expected to remain at $168 per megawatt day for the past year which begins on June 1 of 2015. At this time, the number of megawatts of capacity for which Power receives revenue in PJM is expected to decline by 1,800 megawatts, and this reflects primarily the retirement of the ATD units which we've talked about before.  Slide 17 provides more detail on generation in the quarter, and Slide 21, provides detail on Power's hedge position. 
Now let me briefly address the operating results from Enterprise and Other. For the first quarter, PSEG enterprise other reported operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with operating earnings of a penny per share last year. The difference in operating income is from the the result of favorable interest in other income, contribution to income from PSEG Long Island and the lease portfolio was steady quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2015 from PSEG Enterprise Other of $40 million to $45 million. Finally, just a word on the settlement of the Sandy insurance claims, as Ralph mentioned earlier, we are very pleased that we were able to reach a settlement of claims with our insurers for coverage of Superstorm Sandy-related losses. the settlement provides for total recovery of $264 million and announced it fully compensates PSEG for insurable spending on Sandy-related repairs. PSEG received $15 million [ph] of this amount over the 2012, 2013 period which you probably remember I'm talking about. Of the remaining $214 million, PSEG recognized $159 million pretax in the first quarter's result under a partial settlement reached with insurers and we will recognize an additional $54 million pretax in the second quarter. Power's share of the settlement proceeds are not included in operating earnings or adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. As you recall, those expenses when incurred were not included in Power's operating earnings at that time and this settlement fully closes out the claim related to  Sandy. 
PSEG closed the quarter with $1 billion of cash on its balance sheet what debt at the end of March 31 2015, representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. The level of cash on the balance sheet is high relative to normal conditions, and this reflects the cash impact of bonus depreciation on taxes and includes the receipt of Sandy-related insurance proceeds all both occurring, of course, at a time during the year when seasonal influences on demand had a favorable impact on cash balances. We remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity, and we look forward to seeking additional growth investments. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 to $2.95 per share. 
So that concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, to open up the lines for questions."

I actually have some broader concerns about it that the success of any market is in the fact that you have multiple buyers and multiple sellers and you have visibility to pricing and the needs of customers.

So a couple of things to remember. So on the Power side, we don't flow through operating earnings, that's below the line which you can see in the reconciliation. We don't do that because Power spend was below the line as well. And on the utility side, remember that the recoveries that we got, including a portion of the 50 -- a small portion of that was for PSE&G in past. It goes primarily to balance sheet because a lot of the spend for storm recovery that's recoverable under our policies, capital spend and that's on the balance sheet so there's balance sheet and regulatory offset and just $0.01 of impact for the P&L from the first quarter for Sandy at PSE&G. And we do the second quarter piece when we do the second quarter results."

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $1.04 per share. That's a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2014's operating earnings of $1 per share. PSE&G continues to achieve best-in-class growth, as we expand investments that are helping meet our customers' needs and helping New Jersey achieve important goals. PSE&G invested $599 million in the first quarter as part of its planned capital investment for 2015 of $2.6 billion in upgrades for the electric and gas distribution and transmission systems. PSE&G's capital program is on schedule and on budget. The Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV transmission line is expected to be fully operational later this month. This will be a major achievement. S-R's 2015 operational date is 12 years after the August 2003 blackout and almost a decade after PJM identified the critical system needs required to upgrade aging infrastructure and relieve overloaded power lines. S-R's completion is a testament to the cooperative relationship between PSE&G and PPL Energy and the capabilities shown by PSE&G in navigating the lengthy permitting and licensing process at both the federal and state levels. PSE&G's investment in transmission represented 39% of its year-end 2014 rate base, and it  is forecast to grow to represent an excess of 50% of rate base in 5 years. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently approved the expansion of PSE&G's successful energy efficiency programs. The investment of $95 million over the next 3 years will decrease energy cost for participants and lessen the environmental effects of energy supply. At the same time, given the structure of the program, PSE&G should be able to fully earn its authorized return of 9.75%. In addition, the recommendation by PJM staff earlier this week to award PSE&G a share of the work required to upgrade reliability in Artificial Island would increase spending on transmission by anywhere from $100 million to $130 million. The AI investment, the Artificial Island investment, was not included in our capital program, as described in our March Investor Conference, so this is an additive to our prior forecasting of utility investment opportunities.
We await the BPU's action later this year on PSE&G's request to invest $1.6 billion over the next 5 years to continue its long-term program to modernize its gas systems. PSE&G's Gas System Modernization Program, which supports the replacement of approximately 160 miles of cast iron and unprotected yield gas mains per year. The replacement program would reduce the risk of leaks, and it would reduce the release of methane gas. PSE&G has been replacing and modernizing its gas pipe as part of the Energy Strong program. Approval of the Gas System Modernization Program would support the extension of this work and continue to provide a direct boost in New Jersey's economy with the creation of more than 500 jobs. We continue to believe that this is the optimal time to move ahead with this work, given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices. Spending on this program would further enhance PSE&G's already strong growth platform. The first quarter results for Power demonstrate the quality of its asset mix. PSE&G's Power's earnings continue to benefit from strong operations and the capable management of its gas supply. The fleet's dispatch flexibility and diverse fuel mix supported operations during this past winter. The gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines fleet availability improved quarter-over-quarter following conclusion of work at Linden in 2014 to increase its capacity and with the continued focus on operations. This improvement and availability aided the fleet's ability to respond to market conditions. And Power continues to benefit from the management of its gas storage and transportation agreements, which also provide substantial savings to PSE&G's residential gas customers. And in the latest development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has granted PJM's request to delay the RPM capacity auction. The delay provides more time for the FERC to consider PJM's proposed changes for the auction structure. We believe PJM's original net CONE offer cap proposal was just reasonable, but we support PJM's proposal of alternative offer cap, which, if the FERC agrees, will allow for bids up to approximately 85% of net CONE. The FERC's approval of the proposed changes would recognize the need for increased investment to maintain system reliability. The weather conditions experienced over the past 2 years expose the critical needs to maintain and improve on the resiliency of our infrastructure -- the need to replace aging equipment and maintain the level of service demanded by our customers.
On a separate matter, I'm pleased with the outcome of the settlement we reached with our insurance over claims related to Superstorm Sandy losses. It's been more than 2 years since the storm affected our operations. But in the end, we've been fully compensated for the insurable spending we made on Sandy-related repairs.
Our business model is working the way it should. Operational excellence produces the financial strength that allows us to invest in a disciplined wafer growth. Our balance sheet is strong. The financial capability supports our current plans to invest $13 billion for 2019, and it is sufficient to support an expansion of this investment program without the need to issue equity. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth and rate base for 2019, as the earnings contribution from our regulated business exceeds 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG's Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability, as we continue to look for opportunities to expand Power's fleet. The successful implementation of our investment plans will provide PSEG with a strong foundation to deliver customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Based on the strong start to the current year, both operationally and financially, 2015 would represent a third year of growth in PSEG's operating earnings. But given that it is still early in 2015, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 per share to $2.95 per share. We have a proven strategy, and a key contributor to our success is the dedication of our employees to meeting the needs of customers in a safe, reliable manner. Their skills and talent are what will propel us to achieve our long-term goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $1.04 per share versus operating earnings of $1.01 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on Slide 8, PSEG Power provided the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share last year. In addition, Power reported adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared to $651 million last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSEG Enterprise/Other or the parent contributed operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and I'll now review each company in a bit more detail.
Let's turn to PSE&G. As shown on Slide 11, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSE&G's earnings for the first quarter reflect the benefits of the increase in revenue associated with the expansion of its capital program, an increase in demand for gas and the recovery of insurable storm costs from the settlement of Sandy-related insurance claims. PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.6 billion on transmission in 2015 and under PSE&G's formula rate, an increase in transmission revenue of $182 million was effective at the start of the year. This increase in revenue provides for recovery of known costs and appropriate returns associated with PSE&G's expanded transmission investment. The winter weather was significantly colder than normal and colder than a year ago. Of course, the gas weather normalization clause negates the impact of weather on earnings from PSE&G's Gas Distribution business; however, growth in customer demand for gas normalized for weather added $0.01 per share in earnings. Quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons also benefited from a decline in operational and maintenance expense of $0.01 per share. Decline in O&M reflects the expense portion of PSE&G's share of the Sandy-related insurance settlement and a decline in storm-related repair costs from the higher levels experienced in 2014's first quarter. Together, these more than offset the impact on O&M from an increase in pension expense.
Economic indicators on the service area are modestly better than a year ago. Employment and housing indicators show slow -- show signs of slow but steady improvement. Electric demand has also shown modest improvement, and I stress the word ""modest"" in characterizing demand growth. On a weather-normalized basis, electric sales are estimated to have improved by 0.2% in the quarter, and the improvement was led by a 0.6% growth from the commercial and industrial sector, which offset a decline in demand from residential customers. Gas deliveries on the other hand continue to benefit from sustained low commodity prices, and this signals of recovery in the economy.
Weather-normalized gas deliveries in the quarter grew by 0.4% based on a 1% improvement from the residential sector. PSE&G extended bill credits that I had provided for residential gas usage for the prior 5 months through April. The April bill credits cut the average bill from the typical residential customer by 32%. PSE&G received approval from the New Jersey BPU in April of 2015 to increase its investment in energy efficiency. PSE&G will invest an additional $95 million over a 3-year period and an authorized return on equity of 9.75%. The approval will allow PSE&G to expand its energy efficiency initiatives under several popular programs. And the structure under the agreement for revenue and cost recovery should allow PSE&G to fully earn its authorized return. We're maintaining our forecast with PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 of $735 million to $775 million. PSE&G's earnings for the full year will be driven by the recovery of costs associated with higher-level capital spending.
Let's now move to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared with $0.58 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $651 million for the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance that powers fossil generation facilities. PSEG Power's strong operating results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in availability of its gas-fired combined cycle fleet, higher prices on its hedged energy output, on the monetization of its gas supply. Together, these helped offset the impact on earnings from a decline in capacity revenues and lower wholesale market prices for energy. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with an increase in the percent of energy hedged in the first quarter relative to a year ago, fully offset the impact to lower wholesale market prices on earnings. The expected decline in average PJM capacity prices to $168 per megawatt day from $242 per megawatt day last year reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher gas send-out to commercial and industrial customers and strong margins on sales to the off-system market in response to the extreme weather conditions experienced throughout the quarter added $0.04 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings. The absence of a charge in the prior year improved earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. And lastly, earnings comparisons were reduced by $0.01 per share due to an increase in O&M expense. The changes in adjusted EBITDA directly parallel the changes in earnings per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The earnings release on Slide 16 provides you with detailed analysis on the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter from changes in revenue and costs.
Let me now just take a moment to mention our inclusion of adjusted EBITDA, as both new disclosure and new guidance. We know that many of you track one or both, operating earnings and EBITDA, for Power, and we thought that by giving you our EBITDA on the same basis as operating earnings, unadjusted for fossil major maintenance expenses, this would give you a better window into Power's cash flow generation potential and value over the long term. We took out major maintenance of our fossil plants as this is a periodic cost versus the ongoing run rate. As I mentioned, the changes in operating earnings align with the changes in adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the reduction in EPS of $0.03 per share associated with lower wholesale energy market prices and slightly higher O&M equates directly to the $25 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA from $651 million in 2014's first quarter to $626 million in this quarter. I plan to talk about adjusted EBITDA every quarter as we go forward to ensure we provide you with a consistent view, as many of you use this for modeling purposes.
Now let's turn for a few minutes to Power's operations. Essentially, this is a tale of 2 winters. As you remember, the past winter was one of the coldest on record and actually colder than 2014's winter. But this past winter was also characterized by improved availability of gas supply and fewer days of extreme weather in the year-ago period, which resulted in dramatically lower wholesale energy prices than a year ago when the market reflected scarcity pricing for much longer period of time. The decline in wholesale energy prices in the first quarter of 2015 from the first quarter of 2014 affected the financial performance of Power's assets that were open to the market. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges of about $4 per megawatt hour on approximately 76% of generation hedged helped secure Power's margins during the first quarter. The net impact of the higher hedge price was offset somewhat by the need to meet increased demand under load-following contracts at fixed prices. The net impact on profitability on Power's load-following contracts, however, was not as severe as in the year-ago period for the reasons I just mentioned. Once again, Power's ability to monetize gas price position offset this market -- energy market impacts, resulting in only a slight decline in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, as I mentioned, to $626 million from last year's $651 million. The flexibility and fuel diversity of Power's suite supported strong operations in the cold weather conditions experienced in the first quarter. Output of 14.5 terawatt hours was in line with year-ago level. The nuclear fleet operated an average capacity factor of 95%, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output or 54% of generation. This is just a slight decline from the year-ago level. Production from the combined cycle fleet increased to 3.9 terawatt hours or 27% of generation. This represents a 16% increase in output versus 2014's first quarter. An improvement in the availability at Linden following work to increase the station's capacity and the availability of the Bethlehem, New York capacity with an increase in gas supply led to higher production from the combined cycle fleet. The combined cycle fleet's operation was also aided by its use of oil as backup supply to maintain operations during important critical periods. The coal stations performed in line with prior period, producing about 2.5 terawatt hours of energy or about 17% of generation. Finally, output from the peaking fleet declined in response to fewer days of extreme weather.
Power is maintaining its forecast of output for 2015 of between 55 and 57 terawatt hours, a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately, 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of this year is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. For 2016, Power has hedged between 50% and 55% of its forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of its forecast generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and 2016 continues to assume volumes hedged under BGS, represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours for each year. We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2015 of $620 million to $680 million. The forecast of operating earnings represents forecast of adjusted EBITDA of $1,545,000,000 to $1,645,000,000 for the full year, which compares to $1,584,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2014. Results for the remainder of the year will be heavily influenced by an increase in the average price of hedged energy and the expected decline in year-over-year capacity revenue. I want to remind you that the average price [indiscernible] for its PJM capacity is expected to remain at 168 megawatt -- $168 per megawatt day for the capacity year, which begins on June 1 of 2015. At the same time, the number of megawatts of capacity for which Power receives revenue in PJM is expected to decline by 1,800 megawatts. And this reflects primarily the retirement of the HEDD units, which we've talked about before. Slide 17 provides more detail on generation in the quarter, and Slide 21 provides detail on Power's hedge position.
Now, let me briefly address the operating results from Enterprise/Other. For the first quarter, PSEG Enterprise/Other reported operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with operating earnings of a penny per share last year. The difference in operating income is primarily the result of favorable interest in other income, contribution to income from PSEG-Long Island, and the lease portfolio was steady quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2015 on PSEG Enterprise/Other of $40 million to $45 million. Finally, just a word on the settlement of the Sandy insurance claims. As Ralph mentioned earlier, we're very pleased that we were able to reach a settlement of claims with our insurers for coverage of Superstorm Sandy-related losses. the settlement provides for total recovery of $264 million, an amount that fully compensates PSEG for insurable spending on Sandy-related repairs. PSEG received $15 million of this amount over the 2012, 2013 period, which you probably remember our talking about. Of the remaining $214 million, PSEG recognized $159 million pretax in the first quarter's result under a partial settlement reached with insurers, and we will recognize an additional $54 million pretax in the second quarter. Power's share of the settlement proceeds are not included in operating earnings or adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. As you recall, those expenses when incurred were not included in Power's operating earnings at that time, and this settlement fully closes out the claim related to Sandy.
PSEG closed the quarter with $1 billion of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of March 31, 2015, representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. The level of cash on the balance sheet is high relative to normal conditions, and this reflects the cash impact of bonus depreciation on taxes and includes the receipt of Sandy-related insurance proceeds all -- both occurring, of course, at a time during the year when seasonal influences on demand had a favorable impact on cash balances. We remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity, and we look forward to seeking additional growth investments. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 to $2.95 per share.
So that concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, to open up the lines for questions."

The remaining piece of the settlement that we have, the remaining, about $54 million, we have to go through the allocation process, and we will do that and we'll discuss how that will flow when we do the second quarter results. So a couple of things to remember. So on the Power side, we don't flow through operating earnings, that's below the line which you can see in the reconciliation. We don't do that because Power spend was below the line as well. And on the utility side, remember that the recoveries that we got, including a portion of the 50 -- a small portion of that, that for PSE&G in past. It goes primarily to balance sheet because a lot of the spend for storm recovery that's recoverable under our policies, capital spend and that's on the balance sheet. So there's balance sheet regulatory asset offset and just $0.01 of impact for the P&L from the first quarter for Sandy at PSE&G.

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $1.04 per share. That's a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2014's operating earnings of $1.01 per share. PSE&G continues to achieve best-in-class growth, as we expand investments that are helping meet our customers' needs and helping New Jersey achieve important goals. PSE&G invested $599 million in the first quarter as part of its planned capital investment for 2015 of $2.6 billion in upgrades for the electric and gas distribution and transmission systems. PSE&G's capital program is on schedule and on budget. The Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV transmission line is expected to be fully operational later this month. This will be a major achievement. S-R's 2015 operational date is 12 years after the August 2003 blackout and almost a decade after PJM identified the critical system needs required to upgrade aging infrastructure and relieve overloaded power lines. S-R's completion is a testament to the cooperative relationship between PSE&G and PPL Energy and the capabilities shown by PSE&G in navigating the lengthy permitting and licensing process at both the federal and state levels. PSE&G's investment in transmission represented 39% of its year-end 2014 rate base, and it is forecast to grow to represent an excess of 50% of rate base in 5 years. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently approved an expansion of PSE&G's successful energy efficiency programs. The investment of $95 million over the next 3 years will decrease energy costs for participants and lessen the environmental effects of energy supply. At the same time, given the structure of the program, PSE&G should be able to fully earn its authorized return of 9.75%. In addition, the recommendation by PJM staff earlier this week to award PSE&G a share of the work required to upgrade reliability in Artificial Island would increase spending on transmission by anywhere from $100 million to $130 million. The AI investment, the Artificial Island investment, was not included in our capital program as described in our March Investor Conference, so this is an additive to our prior forecasting of utility investment opportunities.
We await the BPU's action later this year on PSE&G's request to invest $1.6 billion over the next 5 years to continue its long-term program to modernize its gas systems. PSE&G's Gas System Modernization Program would support the replacement of approximately 160 miles of cast iron and unprotected field gas mains per year. The replacement program would reduce the risk of leaks, and it would reduce the release of methane gas. PSE&G has been replacing and modernizing its gas pipe as part of the Energy Strong program. Approval of the Gas System Modernization Program would support the extension of this work and continue to provide a direct boost to New Jersey's economy with the creation of more than 500 jobs. We continue to believe that this is the optimal time to move ahead with this work, given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices. Spending on this program would further enhance PSE&G's already strong growth platform. The first quarter results for Power demonstrate the quality of its asset mix. PSE&G's Power's earnings continue to benefit from strong operations and the capable management of its gas supply. The fleet's dispatch flexibility and diverse fuel mix supported operations during this past winter. The gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines fleet availability improved quarter-over-quarter following conclusion of work at Linden in 2014 to increase its capacity and with the continued focus on operations. This improvement and availability aided the fleet's ability to respond to market conditions. And Power continues to benefit from the management of its gas storage and transportation agreements, which also provide substantial savings to PSE&G's residential gas customers. And in the latest development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has granted PJM's request to delay the RPM capacity auction. The delay provides more time for the FERC to consider PJM's proposed changes to the auction structure. We believe PJM's original net CONE offer cap proposal was just and reasonable, but we support PJM's proposal of alternative offer cap, which, if the FERC agrees, would allow for bids up to approximately 85% of net CONE. The FERC's approval of the proposed changes would recognize the need for increased investment to maintain system reliability. The weather conditions experienced over the past 2 years expose the critical need to maintain and improve on the resiliency of our infrastructure, the need to replace aging equipment and maintain the level of service demanded by our customers.
On a separate matter, I'm pleased with the outcome of the settlement we reached with our insurance over claims related to Superstorm Sandy losses. It's been more than 2 years since the storm affected our operations. But in the end, we've been fully compensated for the insurable spending we made on Sandy-related repairs.
Our business model is working the way it should. Operational excellence produces the financial strength that allows us to invest in a disciplined way for growth. Our balance sheet is strong. This financial capability supports our current plans to invest $13 billion for 2019, and it is sufficient to support an expansion of this investment program without the need to issue equity. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth in rate base through 2019, as the earnings contribution from our regulated business exceeds 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG's Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability, as we continue to look for opportunities to expand Power's fleet. The successful implementation of our investment plans will provide PSEG with a strong foundation to deliver customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Based on the strong start to the current year, both operationally and financially, 2015 would represent the third year of growth in PSEG's operating earnings. But given that it is still early in 2015, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 per share to $2.95 per share. We have a proven strategy, and a key contributor to our success is the dedication of our employees to meeting the needs of customers in a safe, reliable manner. Their skills and talent are what will propel us to achieve our long-term goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $1.04 per share versus operating earnings of $1.01 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on Slide 8, PSEG Power provided the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share last year. In addition, Power reported adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared to $651 million last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSEG Enterprise/Other, or the parent, contributed operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and I'll now review each company in a bit more detail.
Let's turn to PSE&G. As shown on Slide 11, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSE&G's earnings for the first quarter reflect the benefits of the increase in revenue associated with the expansion of its capital program, an increase in demand for gas and the recovery of insurable storm costs from the settlement of Sandy-related insurance claims. PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.6 billion on transmission in 2015 and under PSE&G's formula rate, an increase in transmission revenue of $182 million was effective at the start of the year. This increase in revenue provides for recovery of known costs and appropriate returns associated with PSE&G's expanded transmission investment. The winter weather was significantly colder than normal and colder than a year ago. Of course, the gas weather normalization clause negates the impact of weather on earnings from PSE&G's gas distribution business. However, growth in customer demand for gas normalized for weather added $0.01 per share in earnings. Quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons also benefited from a decline in operation and maintenance expense of $0.01 per share. Decline in O&M reflects the expense portion of PSE&G's share of the Sandy-related insurance settlement and a decline in storm-related repair costs from the higher levels experienced in 2014's first quarter. Together, these more than offset the impact on O&M from an increase in pension expense.
Economic indicators in the service area are modestly better than a year ago. Employment and housing indicators show slow -- show signs of slow but steady improvement. Electric demand has also shown modest improvement, and I stress the word ""modest"" in characterizing demand growth. On a weather-normalized basis, electric sales are estimated to have improved by 0.2% in the quarter, and the improvement was led by a 0.6% growth from the commercial and industrial sector, which offset a decline in demand from residential customers. Gas deliveries, on the other hand, continue to benefit from sustained low commodity prices, and this signals of recovery in the economy.
Weather-normalized gas deliveries in the quarter grew by 0.4% based on a 1% improvement from the residential sector. PSE&G extended bill credits that it had provided for residential gas usage for the prior 5 months through April. The April bill credits cut the average bill for the typical residential customer by 32%. PSE&G received approval from the New Jersey BPU in April of 2015 to increase its investment in energy efficiency. PSE&G will invest an additional $95 million over a 3-year period and an authorized return on equity of 9.75%. The approval will allow PSE&G to expand its energy efficiency initiatives under several popular programs. And the structure under the agreement for revenue and cost recovery should allow PSE&G to fully earn its authorized return. We're maintaining our forecast with PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 of $735 million to $775 million. PSE&G's earnings for the full year will be driven by the recovery of costs associated with higher levels of capital spending.
Let's now move to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared with $0.58 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $651 million for the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance that powers fossil generation facilities. PSEG Power's strong operating results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in availability of its gas-fired combined cycle fleet, higher prices on its hedged energy output and the monetization of its gas supply. Together, these helped offset the impact on earnings from a decline in capacity revenue and lower wholesale market prices for energy. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with an increase in the percent of energy hedged in the first quarter relative to a year ago, fully offset the impact of lower wholesale market prices on earnings. The expected decline in average PJM capacity prices to $168 per megawatt day from $242 per megawatt day last year reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher gas send-out to commercial and industrial customers and strong margins on sales to the off-system market in response to the extreme weather conditions experienced throughout the quarter added $0.04 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings. The absence of a charge in the prior year improved earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. And lastly, earnings comparisons were reduced by $0.01 per share due to an increase in O&M expense. The changes in adjusted EBITDA directly parallel the changes in earnings per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The earnings release on Slide 16 provides you with detailed analysis on the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter from changes in revenue and costs.
Let me now just take a moment to mention our inclusion of adjusted EBITDA, as both new disclosure and new guidance. We know that many of you track one or both, operating earnings and EBITDA, for Power, and we thought that by giving you our EBITDA on the same basis as operating earnings and adjusted for fossil major maintenance expenses, this would give you a better window into Power's cash flow generation potential and value over the long term. We took out major maintenance of our fossil plants as this is a periodic cost versus the ongoing run rate. As I mentioned, the changes in operating earnings align with the changes in adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the reduction in EPS of $0.03 per share associated with lower wholesale energy market prices and slightly higher O&M equates directly to the $25 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA from $651 million in 2014's first quarter to $626 million in this quarter. I plan to talk about adjusted EBITDA every quarter as we go forward to ensure we provide you with a consistent view, as many of you use this for modeling purposes.
Now let's turn for a few minutes to Power's operations. Essentially, this is a tale of 2 winters. As you remember, the past winter was one of the coldest on record and actually colder than 2014's winter. But this past winter was also characterized by improved availability of gas supply and fewer days of extreme weather than the year-ago period, which resulted in dramatically lower wholesale energy prices than a year ago when the market reflected scarcity pricing for a much longer period of time. The decline in wholesale energy prices in the first quarter of 2015 from the first quarter of 2014 affected the financial performance of Power's assets that were open to the market. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges of about $4 per megawatt hour on approximately 76% of generation hedged helped secure Power's margins during the first quarter. The net impact of the higher hedge price was offset somewhat by the need to meet increased demand under load-following contracts at fixed prices. The net impact on profitability of Power's load-following contracts, however, was not as severe as in the year-ago period for the reasons I just mentioned. Once again, Power's ability to monetize its gas supply position offset theses market -- energy market impacts, resulting in only a slight decline in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, as I mentioned, to $626 million from last year's $651 million. The flexibility and fuel diversity of Power's fleet supported strong operations in the cold weather conditions experienced in the first quarter. Output of 14.5 terawatt hours was in line with year-ago levels. The nuclear fleet operated an average capacity factor of 95%, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output or 54% of generation. This is just a slight decline from year-ago levels. Production from the combined cycle fleet increased to 3.9 terawatt hours or 27% of generation. This represents a 16% increase in output versus 2014's first quarter. An improvement in the availability at Linden following work to increase the station's capacity and the availability of the Bethlehem, New York facility with an increase in gas supply led to higher production from the combined cycle fleet. The combined cycle fleet's operation was also aided by its use of oil as backup supply to maintain operations during important critical periods. The coal stations performed in line with prior period, producing about 2.5 terawatt hours of energy or about 17% of generation. Finally, output from the peaking fleet declined in response to fewer days of extreme weather.
Power is maintaining its forecast of output for 2015 of between 55 and 57 terawatt hours, a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately, 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of this year is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. For 2016, Power has hedged between 50% and 55% of its forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of its forecast generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and 2016 continues to assume volumes hedged under BGS, represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours for each year. We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2015 of $620 million to $680 million. The forecast of operating earnings represents forecast of adjusted EBITDA of $1,545,000,000 to $1,645,000,000 for the full year, which compares to $1,584,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2014. Results for the remainder of the year will be heavily influenced by an increase in the average price of hedged energy and the expected decline in year-over-year capacity revenue. I want to remind you that the average price Power receives for its PJM capacity is expected to remain at 168 megawatt -- $168 per megawatt day for the capacity year, which begins on June 1 of 2015. At the same time, the number of megawatts of capacity for which Power receives revenue in PJM is expected to decline by 1,800 megawatts. And this reflects primarily the retirement of the HEDD units, which we've talked about before. Slide 17 provides more detail on generation in the quarter, and Slide 21 provides detail on Power's hedge position.
Now, let me briefly address the operating results from Enterprise/Other. For the first quarter, PSEG Enterprise/Other reported operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.01 per share last year. The difference in operating income is primarily the result of favorable interest in other income, contribution to income from PSEG-Long Island, and the lease portfolio was steady quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2015 from PSEG Enterprise/Other of $40 million to $45 million. Finally, just a word on the settlement of the Sandy insurance claims. As Ralph mentioned earlier, we're very pleased that we were able to reach a settlement of claims with our insurers for coverage of Superstorm Sandy-related losses. The settlement provides for total recovery of $264 million, an amount that fully compensates PSEG for insurable spending on Sandy-related repairs. PSEG received $50 million of this amount over the 2012, 2013 period, which you probably remember our talking about. Of the remaining $214 million, PSEG recognized $159 million pretax in the first quarter's result under a partial settlement reached with insurers, and we will recognize an additional $54 million pretax in the second quarter. Power's share of the settlement proceeds are not included in operating earnings or adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. As you recall, those expenses when incurred were not included in Power's operating earnings at that time, and this settlement fully closes out the claim related to Sandy.
PSEG closed the quarter with $1 billion of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of March 31, 2015, representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. The level of cash on the balance sheet is high relative to normal conditions, and this reflects the cash impact of bonus depreciation on taxes and includes the receipt of Sandy-related insurance proceeds all -- both occurring, of course, at a time during the year when seasonal influences on demand had a favorable impact on cash balances. We remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity, and we look forward to seeking additional growth investments. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 to $2.95 per share.
So that concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, to open up the line for questions."

And we specifically filed that before PJM's staff recommendation came out because we didn't want it to be viewed as a case of either potentially sour grapes if we didn't win or beating of our chests if we did win. So I think the best face you can put on this is that it's an amazing program that's undergoing some growing pains. I have some broader concerns about it that the success of any market is in the fact that you have multiple buyers and multiple sellers and you have visibility to pricing and the very needs of customers.

The remaining piece of the settlement that we have, the remaining, about $54 million, we have to go through the allocation process, and we will do that and we'll discuss how that will flow when we do the second quarter results. So a couple of things to remember. So on the Power side, we don't flow through operating earnings, that's below the line which you can see in the reconciliation. We don't do that because Power spend was below the line as well. And on the utility side, remember that the recoveries that we got, including a portion of the 50 -- a small portion of that was for PSE&G in past. It goes primarily to balance sheet because a lot of the spend for storm recovery that's recoverable under our policies, capital spend and that's on the balance sheet.

But the base load coal units, Keystone and Conemaugh, had a very strong winter season. Prices weren't -- gas prices were not below that faithful $1.90 number of 2012 that resulted in some of the dispatch of those. And of course, our New Jersey coal units as well as our Connecticut coal units did run a little bit during the winter months because of the unavailability.

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $1.04 per share. That's a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2014's operating earnings of $1.01 per share. PSE&G continues to achieve best-in-class growth, as we expand investments that are helping meet our customers' needs and helping New Jersey achieve important goals. PSE&G invested $599 million in the first quarter as part of its planned capital investment for 2015 of $2.6 billion in upgrades for the electric and gas distribution and transmission systems. PSE&G's capital program is on schedule and on budget. The Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV transmission line is expected to be fully operational later this month. This will be a major achievement. S-R's 2015 operational date is 12 years after the August 2003 blackout and almost a decade after PJM identified the critical system needs required to upgrade aging infrastructure and relieve overloaded power lines. S-R's completion is a testament to the cooperative relationship between PSE&G and PPL Energy and the capabilities shown by PSE&G in navigating the lengthy permitting and licensing process at both the federal and state levels. PSE&G's investment in transmission represented 39% of its year-end 2014 rate base, and it is forecast to grow to represent an excess of 50% of rate base in 5 years. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently approved an expansion of PSE&G's successful energy efficiency programs. The investment of $95 million over the next 3 years will decrease energy costs for participants and lessen the environmental effects of energy supply. At the same time, given the structure of the program, PSE&G should be able to fully earn its authorized return of 9.75%. In addition, the recommendation by PJM staff earlier this week to award PSE&G a share of the work required to upgrade reliability in Artificial Island would increase spending on transmission by anywhere from $100 million to $130 million. The AI investment, the Artificial Island investment, was not included in our capital program as described in our March Investor Conference, so this is an additive to our prior forecasting of utility investment opportunities.
We await the BPU's action later this year on PSE&G's request to invest $1.6 billion over the next 5 years to continue its long-term program to modernize its gas systems. PSE&G's Gas System Modernization Program would support the replacement of approximately 160 miles of cast iron and unprotected field gas mains per year. The replacement program would reduce the risk of leaks, and it would reduce the release of methane gas. PSE&G has been replacing and modernizing its gas pipe as part of the Energy Strong program. Approval of the Gas System Modernization Program would support the extension of this work and continue to provide a direct boost to New Jersey's economy with the creation of more than 500 jobs. We continue to believe that this is the optimal time to move ahead with this work, given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices. Spending on this program would further enhance PSE&G's already strong growth platform. The first quarter results for Power demonstrate the quality of its asset mix. PSE&G's Power's earnings continue to benefit from strong operations and the capable management of its gas supply. The fleet's dispatch flexibility and diverse fuel mix supported operations during this past winter. The gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines fleet availability improved quarter-over-quarter following conclusion of work at Linden in 2014 to increase its capacity and with the continued focus on operations. This improvement and availability aided the fleet's ability to respond to market conditions. And Power continues to benefit from the management of its gas storage and transportation agreements, which also provide substantial savings to PSE&G's residential gas customers. And in the latest development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has granted PJM's request to delay the RPM capacity auction. The delay provides more time for the FERC to consider PJM's proposed changes to the auction structure. We believe PJM's original net CONE offer cap proposal was just and reasonable, but we support PJM's proposal of alternative offer cap, which, if the FERC agrees, would allow for bids up to approximately 85% of net CONE. The FERC's approval of the proposed changes would recognize the need for increased investment to maintain system reliability. The weather conditions experienced over the past 2 years expose the critical need to maintain and improve on the resiliency of our infrastructure, the need to replace aging equipment and maintain the level of service demanded by our customers.
On a separate matter, I'm pleased with the outcome of the settlement we reached with our insurance over claims related to Superstorm Sandy losses. It's been more than 2 years since the storm affected our operations. But in the end, we've been fully compensated for the insurable spending we made on Sandy-related repairs.
Our business model is working the way it should. Operational excellence produces the financial strength that allows us to invest in a disciplined way for growth. Our balance sheet is strong. This financial capability supports our current plans to invest $13 billion for 2019, and it is sufficient to support an expansion of this investment program without the need to issue equity. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth in rate base through 2019, as the earnings contribution from our regulated business exceeds 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG's Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability, as we continue to look for opportunities to expand Power's fleet. The successful implementation of our investment plans will provide PSEG with a strong foundation to deliver customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Based on the strong start to the current year, both operationally and financially, 2015 would represent the third year of growth in PSEG's operating earnings. But given that it is still early in 2015, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 per share to $2.95 per share. We have a proven strategy, and a key contributor to our success is the dedication of our employees to meeting the needs of customers in a safe, reliable manner. Their skills and talent are what will propel us to achieve our long-term goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $1.04 per share versus operating earnings of $1.01 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4. As you can see on Slide 8, PSEG Power provided the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share last year. In addition, Power reported adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared to $651 million last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSEG Enterprise/Other, or the parent, contributed operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and I'll now review each company in a bit more detail.
Let's turn to PSE&G. As shown on Slide 11, PSE&G reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2015 of $0.47 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year. PSE&G's earnings for the first quarter reflect the benefits of the increase in revenue associated with the expansion of its capital program, an increase in demand for gas and the recovery of insurable storm costs from the settlement of Sandy-related insurance claims. PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.6 billion on transmission in 2015 and under PSE&G's formula rate, an increase in transmission revenue of $182 million was effective at the start of the year. This increase in revenue provides for recovery of known costs and appropriate returns associated with PSE&G's expanded transmission investment. The winter weather was significantly colder than normal and colder than a year ago. Of course, the gas weather normalization clause negates the impact of weather on earnings from PSE&G's gas distribution business. However, growth in customer demand for gas normalized for weather added $0.01 per share in earnings. Quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons also benefited from a decline in operation and maintenance expense of $0.01 per share. Decline in O&M reflects the expense portion of PSE&G's share of the Sandy-related insurance settlement and a decline in storm-related repair costs from the higher levels experienced in 2014's first quarter. Together, these more than offset the impact on O&M from an increase in pension expense.
Economic indicators in the service area are modestly better than a year ago. Employment and housing indicators show slow -- show signs of slow but steady improvement. Electric demand has also shown modest improvement, and I stress the word ""modest"" in characterizing demand growth. On a weather-normalized basis, electric sales are estimated to have improved by 0.2% in the quarter, and the improvement was led by a 0.6% growth from the commercial and industrial sector, which offset a decline in demand from residential customers. Gas deliveries, on the other hand, continue to benefit from sustained low commodity prices, and this signals of recovery in the economy.
Weather-normalized gas deliveries in the quarter grew by 0.4% based on a 1% improvement from the residential sector. PSE&G extended bill credits that it had provided for residential gas usage for the prior 5 months through April. The April bill credits cut the average bill for the typical residential customer by 32%. PSE&G received approval from the New Jersey BPU in April of 2015 to increase its investment in energy efficiency. PSE&G will invest an additional $95 million over a 3-year period and an authorized return on equity of 9.75%. The approval will allow PSE&G to expand its energy efficiency initiatives under several popular programs. And the structure under the agreement for revenue and cost recovery should allow PSE&G to fully earn its authorized return. We're maintaining our forecast with PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015 of $735 million to $775 million. PSE&G's earnings for the full year will be driven by the recovery of costs associated with higher levels of capital spending.
Let's now move to PSEG Power. As shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million compared with $0.58 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $651 million for the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance that powers fossil generation facilities. PSEG Power's strong operating results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in availability of its gas-fired combined cycle fleet, higher prices on its hedged energy output and the monetization of its gas supply. Together, these helped offset the impact on earnings from a decline in capacity revenue and lower wholesale market prices for energy. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with an increase in the percent of energy hedged in the first quarter relative to a year ago, fully offset the impact of lower wholesale market prices on earnings. The expected decline in average PJM capacity prices to $168 per megawatt day from $242 per megawatt day last year reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher gas send-out to commercial and industrial customers and strong margins on sales to the off-system market in response to the extreme weather conditions experienced throughout the quarter added $0.04 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings. The absence of a charge in the prior year improved earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. And lastly, earnings comparisons were reduced by $0.01 per share due to an increase in O&M expense. The changes in adjusted EBITDA directly parallel the changes in earnings per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The earnings release on Slide 16 provides you with detailed analysis on the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter from changes in revenue and costs.
Let me now just take a moment to mention our inclusion of adjusted EBITDA, as both new disclosure and new guidance. We know that many of you track one or both, operating earnings and EBITDA, for Power, and we thought that by giving you our EBITDA on the same basis as operating earnings and adjusted for fossil major maintenance expenses, this would give you a better window into Power's cash flow generation potential and value over the long term. We took out major maintenance of our fossil plants as this is a periodic cost versus the ongoing run rate. As I mentioned, the changes in operating earnings align with the changes in adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the reduction in EPS of $0.03 per share associated with lower wholesale energy market prices and slightly higher O&M equates directly to the $25 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA from $651 million in 2014's first quarter to $626 million in this quarter. I plan to talk about adjusted EBITDA every quarter as we go forward to ensure we provide you with a consistent view, as many of you use this for modeling purposes.
Now let's turn for a few minutes to Power's operations. Essentially, this is a tale of 2 winters. As you remember, the past winter was one of the coldest on record and actually colder than 2014's winter. But this past winter was also characterized by improved availability of gas supply and fewer days of extreme weather than the year-ago period, which resulted in dramatically lower wholesale energy prices than a year ago when the market reflected scarcity pricing for a much longer period of time. The decline in wholesale energy prices in the first quarter of 2015 from the first quarter of 2014 affected the financial performance of Power's assets that were open to the market. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges of about $4 per megawatt hour on approximately 76% of generation hedged helped secure Power's margins during the first quarter. The net impact of the higher hedge price was offset somewhat by the need to meet increased demand under load-following contracts at fixed prices. The net impact on profitability of Power's load-following contracts, however, was not as severe as in the year-ago period for the reasons I just mentioned. Once again, Power's ability to monetize its gas supply position offset these market -- energy market impacts, resulting in only a slight decline in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, as I mentioned, to $626 million from last year's $651 million. The flexibility and fuel diversity of Power's fleet supported strong operations in the cold weather conditions experienced in the first quarter. Output of 14.5 terawatt hours was in line with year-ago levels. The nuclear fleet operated an average capacity factor of 95%, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output or 54% of generation. This is just a slight decline from year-ago levels. Production from the combined cycle fleet increased to 3.9 terawatt hours or 27% of generation. This represents a 16% increase in output versus 2014's first quarter. An improvement in the availability at Linden following work to increase the station's capacity and the availability of the Bethlehem, New York facility with an increase in gas supply led to higher production from the combined cycle fleet. The combined cycle fleet's operation was also aided by its use of oil as backup supply to maintain operations during important critical periods. The coal stations performed in line with prior period, producing about 2.5 terawatt hours of energy or about 17% of generation. Finally, output from the peaking fleet declined in response to fewer days of extreme weather.
Power is maintaining its forecast of output for 2015 of between 55 and 57 terawatt hours, a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately, 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of this year is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. For 2016, Power has hedged between 50% and 55% of its forecast production of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 25% to 30% of its forecast generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. The hedge data for 2015 and 2016 continues to assume volumes hedged under BGS, represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours for each year. We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2015 of $620 million to $680 million. The forecast of operating earnings represents forecast of adjusted EBITDA of $1,545,000,000 to $1,645,000,000 for the full year, which compares to $1,584,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2014. Results for the remainder of the year will be heavily influenced by an increase in the average price of hedged energy and the expected decline in year-over-year capacity revenue. I want to remind you that the average price Power receives for its PJM capacity is expected to remain at 168 megawatt -- $168 per megawatt day for the capacity year, which begins on June 1 of 2015. At the same time, the number of megawatts of capacity for which Power receives revenue in PJM is expected to decline by 1,800 megawatts. And this reflects primarily the retirement of the HEDD units, which we've talked about before. Slide 17 provides more detail on generation in the quarter, and Slide 21 provides detail on Power's hedge position.
Now, let me briefly address the operating results from Enterprise/Other. For the first quarter, PSEG Enterprise/Other reported operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.01 per share last year. The difference in operating income is primarily the result of favorable interest in other income, contribution to income from PSEG-Long Island, and the lease portfolio was steady quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2015 from PSEG Enterprise/Other of $40 million to $45 million. Finally, just a word on the settlement of the Sandy insurance claims. As Ralph mentioned earlier, we're very pleased that we were able to reach a settlement of claims with our insurers for coverage of Superstorm Sandy-related losses. The settlement provides for total recovery of $264 million, an amount that fully compensates PSEG for insurable spending on Sandy-related repairs. PSEG received $50 million of this amount over the 2012, 2013 period, which you probably remember our talking about. Of the remaining $214 million, PSEG recognized $159 million pretax in the first quarter's result under a partial settlement reached with insurers, and we will recognize an additional $54 million pretax in the second quarter. Power's share of the settlement proceeds are not included in operating earnings or adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. As you recall, those expenses when incurred were not included in Power's operating earnings at that time, and this settlement fully closes out the claim related to Sandy.
PSEG closed the quarter with $1 billion of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of March 31, 2015, representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. The level of cash on the balance sheet is high relative to normal conditions, and this reflects the cash impact of bonus depreciation on taxes and includes the receipt of Sandy-related insurance proceeds all -- both occurring, of course, at a time during the year when seasonal influences on demand had a favorable impact on cash balances. We remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity, and we look forward to seeking additional growth investments. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.75 to $2.95 per share.
So that concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, to open up the line for questions."

And we specifically filed that before PJM's staff recommendation came out because we didn't want it to be viewed as a case of either potentially sour grapes if we didn't win or beating of our chests if we did win. So I think the best face you can put on this is that it's an amazing program that's undergoing some growing pains. I have some broader concerns about it that the success of any market is in the fact that you have multiple buyers and multiple sellers and you have visibility to pricing and the very needs of customers. And this thing has not had any of those characteristics associated with it, and it's hard for me to imagine that it will be the case when it gets applied nationally, the recharge [ph] deal through their separate rule making.

So a couple of things to remember. So on the Power side, we don't flow through operating earnings, that's below the line which you can see in the reconciliation. We don't do that because Power spend was below the line as well. And on the utility side, remember that the recoveries that we got, including a portion of the 50 -- a small portion of that was for PSE&G in past. It goes primarily to balance sheet because a lot of the spend for storm recovery that's recoverable under our policies, capital spend and that's on the balance sheet.

Prices weren't -- gas prices were not below that faithful $1.90 number of 2012 that resulted in some of the dispatch of those.

The resul",848,"Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 a share, a 16% improvement over the $0.49 per share earned in 2014's second quarter. The results for the quarter bring operating earnings for the first half of 2015 to $1.61 per share, a 7% increase over operating earnings of $1.50 per share earned in 2014's first half. Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail for the results for the quarter and the first half. Our businesses are performing well and meeting the challenges of today's low energy price environment. The results for the quarter and the first half of the year demonstrate the importance of strong operation and provided our customers a safe, reliable low-cost energy. PSE&G invested $1.3 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned capital program for 2015 of $2.6 billion. This included upgrades to the electric and gas distribution and transmission system. PSE&G's focus on improving the resiliency of the grid and increasing operational efficiency is also translated from strong performance in a number of areas of customer satisfaction, including price, billing and payment, corporate citizenship and field service. PSE&G was recently assigned a share of the transmission upgrade work at Artificial Island. PJM's decision would increase PSE&G's decision related capital spending or $100 million to $130 million over the next 4 years. This project will add to PSE&G's robust pipeline of projects that will drive high single digit growth in PSE&G's earnings over the 3-year period ending in 2017. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has begun proceedings related to PSE&G's proposed $1.6 billion Gas System Modernization Program. The investment will provide for continuation of the work underway to replace 800 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe over 5 years to enhance reliability and reduce the potential for harmful emissions of methane gas. Approval would also provide a direct boost to New Jersey's economy. We continue to believe that this is the right time to move forward with this work given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices. PSEG Power's earnings demonstrate the strength of its asset mix. Recent sent economic investments have increased the capacity of existing nuclear and fossil units and have improved the fleet's operating efficiency. The completion of upgrade work at the gas-fired burning combined cycle yield an increase in capacity of 31 megawatts just as of the completion of the first phase of the peach bottom upgrade, which achieved 100% output at the new rate in May provide an additional 65 megawatts for power's share of this nuclear unit. In addition, Power recently announced plans to construct and operate a new 750-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland at a cost of $825 million to $875 million. The investment is in keeping with Power's overall strategy of investing in efficient capacity in its core markets. All 3 investments will enhance Power's ability to perform under PJM's recently approved capacity performance program. Capacity performance, with its emphasis on performance, is an example of how customer demands for reliability are increasing. The size of PSEG Power's fleet, the diversity of the fuel mix and its dispatch flexibility should support performance under the new capacity standards. The real impact of the changes in the RPM capacity option should be felt over time as the market recognizes the need for increased investment to maintain system reliability, particularly in light of item of anomalous weather. We are focused on executing our investment strategies and expanding our infrastructure in a disciplined manner, a manner that supports the goals of customers and shareholders alike. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth in rate base for 2019, as the earnings contribution from our regulated business should continue to exceed 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability as we continue to look for opportunities to expand that fleet. The potential investment in Artificial Island, actually, the recently approved investment in Artificial Island, the announced acquisition of the Keys Energy Center and the gas system modernization program, if approved, would expand our previously announced capital program for 2015 through '19 by 15% to 20% or $2.2 billion. Based on the strength of our results for the first half of the year and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for 2015. We have narrowed our range for guidance for $2.80 to $2.95 per share from its original $2.75 to $2.95 per share. Our financial position remains strong. The growth in capital spending can be financed without the need to issue equity. We intend to utilize our financial strength to pursue investments that enhance operating efficiency, support our market position and seek to improve on the high levels of reliability expected by our customers as we increase shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline, who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 per share versus operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's second quarter. We provide you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4, and we've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 12 provide you with changes in operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. 
So now, I'll review each company in a bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share compared with $0.30 per share for 2014's second quarter, a 10% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14. PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter continued to benefit from expansion of its capital program and the impact of warmer than normal weather on demand. Returns from PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.04 per share to earnings in the quarter. An increase in revenue at the start of the year under its transmission formula rate provides PSE&G the opportunity to continue to earn its allowed return on its transmission investments. Our outlook demand benefited from the more favorable weather conditions during the quarter, that is, the weather was hotter than normal and warmer than last year, as well as the recovery of costs associated with PSE&G's capital infrastructure programs. Together, these improved earnings comparisons in the second quarter by $0.01 per share. [indiscernible] continue to grow in response to sustained low prices. The growth in gas deliveries also increased earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. The improvement in earnings associated with the growth in revenue is partially offset by an increase in pension expense as well as higher storm-related expenses, with those increases totaling an impact of $0.02 per share. An increase in taxes and other items reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share. 
Economic indicators in the service territories such as employment and housing, are showing signs of the improvement. Modest growth in electric demand is reflective of the improvement in economic conditions. On a weather-normalized base, electric sales grew by 0.2% in the quarter and about the same year-to-date. Growth in demand by residential and commercial customers is partially offset by a decline in demand from industrial customers, but weather-normalized deliveries of gas was 2.7% during the first half of the year in response to sustained low prices, something you'll recall we saw last year as well. PSE&G as part of its annual BGSS filing with the New Jersey BPU request a further reduction of $17 million in annual revenues reflecting its lower cost of gas supply. When placed into effect, the BGSS rate will be reduced to $0.40 per firm from $0.45 per firm effective October 1st of this year. And including this reduction, the typical residential gas customer has experienced a reduction in his or her bill of $792 or 47% since January of 2009. PSE&G has maintained a steady level of capital expenditures, investing $1.3 billion in the first half of the year as part of its annual planned capital program of $2.6 billion and upgrades to the electric and gas distribution and transmission systems. The capital investment associated with PSE&G's share of recommended upgrades to the transmission system at Artificial Island will increase the investment in transmission by $100 million to $130 million during the 2016 to 2019 time frame.  So we are updating our forecast for PSE&G's operating earnings for the year from $735 million to $775 million to $760 million to $775 million given year-to-date results. Operating earnings for the full year will be influenced by the summer weather, and of course, the recovery of costs associated with higher levels of capital spending. 
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $0.22 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million, compared with operating earnings of $0.17 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $276 million for the second quarter of 2014. Power's operating results for the second quarter benefited from improved operations at its nuclear and fossil-generating facilities as well as higher prices on its hedged output and a decline in the cost of its gas supply. The benefit to earnings from the improvement in operations more than offset the impact on earnings from an expected decline in capacity revenue and the lower wholesale market prices for energy. Higher average prices on energy hedges, coupled with a reduction in the cost of supply more than offset the impact on earnings of lower wholesale market prices for energy. These items combined to increase quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.10 per share. In addition, a 10% improvement in the output over the prior year increased quarterly earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share. So this improvement in margin was partially offset by the expected decline in PJM capacity revenues, which reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.08 per share. The reduction in capacity revenues reflects the impact both of a lower average capacity price and the retirement of capacity that we've talked about before the capacity that's no longer compliant with environmental regulations. 
Higher levels of O&M and depreciation expense were offset by a decline in taxes of $0.03 per share and other items to net improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately 23% versus last year's 31% was anticipated, and we continue to estimate that the tax rate for the full year will approximate 38% which is about the same rate as you saw in 2014. The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is in line with the changes in earnings per share that I just went through on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
The average price for capacity declined in the quarter to approximately $168 per megawatt day from $217 per megawatt day. In addition, the amount of capacity that cleared the PJM capacity option for the 2015, 2016 capacity year which we've discussed over the past few years was reduced by about 1,800 megawatts to 8,800 megawatts and this reflects the retirement in May of this year of the ATDD peaking capacity that didn't meet New Jersey's nitrous oxide emission standards. As a rule for the second half of 2015, the average price received on PJM capacity will remain stable relative the average price received during the second half of 2014 at about $168 per megawatt day. However, you should continue to expect on a year-over-year basis a decline in capacity revenues during the second half of the year specifically related to that retirement of capacity under ATDD. 
The fuel diversity and flexibility of Power's fleet of generating assets was demonstrated once again in the quarter. Our output increased 10% over year-ago levels to 13.2 terawatt hours. The nuclear fleet operator has an average capacity factor of 86%, producing 7.1 terawatt hours of output or about 54% of our generation. And this level of output represents a 9% improvement from year-ago levels. The performance on the nuclear fleet reflects the absence of some major repairs of [indiscernible] 2014 which led this year's fewer outage related days in the second quarter. 
Production from the combined cycle gas fleet increased 26% this year to 4.6 terawatt hours of generation or 34% of our total generation as the fleet's capacity factor improved to 61%, 49% in the year-ago quarter. Linden's availability improved versus 2014 as the result of up rate and maintenance work that was occurring in the year-ago quarter. This batch of the combined cycle fleet was also supported by the availability of low-cost gas. This batch of the coal fleet however was hurt by a decline in the price of gas and lower wholesale energy prices. Output from the coal fleet declined 1.3 terawatt hours or 10% of generation during the quarter. 
Wholesale market energy prices have been affected by a decline in the price of gas and anomalies in the dispatch of generation associated with the volatility in pricing. Strong production of low-cost gas from Marcellus basin and the lack of sufficient takeaway capacity not unexpectedly has resulted in a lower price for gas. The impact on power prices from the lower cost of gas has further compounded this summer by repair work on electric transmission lines in the Maryland, D.C. area and differentials in load given the warmer than normal weather in Southern PJM versus the more normal demand experienced in the Northern part of PJM. That inability to dispatch energy to meet demands as a result of the transmission constraints hurt the wholesale market price for Power in our region. This situation is alleviated during periods of more normal weather-related demand in the areas served by PSEG Power. So the dynamics affecting the Power markets were not wholly unexpected given that lack of gas transmission takeaway capacity in the Marcellus basin and the work underway to alleviate the constraints on electric transmission to the South of us. Power combined cycle fleet continued to benefit from its access to this low-cost gas supply during the second quarter, and since Power prices held up and we continue to access lower cost gas, the combined cycle fleet experienced an expansion of spark spreads. And Power's fleet will continue to benefit from low gas prices and a somewhat open gas position. 
As we look to the full year, the improvement in availability of Power's gas-fired and nuclear fleet combined with incremental operating capacity at the Peach Bottom 2 nuclear plant and the gas fire Bergen station should allow Power's fleet to produce energy at the upper end of our forecasted output for the year of 55 to 57 terawatt hours. This level of output represents a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the second half of the year is hedged at an average price of $53 per megawatt hour. The average price on Power's energy hedges remains the same, approximately $4 per megawatt hour higher than the average price received on energy hedged during the second half of 2014. 
For 2016 and 2017, Power forecast output will remain stable at approximately 55 to 57 terawatt hours. Of this, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of 2016's forecasted generation at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour and about 30% to 35% of 2017's forecasted level of generation is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. As Rob mentioned, Power has acquired the rights to develop the 755-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle Keys Energy Center in Maryland. The addition of Keys, which represents an investment of approximately $825 million to $875 million was targeted to enter commercial service in 2018. The plant's location we believe will complement Power's fleet and the core market and add to a fleet capable of leading PJM's new capacity performance standards. 
The forecast range of Power's operating earnings for 2015, even with lower wholesale energy prices, remains $620 million to $680 million as guidance, and for adjusted EBITDA, it remains unchanged as well at $1.545 billion to $1.645 billion. Results for the remainder of the year will be influenced by higher average hedge prices, that decline in capacity revenue that I mentioned and wholesale energy market prices. Just a quick note on Enterprise and Other, operating earnings for PSEG Energy Holdings and Enterprise in the second quarter of 2015 were $12 million or $0.02 per share versus operating earnings of $7 million or a rounded $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2014. The improvement in operating income for the second quarter reflects higher earnings from PSEG Long Island, lower O&M expense and higher interest income at the parent. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other of about $40 million to $45 million. 
PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2015, with $597 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing 41.9% of consolidated capital. During the quarter, PSE&G issued $350 million of 10-year secured medium-term notes at an interest rate of 3% and $250 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes added interest rate of 4.05% and we also redeemed $300 million of maturing medium-term notes [indiscernible] to 0.7%. 
As Ralph mentioned, we've updated our forecast for operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share, given strong operating results at both businesses and the first half of the year. Estimates of PSEG Power's adjusted EBITDA remain unchanged at $1.545 billion to $1.645 billion. 
Finally, just on a personal note, as you know, I announced a week ago my plans to retire from PSEG during the fourth quarter. I really enjoyed working with all of you, and as I move on, I know that PSEG has an outstanding management team led by Ralph Izzo, with a strong balance sheet and lots of opportunities to deploy in the future and possesses a really solid foundation for further growth. 
With that, we're now ready for your questions, and I'll turn it back to you, Brandy."

And number three, this went beyond the forecast price risk and including the enrollment of construction risk that we believe ourselves are particularly well-suited to manage given the project work we've done both in Power and in the utility and how well that has all worked out. So for combination of reasons, we were able to see clear to some value creation here that was different from other opportunities with the [indiscernible] people [indiscernible].

This was a painful process, and I'd like to talk it up to the growing pain associated with board of 1000. My concern, I have expressed this to the board at PJM's that we may be heading for a ubiquitous dumbing down of the transmission system as supposed to robust solutions that have advantages over the long-term. The cheapest solution in the short-term may not be the cheapest solution in the long-term and I don't want to do a full-fledged debate over how you make comparisons across your projects. I still believe, based on everything that our engineering team has said, not only do we have a robust solution but we have a lower cost solution. So this is going to be challenging. I think efficient markets work when you have current information available to both suppliers and buyers, and these are technically detailed, painful reviews done by a handful of assessors on the basis of a fairly robust set of bidders. Investment in the limit the transparency, you see it in NYMEX on what is happening in gas markets.

But don't underestimate the significant role played by the location of load and the location of supply in having to design the transmission system. I would contend, although I couldn't prove it to you on this call, that the reason why we've had such a strong need for transmission deployment is the fact that we no longer have an integrated system where utility planners go from generation all the way to the meter and PJM has had to respond to changes in supply both in terms of unexpected retirements and unexpected injunction of new supply. And that results in the need for more robust transmission system and one that you plan from generation to user. Now for Power, we nearly have all this forecast in our fundamental model already. So when we would looked at something like Keys and when we looked at whatever else we might be bidding into RPM, we do scenario analysis that includes diminished demand, as well as a more robust growth. But long winded way of saying it, it's not a single variable model, it's not just what's the demand. It's where is the load, where is the supply and what's happening to the infrastructure that collect what we want."

I'm not a big believer in that thing in eventual outcome because of the connectivity that should be in the last mile, so to speak, and I'm more a believer in the types of things that PJM is advocating which is now the backhaul has to be robust so that people can get on and off, people in the form of power plants can get on and off on that backhaul system.

Remember, last year at about this time, we talk about the fact that we have taken advantage of better pricing last year to put on some incremental hedges. Now hedging doesn't last forever so when we see those opportunities, we layered on hedges as the beneficial prices, so we are contracting to what that benefit's about. The lower cost to serve, obviously, there's lower cost to serve in terms of the wholesale market prices, but also as I mentioned in my remarks, $0.02 of that is our [indiscernible] gas access. So having that access to [indiscernible] gas after the customers at PSE&G have the first call on that access, that contributed to $0.02 a share in this quarter and remember, that's contributed pennies in each quarter of that key quarters in the summer particularly for each of the last 2 years. Now that benefit is one that we've never said we expect to continue in perpetuity, but if you look at the delta of [indiscernible] gas cost relative to Henry Hub, you still see benefit and because we have that access, that's what gives us part of our lower cost to service that [indiscernible] access and we have higher spark spreads, we talked about this last year in summer as well as starting in '13 summer, that our spark spreads for our access to that low-cost gas tended to be about 30% or more higher than the sparks seen in the overall market. So some of the things are hedged position, some things are a little more structural, but together, we think they give us a nice position with the combined cycle fleet that obviously operates very well."

As I have mentioned, as we have done visits with folks I think the debate and the unrest and would do the length of the program and the size, but we went out of our way to file conditions that were identical to what was approved by Energy Strong and that was approved only 14 months ago. Interest rates were exactly where they were then, and return of expectations are exactly where they were then. Right now, my #1 nemesis is summer vacation schedules. So I think we have a couple more [indiscernible] left on the calendar before the fall and we're well on our way to spending of $50 million [ph] for gas that is in Energy Strong that goes to early '16. As you will be able to do that, we have an agreement today we would be able to add a bunch of work in the next couple of weeks, anyway."

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 per share, a 16% improvement over the $0.49 per share earned in 2014's second quarter. The results for the quarter bring operating earnings for the first half of 2015 to $1.61 per share, a 7% increase over operating earnings of $1.50 per share earned in 2014's first half.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on our results for the quarter and the first half. Our businesses are performing well and meeting the challenges of today's low energy price environment. The results for the quarter and first half of the year demonstrate the importance of strong operations in providing our customers with safe, reliable, low-cost energy.
PSE&G invested $1.3 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned capital program for 2015 of $2.6 billion. This included upgrades to the electric and gas distribution and transmission system. PSE&G's focus on improving the resiliency of the grid and increasing operational efficiency is also translated from strong performance in a number of areas of customer satisfaction, including price, billing and payment, corporate citizenship and field service.
PSE&G was recently assigned a share of the transmission upgrade work at Artificial Island. PJM's decision will increase PSE&G's transmission-related capital spending for $100 million to $130 million over the next 4 years. This project will add to PSE&G's robust pipeline of projects that will drive high single-digit growth in PSE&G's earnings over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has begun proceedings related to PSE&G's proposed $1.6 billion Gas System Modernization Program. The investment will provide for continuation of the work underway to replace 800 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe over 5 years to enhance reliability and reduce the potential for harmful emissions of methane gas. Approval would also provide a direct boost to New Jersey's economy. We continue to believe that this is the right time to move forward with this work given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices.
PSEG Power's earnings demonstrate the strength of its asset mix. Recent economic investments have increased the capacity of existing nuclear and fossil units and have improved the fleet's operating efficiency. The completion of uprate work at the gas-fired Bergen combined cycle unit yield an increase in capacity of 31 megawatts just as the completion of the first phase of the Peach Bottom upgrade, which achieved 100% output at the new rate in May provide an additional 65 megawatts for Power's share of this nuclear unit. In addition, Power recently announced plans to construct and operate a new 755-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland at a cost of $825 million to $875 million. The investment is in keeping with Power's overall strategy of investing an efficient capacity in its core markets.
All 3 investments will enhance Power's ability to perform under PJM's recently approved capacity performance program. Capacity performance, with its emphasis on performance, is an example of how customer demands for reliability are increasing. The size of PSEG Power's fleet, the diversity of the fleet's fuel mix and its dispatch flexibility should support performance under the new capacity standards. The real impact of the changes in the RPM capacity auction should be felt over time as the market recognizes the need for increased investment to maintain system reliability, particularly in light of anomalous weather conditions [ph].
We are focused on executing our investment strategies in expanding our infrastructure in a disciplined manner, a manner that supports the goals of customers and shareholders alike. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth in rate base for 2019 as the earnings contribution from our regulated business should continue to exceed 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability as we continue to look for opportunities to expand that fleet. The potential investment in Artificial Island, actually, the recently approved investment in Artificial Island, the announced acquisition of the Keys Energy Center and the Gas System Modernization program, if approved, would expand our previously announced capital program for 2015 through '19 by 15% to 20% or $2.2 billion.
Based on the strength of our results for the first half of the year and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for 2015. We have narrowed our range for guidance to $2.80 to $2.95 per share from its original $2.75 to $2.95 per share.
Our financial position remains strong. The growth in capital spending can be financed without the need to issue equity. We intend to utilize our financial strength to pursue investments that enhance operating efficiency, support our market position and seek to improve on the high levels of reliability expected by our customers as we increase shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 per share versus operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's second quarter. We provide you wit",2220,"Thank you, Ralph, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 per share versus operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's second quarter. We provide you with the reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4, and we've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business; and a similar chart on Slide 12 provides you with changes in operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis.
So now I'll review each company in a bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share compared with $0.30 per share for 2014's second quarter, a 10% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14.
PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter continue to benefit from the expansion of its capital program and the impact of warmer-than-normal weather on demand. Returns from PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.04 per share to earnings in the quarter. An increase in revenue at the start of the year under its transmission formula rate provides PSE&G the opportunity to continue to earn its allowed return on its transmission investments. Electric demand benefited from the more favorable weather conditions during the quarter, that is, the weather was hotter than normal and warmer than last year, as well as the recovery of costs associated with PSE&G's capital infrastructure programs. Together, these improved earnings comparisons in the second quarter by $0.01 per share.
Gas deliveries continue to grow in response to sustained low prices. The growth in gas deliveries also increased earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. The improvement in earnings associated with this growth in revenue is partially offset by an increase in pension expense as well as higher storm-related expenses, with those increases totaling an impact of $0.02 per share.
An increase in taxes and other items reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share.
Economic indicators in the service territory, such as employment and housing, are showing signs of improvement. Modest growth in electric demand is reflective of the improvement in economic conditions. On a weather-normalized base, electric sales grew by 0.2% for the quarter and about the same year-to-date.
Growth in demand by residential and commercial customers is partially offset by a decline in demand from industrial customers, but weather-normalized deliveries of gas was 2.7% during the first half of the year in response to sustained low prices, something you'll recall we saw last year as well.
PSE&G, as part of its annual BGSS filing with the New Jersey BPU, requested a further reduction of $17 million in annual revenues, reflecting its lower cost of gas supply. When placed into effect, the BGSS rate would be reduced to $0.40 per firm from $0.45 per firm effective October 1 of this year. And including this reduction, the typical residential gas customer has experienced a reduction in his or her bill of $792 or 47% since January of 2009. PSE&G has maintained a steady level of capital expenditures, investing $1.3 billion in the first half of the year as part of its annual planned capital program of $2.6 billion and upgrades to the electric and gas distribution and transmission systems. The capital investment associated with PSE&G's share of recommended upgrades to the transmission system at Artificial Island will increase the investment in transmission by $100 million to $130 million during the 2016 to 2019 time frame.
So we are updating our forecast for PSE&G's operating earnings for the year from $735 million to $775 million to $760 million to $775 million given year-to-date results. Operating earnings for the full year will be influenced by the summer weather and, of course, the recovery of costs associated with higher levels of capital spending.
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $0.22 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million compared with operating earnings of $0.17 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $276 million for the second quarter of 2014. Power's operating results for the second quarter benefited from improved operations at its nuclear and fossil-generating facilities as well as higher prices on its hedged output and the decline in the cost of its gas supply. The benefit to earnings from the improvement in operations more than offset the impact on earnings from an expected decline in capacity revenue and the lower wholesale market prices for energy. Higher average prices on energy hedges, coupled with a reduction in the cost of supply, more than offset the impact on earnings of lower wholesale market prices for energy. These items combine to increase quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.10 per share. In addition, a 10% improvement in the output over the prior year increased quarterly earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share. So this improvement in margin was partially offset by the expected decline in PJM capacity revenues, which reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.08 per share. The reduction in capacity revenues reflects the impact both of a lower average capacity price and the retirement of capacity that we've talked about before, the capacity that's no longer compliant with environmental regulations.
Higher levels of O&M and depreciation expense were offset by a decline in taxes of $0.03 per share and other items to net improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately 23% versus last year's 31% was anticipated, and we continue to estimate that the tax rate for the full year will approximate 38%, which is about the same rate as you saw in 2014.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is in line with the changes in earnings per share that I just went through on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
The average price for capacity declined in the quarter to approximately $168 per megawatt day from $217 per megawatt day. In addition, the amount of capacity that cleared the PJM capacity auction for the 2015, 2016 capacity year, which we've discussed over the past few years, was reduced by about 1,800 megawatts to 8,800 megawatts, and this reflects the retirement in May of this year of the ATDD peaking capacity that didn't meet New Jersey's nitrous oxide emission standards. As a rule for the second half of 2015, the average price received on PJM capacity will remain stable relative to the average price received during the second half of 2014 at about $168 per megawatt day. However, you should continue to expect, on a year-over-year basis, a decline in capacity revenues during the second half of the year specifically related to that retirement of capacity under ATDD.
The fuel diversity and flexibility of Power's fleet of generating assets was demonstrated, once again, in the quarter. Our output increased 10% over year ago levels to 13.2 terawatt hours. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86%, producing 7.1 terawatt hours of output or about 54% of our generation. And this level of output represents a 9% improvement from year ago levels. The performance on the nuclear fleet reflects the absence of some major repairs of Salem 2 in 2014, which led this year's fewer outage-related days in the second quarter.
Production from the combined cycle gas fleet increased 26% this year to 4.6 terawatt hours of generation or 34% of our total generation as the fleet's capacity factor improved to 61%, 49% in the year ago quarter. Linden's availability improved versus 2014 as the result of uprate and maintenance work that was occurring in the year ago quarter. This batch of the combined cycle fleet was also supported by the availability of low-cost gas. This batch of the coal fleet, however, was hurt by a decline in the price of gas and lower wholesale energy prices. Output from the coal fleet declined to 1.3 terawatt hours or 10% of generation during the quarter.
Wholesale market energy prices have been affected by a decline in the price of gas and anomalies in the dispatch of generation associated with the volatility in pricing. Strong production of low-cost gas from Marcellus basin and the lack of sufficient takeaway capacity, not unexpectedly, has resulted in a lower price for gas. The impact on Power prices from the lower cost of gas has been further compounded this summer by repair work on electric transmission lines in the Maryland-D.C. area and differentials in load given warmer-than-normal weather in Southern PJM versus the more normal demand experienced in the Northern part of PJM. That inability to dispatch energy to meet demands as a result of the transmission constraints hurt the wholesale market price for Power in our region. This situation is alleviated during periods of more normal weather-related demand in the areas served by PSEG Power. So the dynamics affecting the Power markets were not wholly unexpected given that lack of gas transmission takeaway capacity in the Marcellus basin and the work underway to alleviate the constraints on electric transmission to the South of us. Power combined cycle fleet continue to benefit from its access to this low-cost gas supply during the second quarter. And since Power prices held up and we continue to access lower-cost gas, the combined cycle fleet experienced an expansion of spark spreads. And Power's fleet will continue to benefit from low gas prices and a somewhat open-gas position.
As we look to the full year, the improvement and availability of Power's gas-fired and nuclear fleet, combined with incremental operating capacity at the Peach Bottom 2 nuclear plant and the gas-fired Bergen station, should allow Power's fleet to produce energy at the upper end of our forecasted output for the year of 55 to 57 terawatt hours. This level of output represents a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the second half of the year is hedged at an average price of $53 per megawatt hour. The average price on Power's energy hedges remains the same, approximately $4 per megawatt hour higher than the average price received on energy hedged during the second half of 2014.
For 2016 and 2017, Power forecast output will remain stable at approximately 55 to 57 terawatt hours. Of this, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of 2016's forecasted generation at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour, and about 30% to 35% of 2017's forecasted level of generation is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. As Ralph mentioned, Power has acquired the rights to develop the 755-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle Keys Energy Center in Maryland. The addition of Keys, which represents an investment of approximately $825 million to $875 million was targeted to enter commercial service in 2018. The plant's location, we believe, will complement Power's fleet and the core market and add to a fleet capable of leading PJM's new capacity performance standards.
The forecasted range of Power's operating earnings for 2015, even with lower wholesale energy prices, remains $620 million to $680 million as guidance; and for adjusted EBITDA, it remains unchanged as well at $1.545 billion to $1.645 billion. Results for the remainder of the year will be influenced by higher average hedge prices, that decline in capacity revenue that I mentioned and wholesale energy market prices.
Just a quick note on Enterprise and Other. Operating earnings for PSEG Energy Holdings in Enterprise in the second quarter of 2015 were $12 million or $0.02 per share versus operating earnings of $7 million or a rounded $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2014. The improvement in operating income for the second quarter reflects higher earnings from PSEG-Long Island, lower O&M expense and higher interest income at the parent. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other of about $40 million to $45 million.
PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2015, with $597 million of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of the quarter representing 41.9% of consolidated capital. During the quarter, PSE&G issued $350 million of 10-year secured medium-term notes at an interest rate of 3% and $250 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes at an interest rate of 4.05%, and we also redeemed $300 million of maturing medium-term notes yielding 2.7%.
As Ralph mentioned, we've updated our forecast of operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share given the strong operating results at both businesses in the first half of the year. Estimates of PSEG Power's adjusted EBITDA remain unchanged at $1.545 billion to $1.645 billion.
Finally, just on a personal note, as you know, I announced, a week ago, my plans to retire from PSEG during the fourth quarter. I've really enjoyed working with all of you, and as I move on, I know that PSEG has an outstanding management team, led by Ralph Izzo, with a strong balance sheet and lots of opportunities to deploy in the future and possesses a really solid foundation for further growth.
With that, we're now ready for your questions, and I'll turn it back to you, Brandy."

It's in Southwestern MAAC where we've seen some seasonal basis advantages. Number two, I think we're ahead of the market in terms of the future delivery of gas to that region, which will put a 6,400 unit -- rate unit in a very, very strong competitive position. And number three, this one went beyond the usual forecast of a full price risk and -- including the enrollment of construction risk that we believe ourselves are particularly well suited to manage given the project work we've done both in Power and in the Utility and how well that has all worked out. So for combination of reasons, we were able to see clear to some value creation here that was different from other opportunities with -- can't believe people outbid us. So I think what you hear me saying is that we remain cautious on injecting copious amounts of new supply in the market that's not growing, but this was a very special situation that we felt that fits our portfolio in a nice way."

We'll be able to finance that on Power's balance sheet, and that should operate. So we talk about those balance sheet capacities.

And when this goes in service, it certainly will. So when we looked at Keys, we didn't look at it from the perspective of, ""Well, if we do Keys, we can't do anything else."" We looked at it from a perspective of, ""Keys is a real project. And by no means does it use up a whole of our balance sheet capacity, so we can still continue to look at new opportunities for Power as well.""

My concern, and I've expressed this to FERC and to PJM, is that we may be heading for a ubiquitous dumbing down of the transmission system as supposed to robust solutions that have advantages over the long term. The cheapest solution in the short term may not be the cheapest solution of the long term, and I don't want to get into a full-fledged debate over how you make comparisons across 2 projects. I still believe, based on everything that our engineering team has got listed, not only did we have a more robust solution but we have a lower cost solution. So this is going to be challenging. I think efficient markets work when you have current information available to both suppliers and buyers, and these are technically detailed, painful reviews done by a handful of assessors on the basis of a fairly robust set of bidders. So I think it kind of land itself to the transparency you've seen for NYMEX on what's happening in gas markets. So I don't mean to give a speech, but it's showing some real challenges in terms of we having confidence that, over the long term, Order 1000 will yield a strong transmission system that won't be constantly checking gas in a challenged year in [indiscernible] or a more [indiscernible] over the long term in the field as we had towards the lease cost solutions in terms -- the short-term lease cost solutions."

So I think that PJM is still reviewing its reforecasted loan growth, and of course, loan growth is an important consideration in how one designs your delivery system. But don't underestimate the significant role played by the location of load and the location of supply in having to design the transmission system. I would contend, although I couldn't prove it to you on this call, that the reason why we've had such a strong need for transmission deployment is the fact that we no longer have an integrated system where utility planners go from generation all the way to the meter and PJM has had to respond to changes in supply, both in terms of unexpected retirements and unexpected injunction of new supply. And that results in the need for an even more robust transmission system, that one that you planned from generation to user. Now for Power, we had nearly all of this forecast in our fundamental model already. So when we looked at something like Keys and when we looked at whatever else we might be bidding into RPM, we do scenario analysis that includes diminished demand as well as a more robust growth. But long-winded way of saying it, it's not a single variable model. It's not just what's the demand. It's where is the load, where is the supply and what's happening to the infrastructure that connects what we want."

And I just said we've moved up our hedge a little bit, and the prices are basically the same as where we are. So the hedges proved to be very valuable on a year-over-year basis. Remember, last year at about this time, we talked about the fact that we've taken advantage of some better pricing last year to put on some incremental hedges. Now hedging doesn't last forever, but when we see those opportunities, we've layered on hedges as the beneficial prices, and so recontracting that's kind of what that benefit's about. The lower cost to serve -- obviously, there's lower cost to serve in terms of the wholesale market prices, but also, as I mentioned in my remarks, $0.02 of that is our Leidy gas access. So having that access to Leidy gas after the customers at PSE&G have the first call on that access, that contributed $0.02 a share in this quarter. And you remember, that's contributed pennies each of the -- each quarters of that key quarters in the summer, particularly, for each of the last 2 years. Now that benefit is one that we've never said we expect to continue in perpetuity. But if you look at the delta of Leidy gas cost relative to Henry Hub, you still see benefits. And because we have that access, that's what gives us -- part of our lower cost to serve is that Leidy access, and as I've mentioned, we have higher spark spreads. We've talked about this last year in the summer as well as starting in '13 summer, that our spark spreads or our access to that low-cost gas tended to be about 30% or more higher than the sparks seen in the overall market. So some of the things are hedged position. Some things are a little more structural. But together, we think they give us a nice position with the combined cycle fleet, obviously, that operates very well."

It's encouraging that if we've had them and our hope, really, is that by year end or, at the very latest, early in 2016, we would have this resolved. As you correctly noted, it's something that the state recognizes needs to be done. The interventions in the case are not many nor has there been any surprises. And I think lowering the supply task from 45 to 40 in October just, once again, points out to the level of doing this now. So as I've mentioned, as we've done visits with folks, I think the debate and the arm wrestling will be around the length of the program and the size, but we've -- we went out of our way to file conditions that were identical to what was approved by Energy Strong, and that was approved only 14 months ago. Interest rates are exactly where they were then, and return expectations are exactly where they were then. So right now, my #1 nemesis is summer vacation schedules. So we'll -- I think we have a couple more set of pages left on our calendar for the fall, and we're well on our way to spending at the range $50 million for gas that was in Energy Strong that goes through early '16. So as we wouldn't be able to do that because we had an agreement today, we wouldn't be able to add a bunch of work in the next couple of weeks, anyway."

That's candidly an asymmetric visual [ph] work for relationship [indiscernible]. The downside is the 90% that you put upfront. The upside is the 10% of overperformance. But for somebody like us, the more significant upside is in the units that they'll clear and their ability to back stock in the event that somebody else underperforms within the LDA [ph]. So we never clear 100% of our units, and when we look at our nuclear plants, they have a very low forced outage rates. Our combined cycle is slightly higher but still quite low, and our LM6000s, our peaking units, are also very low forced outage units. So we'll make some incremental investments in some of the units that don't have the same type of operating profile, but I think, really, for us we have not only that sort of even better performance than in the past but probably, more importantly, the fact that we have a bunch of them that don't clear the auction. Some of them were high forced outage rates but will be great insurance policies going forward."

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 per share, a 16% improvement over the $0.49 per share earned in 2014's second quarter. The results for the quarter bring operating earnings for the first half of 2015 to $1.61 per share, a 7% increase over operating earnings of $1.50 per share earned in 2014's first half.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on our results for the quarter and the first half. Our businesses are performing well and meeting the challenges of today's low energy price environment. The results for the quarter and first half of the year demonstrate the importance of strong operations in providing our customers with safe, reliable, low-cost energy.
PSE&G invested $1.3 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned capital program for 2015 of $2.6 billion. This included upgrades to the electric and gas distribution and transmission system. PSE&G's focus on improving the resiliency of the grid and increasing operational efficiency is also translated from strong performance in a number of areas of customer satisfaction, including price, billing and payment, corporate citizenship and field service.
PSE&G was recently assigned a share of the transmission upgrade work at Artificial Island. PJM's decision will increase PSE&G's transmission-related capital spending for $100 million to $130 million over the next 4 years. This project will add to PSE&G's robust pipeline of projects that will drive high single-digit growth in PSE&G's earnings over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has begun proceedings related to PSE&G's proposed $1.6 billion Gas System Modernization Program. The investment will provide for continuation of the work underway to replace 800 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe over 5 years to enhance reliability and reduce the potential for harmful emissions of methane gas. Approval would also provide a direct boost to New Jersey's economy. We continue to believe that this is the right time to move forward with this work given the sizable savings customers continue to realize from low gas prices.
PSEG Power's earnings demonstrate the strength of its asset mix. Recent economic investments have increased the capacity of existing nuclear and fossil units and have improved the fleet's operating efficiency. The completion of uprate work at the gas-fired Bergen combined cycle unit yield an increase in capacity of 31 megawatts just as the completion of the first phase of the Peach Bottom upgrade, which achieved 100% output at the new rate in May provide an additional 65 megawatts for Power's share of this nuclear unit. In addition, Power recently announced plans to construct and operate a new 755-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland at a cost of $825 million to $875 million. The investment is in keeping with Power's overall strategy of investing an efficient capacity in its core markets.
All 3 investments will enhance Power's ability to perform under PJM's recently approved capacity performance program. Capacity performance, with its emphasis on performance, is an example of how customer demands for reliability are increasing. The size of PSEG Power's fleet, the diversity of the fleet's fuel mix and its dispatch flexibility should support performance under the new capacity standards. The real impact of the changes in the RPM capacity auction should be felt over time as the market recognizes the need for increased investment to maintain system reliability, particularly in light of anomalous weather patterns.
We are focused on executing our investment strategies in expanding our infrastructure in a disciplined manner, a manner that supports the goals of customers and shareholders alike. PSE&G's investment program is expected to yield double-digit growth in rate base for 2019 as the earnings contribution from our regulated business should continue to exceed 50% of our consolidated earnings. PSEG Power's investment program is expected to enhance the fleet's efficiency and reliability as we continue to look for opportunities to expand that fleet. The potential investment in Artificial Island, actually, the recently approved investment in Artificial Island, the announced acquisition of the Keys Energy Center and the Gas System Modernization program, if approved, would expand our previously announced capital program for 2015 through '19 by 15% to 20% or $2.2 billion.
Based on the strength of our results for the first half of the year and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for 2015. We have narrowed our range for guidance to $2.80 to $2.95 per share from its original $2.75 to $2.95 per share.
Our financial position remains strong. The growth in capital spending can be financed without the need to issue equity. We intend to utilize our financial strength to pursue investments that enhance operating efficiency, support our market position and seek to improve on the high levels of reliability expected by our customers as we increase shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.57 per share versus operating earnings of $0.49 per share in last year's second quarter. We provide you with the reconciliation of operating earnings to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter on Slide 4, and we've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business; and a similar chart on Slide 12 provides you with changes in operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis.
So now I'll review each company in a bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share compared with $0.30 per share for 2014's second quarter, a 10% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14.
PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter continue to benefit from the expansion of its capital program and the impact of warmer-than-normal weather on demand. Returns from PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.04 per share to earnings in the quarter. An increase in revenue at the start of the year under its transmission formula rate provides PSE&G the opportunity to continue to earn its allowed return on its transmission investments. Electric demand benefited from the more favorable weather conditions during the quarter, that is, the weather was hotter than normal and warmer than last year, as well as the recovery of costs associated with PSE&G's capital infrastructure programs. Together, these improved earnings comparisons in the second quarter by $0.01 per share.
Gas deliveries continue to grow in response to sustained low prices. The growth in gas deliveries also increased earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. The improvement in earnings associated with this growth in revenue is partially offset by an increase in pension expense as well as higher storm-related expenses, with those increases totaling an impact of $0.02 per share.
An increase in taxes and other items reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share.
Economic indicators in the service territory, such as employment and housing, are showing signs of improvement. Modest growth in electric demand is reflective of the improvement in economic conditions. On a weather-normalized base, electric sales grew by 0.2% for the quarter and about the same year-to-date.
Growth in demand by residential and commercial customers is partially offset by a decline in demand from industrial customers, but weather-normalized deliveries of gas was 2.7% during the first half of the year in response to sustained low prices, something you'll recall we saw last year as well.
PSE&G, as part of its annual BGSS filing with the New Jersey BPU, requested a further reduction of $17 million in annual revenues, reflecting its lower cost of gas supply. When placed into effect, the BGSS rate would be reduced to $0.40 per firm from $0.45 per firm effective October 1 of this year. And including this reduction, the typical residential gas customer has experienced a reduction in his or her bill of $792 or 47% since January of 2009. PSE&G has maintained a steady level of capital expenditures, investing $1.3 billion in the first half of the year as part of its annual planned capital program of $2.6 billion and upgrades to the electric and gas distribution and transmission systems. The capital investment associated with PSE&G's share of recommended upgrades to the transmission system at Artificial Island will increase the investment in transmission by $100 million to $130 million during the 2016 to 2019 time frame.
So we are updating our forecast for PSE&G's operating earnings for the year from $735 million to $775 million to $760 million to $775 million given year-to-date results. Operating earnings for the full year will be influenced by the summer weather and, of course, the recovery of costs associated with higher levels of capital spending.
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $0.22 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million compared with operating earnings of $0.17 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $276 million for the second quarter of 2014. Power's operating results for the second quarter benefited from improved operations at its nuclear and fossil-generating facilities as well as higher prices on its hedged output and the decline in the cost of its gas supply. The benefit to earnings from the improvement in operations more than offset the impact on earnings from an expected decline in capacity revenue and the lower wholesale market prices for energy. Higher average prices on energy hedges, coupled with a reduction in the cost of supply, more than offset the impact on earnings of lower wholesale market prices for energy. These items combine to increase quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.10 per share. In addition, a 10% improvement in the output over the prior year increased quarterly earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share. So this improvement in margin was partially offset by the expected decline in PJM capacity revenues, which reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.08 per share. The reduction in capacity revenues reflects the impact both of a lower average capacity price and the retirement of capacity that we've talked about before, the capacity that's no longer compliant with environmental regulations.
Higher levels of O&M and depreciation expense were offset by a decline in taxes of $0.03 per share and other items to net improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.01 per share. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately 23% versus last year's 31% was anticipated, and we continue to estimate that the tax rate for the full year will approximate 38%, which is about the same rate as you saw in 2014.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is in line with the changes in earnings per share that I just went through on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
The average price for capacity declined in the quarter to approximately $168 per megawatt day from $217 per megawatt day. In addition, the amount of capacity that cleared the PJM capacity auction for the 2015, 2016 capacity year, which we've discussed over the past few years, was reduced by about 1,800 megawatts to 8,800 megawatts, and this reflects the retirement in May of this year of the ATDD peaking capacity that didn't meet New Jersey's nitrous oxide emission standards. As a rule for the second half of 2015, the average price received on PJM capacity will remain stable relative to the average price received during the second half of 2014 at about $168 per megawatt day. However, you should continue to expect, on a year-over-year basis, a decline in capacity revenues during the second half of the year specifically related to that retirement of capacity under ATDD.
The fuel diversity and flexibility of Power's fleet of generating assets was demonstrated, once again, in the quarter. Our output increased 10% over year ago levels to 13.2 terawatt hours. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86%, producing 7.1 terawatt hours of output or about 54% of our generation. And this level of output represents a 9% improvement from year ago levels. The performance on the nuclear fleet reflects the absence of some major repairs of Salem 2 in 2014, which led this year's fewer outage-related days in the second quarter.
Production from the combined cycle gas fleet increased 26% this year to 4.6 terawatt hours of generation or 34% of our total generation as the fleet's capacity factor improved to 61%, from 49% in the year ago quarter. Linden's availability improved versus 2014 as the result of uprate and maintenance work that was occurring in the year ago quarter. This batch of the combined cycle fleet was also supported by the availability of low-cost gas. This batch of the coal fleet, however, was hurt by a decline in the price of gas and lower wholesale energy prices. Output from the coal fleet declined to 1.3 terawatt hours or 10% of generation during the quarter.
Wholesale market energy prices have been affected by a decline in the price of gas and anomalies in the dispatch of generation associated with the volatility in pricing. Strong production of low-cost gas from Marcellus basin and the lack of sufficient takeaway capacity, not unexpectedly, has resulted in a lower price for gas. The impact on Power prices from the lower cost of gas has been further compounded this summer by repair work on electric transmission lines in the Maryland-D.C. area and differentials in load given warmer-than-normal weather in Southern PJM versus the more normal demand experienced in the Northern part of PJM. That inability to dispatch energy to meet demands as a result of the transmission constraints hurt the wholesale market price for Power in our region. This situation is alleviated during periods of more normal weather-related demand in the areas served by PSEG Power. So the dynamics affecting the Power markets were not wholly unexpected given that lack of gas transmission takeaway capacity in the Marcellus basin and the work underway to alleviate the constraints on electric transmission to the South of us. Power combined cycle fleet continue to benefit from its access to this low-cost gas supply during the second quarter. And since Power prices held up and we continue to access lower-cost gas, the combined cycle fleet experienced an expansion of spark spreads. And Power's fleet will continue to benefit from low gas prices and a somewhat open-gas position.
As we look to the full year, the improvement and availability of Power's gas-fired and nuclear fleet, combined with incremental operating capacity at the Peach Bottom 2 nuclear plant and the gas-fired Bergen station, should allow Power's fleet to produce energy at the upper end of our forecasted output for the year of 55 to 57 terawatt hours. This level of output represents a 1% to 5% increase over 2014's output of 54.2 terawatt hours. Approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the second half of the year is hedged at an average price of $53 per megawatt hour. The average price on Power's energy hedges remains the same, approximately $4 per megawatt hour higher than the average price received on energy hedged during the second half of 2014.
For 2016 and 2017, Power forecast output will remain stable at approximately 55 to 57 terawatt hours. Of this, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of 2016's forecasted generation at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour, and about 30% to 35% of 2017's forecasted level of generation is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. As Ralph mentioned, Power has acquired the rights to develop the 755-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle Keys Energy Center in Maryland. The addition of Keys, which represents an investment of approximately $825 million to $875 million was targeted to enter commercial service in 2018. The plant's location, we believe, will complement Power's fleet and the core market and add to a fleet capable of leading PJM's new capacity performance standards.
The forecasted range of Power's operating earnings for 2015, even with lower wholesale energy prices, remains $620 million to $680 million as guidance; and for adjusted EBITDA, it remains unchanged as well at $1.545 billion to $1.645 billion. Results for the remainder of the year will be influenced by higher average hedge prices, that decline in capacity revenue that I mentioned and wholesale energy market prices.
Just a quick note on Enterprise and Other. Operating earnings for PSEG Energy Holdings in Enterprise in the second quarter of 2015 were $12 million or $0.02 per share versus operating earnings of $7 million or a rounded $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2014. The improvement in operating income for the second quarter reflects higher earnings from PSEG-Long Island, lower O&M expense and higher interest income at the parent. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other of about $40 million to $45 million.
PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2015, with $597 million of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of the quarter representing 41.9% of consolidated capital. During the quarter, PSE&G issued $350 million of 10-year secured medium-term notes at an interest rate of 3% and $250 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes at an interest rate of 4.05%, and we also redeemed $300 million of maturing medium-term notes yielding 2.7%.
As Ralph mentioned, we've updated our forecast of operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share given the strong operating results at both businesses in the first half of the year. Estimates of PSEG Power's adjusted EBITDA remain unchanged at $1.545 billion to $1.645 billion.
Finally, just on a personal note, as you know, I announced, a week ago, my plans to retire from PSEG during the fourth quarter. I've really enjoyed working with all of you, and as I move on, I know that PSEG has an outstanding management team, led by Ralph Izzo, with a strong balance sheet and lots of opportunities to deploy it in the future and possesses a really solid foundation for further growth.
With that, we're now ready for your questions, and I'll turn it back to you, Brandy."

Number two, I think we're ahead of the market in terms of the future delivery of gas to that region, which will put a 6,400 unit -- rate unit in a very, very strong competitive position. And number three, this one went beyond the usual forecasting of a forward price risk and -- including an element of construction risk that we believe ourselves particularly well suited to manage given the project work we've done both in Power and in the Utility and how well that has all worked out. So for combination of reasons, we were able to see clear to some value creation here that was different from other opportunities where -- can't believe people outbid us. So I think what you hear me saying is that we remain cautious on injecting copious amounts of new supply in the market that's not growing, but this was a very special situation that we felt that fits our portfolio in a nice way."

We'll be able to finance that on Power's balance sheet, and that doesn't use it up, right?. So we talk about those balance sheet capacities.

And when this goes in service, it certainly will. So when we looked at Keys, we didn't look at it from the perspective of, ""Well, if we do Keys, we can't do anything else."" We looked at it from a perspective of, ""Keys is a real good project. And by no means does it use up a whole of our balance sheet capacity, so we can still continue to look at new opportunities for Power as well.""

My concern, and I've expressed this to FERC and to PJM, is that we may be heading for a ubiquitous dumbing down of the transmission system as supposed to robust solutions that have advantages over the long term. The cheapest solution in the short term may not be the cheapest solution of the long term, and I don't want to get into a full-fledged debate over how you make comparisons across 2 projects. I still believe, based on everything that our engineering team has told us that, not only did we have a more robust solution but we have a lower cost solution. So this is going to be challenging. I think efficient markets work when you have current information available to both suppliers and buyers, and these are technically detailed, painful reviews done by a handful of assessors on the basis of a fairly robust set of bidders. So I think it kind of lends itself to the transparency you've seen for NYMEX on what's happening in gas markets. So I don't mean to give a speech, but it's showing some real challenges in terms of we having confidence that, over the long term, Order 1000 will yield a strong transmission system that won't be constantly second guessed or challenged either in courts or a more importantly over the long term in the field as we head towards the lease cost solutions in terms -- the short-term lease cost solutions."

So I think that PJM is still reviewing its reforecasted loan growth, and of course, loan growth is an important consideration in how one designs your delivery system. But don't underestimate the significant role played by the location of load and the location of supply in having to design the transmission system. I would contend, although I couldn't prove it to you on this call, that the reason why we've had such a strong need for transmission deployment is the fact that we no longer have an integrated system where utility planners go from generation all the way to the meter and PJM has had to respond to changes in supply, both in terms of unexpected retirements and unexpected injunction of new supply. And that results in the need for an even more robust transmission system, than one that you can plan from generation to user. Now for Power, we had nearly all of this forecast in our fundamental model already. So when we looked at something like Keys and when we looked at whatever else we might be bidding into RPM, we do scenario analysis that includes diminished demand as well as a more robust growth. But long-winded way of saying it, it's not a single variable model. It's not just what's the demand. It's where is the load, where is the supply and what's happening to the infrastructure that connects what we want."

So yes, remember that when we talk about recontracting as well as lower cost to serve, we gave you that hedging data, right, so we give you all the details on our hedging data. And I just said we've moved up our hedge a little bit, and the prices are basically the same as where we are. So the hedges proved to be very valuable on a year-over-year basis. Remember, last year at about this time, we talked about the fact that we've taken advantage of some better pricing last year to put on some incremental hedges. Now hedging doesn't last forever, but when we see those opportunities, we've layered on hedges as the beneficial prices, and so recontracting that's kind of what that benefit's about. The lower cost to serve -- obviously, there's lower cost to serve in terms of the wholesale market prices, but also, as I mentioned in my remarks, $0.02 of that is our Leidy gas access. So having that access to Leidy gas after the customers at PSE&G have the first call on that access, that contributed $0.02 a share in this quarter. And you remember, that's contributed pennies each of the -- each quarters of that key quarters in the summer, particularly, for each of the last 2 years. Now that benefit is one that we've never said we expect to continue in perpetuity. But if you look at the delta of Leidy gas cost relative to Henry Hub, you still see benefits. And because we have that access, that's what gives us -- part of our lower cost to serve is that Leidy access, and as I've mentioned, we have higher spark spreads. We've talked about this last year in the summer as well as starting in '13 summer, that our spark spreads for our access to that low-cost gas tended to be about 30% or more higher than the sparks seen in the overall market. So some of the things are hedged position. Some things are a little more structural. But together, we think they give us a nice position with the combined cycle fleet, obviously, that operates very well."

As you correctly noted, it's something that the state recognizes needs to be done. The interventions in the case are not many nor has there been any surprises. And I think lowering the supply task from 45 to 40 in October just, once again, points out the wisdom of doing this now. So as I've mentioned, as we've done visits with folks, I think the debate and the arm wrestling will be around the length of the program and the size, but we've -- we went out of our way to file conditions that were identical to what was approved by Energy Strong, and that was approved only 14 months ago. Interest rates are exactly where they were then, and return expectations are exactly where they were then. So right now, my #1 nemesis is summer vacation schedules. So we'll -- I think we have a couple more set of pages left on our calendar for the fall, and we're well on our way to spending at the range $50 million for gas that was in Energy Strong that goes through early '16. So as we wouldn't be able -- even if we had an agreement today, we wouldn't be able to add a bunch of work in the next couple of weeks, anyway."

That's candidly an asymmetric visceral work relationship [indiscernible]. The downside is the 90% that you put upfront. The upside is the 10% of overperformance. But for somebody like us, the more significant upside is in the units that they'll clear and their variability to back stock in the event that somebody else underperforms within the LDA [ph]. So we never clear 100% of our units, and when we look at our nuclear plants, they have a very low forced outage rates. Our combined cycle is slightly higher but still quite low, and our LM6000s, our peaking units, are also very low forced outage units. So we'll make some incremental investments in some of the units that don't have the same type of operating profile, but I think, really, for us we have not only that sort of even better performance than in the past but probably, more importantly, the fact that we have a bunch of units that don't clear the auction.

Earlier this morning, we reported earnings for third quarter 2015 of $0.80 per share. That's a 4% improvement over the $0.77 earned in 2014's third quarter.

That's a 4% improvement over the $0.77 earned in 2014's third quarter. The results for the third quarter bring PSEG's operating earnings for the 9 months ended September to $2.41 per share, which represents a 6% increase over the $2.27 per share earned during the first 9 months of last year. 
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on the results for the third quarter and for the 9 months. 
We delivered solid earnings in the third quarter and year-to-date, and we made excellent progress on our objectives for growing our business. PSE&G continues to deliver on the earnings promise of its expanded capital program, and PSEG Power achieved solid operational and financial results, driven by improved performance from its nuclear and combined cycle fleet. 
During the quarter, PSE&G reached an agreement with the staff of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the New Jersey Division of Council that provides PSE&G to invest $905 million over a 3-year period beginning next year to replace aging and Approval by the BPU later this year will allow PSE&G to continue the work begun under Energy Strong, supporting a clean, safe and reliable gas system well into the future. This agreement follows upon BPU's support earlier this year for a $95 million expansion of PSE&G's investment in energy efficiency programs. PSE&G's focus on improving the resiliency of the grid and increasing operational efficiency has translated once again into PSE&G being recognized as the most reliable utility in the Mid-Atlantic region for the 14th consecutive year. 
PSE&G's responsiveness was also recognized with receipt of the Outstanding Outage Response Time Award for restoring customers 30% faster than any other large investor on utility. But this by no means the end of the infrastructure replacement needs for PSE&G and its customers. 
Turning to PSEG Power, it is increasing its investment in clean, efficient gas-fired capacity. Power cleared a new 540-megawatt combined cycle gas plant at the station as part of the PJM's Reliability Pricing Model-based residual auction. The new unit represents an investment of about $625 million to $675 million, so development of new capacity at is in addition to Power's announced plans to construct and operate a new 755-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland for between $825 million and $875 million. Both units are expected to achieve operational status in 2018. PSEG Power's $1.5 billion investment will expand its gas-fired combined cycle capacity in its score PJM market to approximately 3,800 megawatts as Power's overall gas-fired combined cycle capacity, which includes facilities in New York rose to represent 4,600 megawatts 
PJM's capacity performance initiative under RPM provided the correct incentives for investments. PSEG Power cleared approximately 8,700 megawatts at an average price of $215 per megawatt day. Auction prices reflected the increased risk of nonperformance associated with the auction's new rules. Power adjusted its bidding strategy to reflect this new reality, with an emphasis on availability and reliability undercapacity performance. And we believe Power's fleet is well positioned to perform given its dispatch flexibility, diverse fuel mix and anticipated improvement in efficiency. 
The new paradigm underlying PGM's capacity market is one sign of a more constructive regulatory environment for wholesale-generating assets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking on energy price formation, issued in September, is further recognition that rule changes may be required to appropriately compensate generation for their true cost of operation. 
Our total planned investment program covering PSE&G and Power for the 5-year period ending in 2019 has expanded by 20% since the start of the year, and now totals $15.6 billion. Our investments in PSE&G are expected to improve the resilience of the grid as we replace aging equipment and meet customer needs for reliability. Our investment program is projected to result in annual double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base for the coming 5-year period. Our investment in PSE&G Powers should enhance our market position with improvements in the fleet's efficiency and reliability. In a word, we are executing well on a dynamic market. 
Based on the strength of our results, we are updating our guidance for 2015's operating earnings. We've narrowed our range for guidance as we've increased the lower end. For 2015, we are now forecasting operating earnings of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, which is different from our prior $2.80 to $2.95 per share. 
PSE&G has grown to represent more than half of our operating earnings as Power continues to provide strong free cash flow. We have maintained a disciplined approach to investing in our strong financial position, supports growth without the need to issue equity. We intend to utilize our financial strength to meet the high standards for reliability expected by our customers and enhance the return to required by our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Dan to review our operating results in greater detail."
298482,312859130,887124,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and the good morning, everybody. I'll review our quarterly operating earnings, as well as the outlook for full year results by subsidiary company. As Ralph noted, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 pe",1760,"Thank you, Ralph, and the good morning, everybody. I'll review our quarterly operating earnings, as well as the outlook for full year results by subsidiary company. As Ralph noted, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share versus $0.70 per share in the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months ended September 30, we reported operating earnings of $2.41 per share versus $2.27 per share last year. We provided you a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business and a similar chart on Slide 12 that provides you with the changes in operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in more detail, starting with PSE&G. As shown on Slide 14, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.44 per share compared with $0.39 per share a year ago. PSE&G's earnings in the third quarter reflect the benefit of warmer than normal weather and an increase in revenue associated PSE&G's expanded capital program. The improvement in revenue more than offset a moderate increase in operating expenses. 
Returns from PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings in the quarter. Weather conditions, which were much warmer than normal and warmer than a year ago, provided PSE&G's earnings $0.02 -- improved PSE&G's earnings by $0.02 per share. Earnings comparisons also improved by $0.01 per share due to an increase in electric demand, coupled with revenue recovery and infrastructure-related investment programs. And consistent with the first half of the year, PSE&G experienced an increase in pension expense, resulting in a reduction in the quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. 
Electric sales grew 7% during the quarter as residential customers responded to temperatures, which produced 38% higher temperatures humidity index than levels experience in the year-ago period and 19% higher than normal. And on a weather-normalized basis, electric sales advanced 0.8% in the quarter and 0.4% for the 9 months ended September. Growth for the 9 months period is in line with our long-term expectations for weather-normalized electric sales growth. 
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G reached a settlement principle with a staff of the BPU and the New Jersey Division on the company's Gas System Modernization Program or GSMP. The settlement provides for investment of $905 million over a 3-year period beginning in 2016. And under the settlement, we would invest $650 million in the program at a 9-7-5 return on equity, with the remaining $255 million investment recovered as part of our next base rate case. And you may recall that we agreed, as part of our Energy Strong program, to file a base rate case no later than November 1, 2017. 
PSE&G, with the addition of programs approved and pending, has increased its investment program for the 5-year period ending in 2019 to $11.8 billion. And this represents a 10% increase in PSE&G's capital investment plans since the start of the year and should support estimated annual double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base over this time frame. 
And PSE&G has also filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The update supports PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on an expanded capital base and would increase Transmission revenues in 2016 by $146 million. 
Remember PSE&G's investment in Transmission is expected to grow to about 50% of its rate base by the end of 2019 versus approximately 40% at the end of 2014. We've increased our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015, given strong year-to-date results, and are now forecasting operating earnings of $785 million to $805 million  versus $760 million to $775 million previously. 
Now turning to Power. Power reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $401 million, and that's compared with operating earnings of $0.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA and $386 million for the third quarter of 2014. Power's results for the quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and increase in operation from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet and an improvement in spark spreads, which offset the effect of an expected decline in capacity prices. 
Higher average prices on Energy hedges, coupled with the reduction in the cost of supply, more than offset the impact on earnings of lower wholesale market prices for Energy. And these items combines to increase Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.07 per share. This improvement in margin in the quarter was partially offset by an expected decline in PJM's capacity revenues, which reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. The reduction in capacity revenues reflects the retirement of 1,800 megawatts of older inefficient peaking capacity that was no longer compliant with environmental requirements. The average price received on PJM's capacity in the third quarter was in line with year-ago levels at $186 per megawatt day. 
An increase in OEM expense reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. This increase in operating expenses primarily reflects differences in timing of outages at PSEG Power's nuclear facilities and is not an indicator of a higher embedded level of expenses. 
And lastly, the absence of prior year tax benefits reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. 
As Ralph mentioned, in August, PJM completed the RPM capacity auction for the 2018-2019 year. More than 98% of Power's capacity that cleared the auction met the new capacity performance or CP standards. The price Power will receive per capacity is expected to grow to $215 per megawatt day on average for the capacity year beginning June 1, 2018 from the $168 per megawatt day for the current year. 
And on Slide 28, we have detail on the results of the latest capacity options, including the number of megawatts that cleared the auction, as well as the average price Power expected to receive for its capacity. 
Power cleared a new efficient  commodity cycle at  Seymour and plans to retire a similar amount of older inefficient units at that site. With the results of the latest auction, Power should see growth in its capacity revenues through 2018. 
The generating fleet's operational flexibility continues to be demonstrated during this period of low energy pricing. Improved performance from the nuclear fleet and increased production from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet offset the decline in production at the coal-fired stations. 
Our nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 95% for the quarter, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output, representing 53% of total generation. This also represents a 3% increase in output. Performance of the nuclear facilities benefited from the absence of repair work at Salem 2 in 2014, and showed improvement year-over-year in spite of an early start to the refueling outage at Peach Bottom 3. 
Pressure from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet increased 7% to 5.4 terawatt hours for the quarter, representing 36% of total generation. the fleet operated extremely well, running at an average capacity factor of 73% during the quarter in response to market demand. also benefited from the completion of capacity enhancement work at the Lynden and Burgin stations, which added 94 megawatts to the 2 stations over the past year. 
Warmer than normal summer weather had a favorable impact on the dispatch of our fleet, as dispatch of our coal-fired assets was affected by lower wholesale energy prices. Wholesale market energy prices during the quarter continued to reflect a decline in the price of gas, based on an overabundance of gas supply in the region, strong production of gas from the Marcellus Basin, coupled with insufficient takeaway pipeline capacity, has not unexpectedly resulted in lower prices for gas. Power's combined cycle fleet benefited from its access to low-cost gas supply in the summer and enjoyed strong spark spreads as Power prices held up better than the price of gas. 
Power's fleet is expected to produce energy at the lower end of its forecasted range of output for 2015 of 55 to 57 terawatt hours, reflecting reduced expectations for output from our coal-fired stations. This is slightly less than our prior forecast and would provide a nominal increase in output year-over-year. Approximately 80% to 85% of anticipated production for the fourth quarter is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. 
Moving to 2016, Power has hedged 65% to 70% if outs forecasted generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 35% to 40% of its forecasted generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. The percent of energy hedged in '16 and '17 is consistent with, but at the lower end of the range for, Power's prescribed ratable hedging policy. And the forecast for '16 and '17 continues to assume that 11 to 12 terawatt hours of annual output are hedged to prices. Forecast range for Power's operating earnings for 2015 has been narrowed to $620 million to $650 million from the $620 million to $680 million prior range. This forecast of operating earnings represents adjusted EBITDA for the full year in the range of $1,545 million to $1,595 million. 
Now turning to Enterprise and Other, where we reported operating earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015 versus operating earnings of $22 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And a decline in operating earnings reflects the absence of prior tax benefits at Energy Holdings, partially offset by lower expenses and higher interest income at the parent. 
And the forecast price on Other full year operating earnings for 2015 remains $40 million to $50 million. 
And lastly, relating to financing. PSEG closed the quarter with $271 million of cash in its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. PSEG's 5-year capital program has increased to $15.6 billion, with the announced agreements for PSE&G and Power's plans to develop new capacity. PSE&G's capital program represents 75% of our planned capital expenditures, with Power's capital program representing 25%. And given our strong balance sheet and expectations for Power's free cash flow generation, we're able to finance our capital requirements without the need to issue equity. 
So as I mentioned, we are pleased to update our guidance for 2015's operating earnings to $2.85 to $2.95 per share. And results in this range would represent the third year of growth in operating earnings. And we are now ready for your questions."

And as Dan pointed out right now, we're a little bit lighter than we would typically be hedged in 2017 but still within our normal range, not taking a strong point of view that the market has this all wrong, but you can infer from that, that we think maybe there's a little bit more bearishness in the market than is normally the case."

It is definitely not a strategy shift. We believe that both businesses are quite viable, quite strong and need to be tended in terms their investment and growth opportunities. I think if you got a short enough period of time, you could create whatever strategy you want to from a short enough period of time. But if I just take it back over the last 5 years, PSE&G made up about 80% of the capital program versus Power being 20%. And if I look ahead 5 years, based on what I know today, that 80-20 becomes 75-25. And it's no more than that. so if you think about Power the last 5 years, we spent $400 million upgrading nuclear units, we spent a couple $100 million on peakers, we spent couple hundred million dollars on an advanced gas upgrades. So now we're not doing that. Instead, we're going to take an old steam unit that had 550 megawatts of capacity that really, there was no way it could survive at a CP future and said, okay, instead of just retiring that leaving nothing there and losing the injection rates, let's build a combined cycle because we like the numbers look. And so, instead of upgrading and instead expanding, we're going to build a new natural gas combined cycle unit. As I mentioned before, when I was answering questions, there's some changed going on and basis, we want to know how can you match that better was a big handing that from the investment. But at the same time, we've announced $1 billion in new Utility investments between gas system maintenance, modernization and energy efficiency. And as we pointed out, that gas program at $300 million a year run rate has 30 years ago. We only got 3 years of approval. What we have is 2 very strong businesses, both worthy of investment, both which we look at where we can maximize the benefits for our customers and achieve the return expectations our shareholders. So really, nothing has changed. Absolutely understandable why people would ask question if you just look at the 3-month window all of a sudden you see investing $1.6 billion and Utility is investing $1 billion but I don't think you should look at short windows like that."

So given our capacity prices, given our variable O&M cost, our units are absolutely fine because it would be a finer if gas is $8, and $10 in an BTU, but you well know, so the challenges of the units have had is #1, this and in terms of their ability to spread their fixed cost. And #2, some of the distortions that it created by the tax credit in particular, from wind farms. That's not to minimize the competitive pressures associated with natural gas, but what we're seeing is margin compression and we're nowhere near a point of operating anything but positive margins for those units. So I think that there'll be a period. I don't know how long it will be of competitive pressure on them. But eventually, there's going to be a price on carbon, I don't know if that's going to be on the CPP or some other and these units will be able to arrived in the little bit more difficult trends without any problem and we did benefit from the carbon regime in the future."

So nothing has changed really. We have this sort of 3 tiered prioritization on how to use the balance sheet #1, is reinvesting the business and we've been public about the fact that we will bid combined cycle unit in the upcoming for capacity market in nor ... February. I just mentioned a minute ago that the gas system needs $300 million per year and have a 3-year program. And if you subtract 3 from 5, that means there's 2 years that's unfunded in the plan right now and you may recall, Greg, that when we originally filed for Energy Strong, goodness gracious, 2.5 years ago, we ask for $3.6 million as the first part of the 5-year program and we got $1.2 million approved and it was only put into a 3-year program, so that's halfway done already. And if you take 1.5 of 5, that means 3.5n years of the 5-year program is funded. So there's $1 billion plus in investment opportunity there because it's looking at those 3 Bridge Port Harbor gas and Energy Strong, you're looking at anywhere from $2.5 billion to $3 billion additional investment opportunity that we publicly discussed. Second thing is, so we know base that Utility is a steady grower but we know that Power is in commodities cyclical business and we know how important are to our investors and we've been promising consistent growth in our dividends. So we'd like to make sure that balance sheet has a little bit of an ability to absorb some of the ebbs and flows of the commodity market, so that's the second for us. So and then third, but not one that you would never do but something that we talked about all the time cross to capital is a little out of whack because the balance sheet is a little bit too robust and the investment opportunities are kind of far of the think about share repurchases as a way to get that cost of capital back in line. So that really hasn't changed at all in terms of the 3 tiered prioritization but perhaps maybe a little bit more color on the details."

That's a 4% improvement over the $0.77 earned in 2014's third quarter. The results for the third quarter bring PSEG's operating earnings for the 9 months ended September to $2.41 per share, which represents a 6% increase over the $2.27 per share earned during the first 9 months of last year. 
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on the results for the third quarter and for the 9 months. 
We delivered solid earnings in the third quarter and year-to-date, and we made excellent progress on our objectives for growing our business. PSE&G continues to deliver on the earnings promise of its expanded capital program; and PSEG Power achieved solid operational and financial results, driven by improved performance from its nuclear and combined cycle fleet. 
During the quarter, PSE&G reached an agreement with the staff of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the  New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel that provided for PSE&G to invest $905 million over a 3-year period beginning next year to replace aging cast iron gas mains. Approval by the BPU later this year will allow PSE&G to continue the work begun under Energy Strong, supporting a clean, safe and reliable gas system well into the future. This agreement follows upon BPU's support earlier this year for a $95 million expansion of PSE&G's investment in energy efficiency programs. PSE&G's focus on improving the resiliency of the grid and increasing operational efficiency has translated once again into PSE&G being recognized as the most reliable utility in the Mid-Atlantic region for the 14th consecutive year. 
PSE&G's responsiveness was also recognized with receipt of the Outstanding Outage Response Time Award for restoring customers 30% faster than any other large investor on utility. But this is by no means the end of the infrastructure replacement needs for PSE&G and its customers. 
Turning to PSEG Power, it is increasing its investment in clean, efficient gas-fired capacity. Power cleared a new 540-megawatt combined cycle gas plant at the Sewaren station as part of the PJM's Reliability Pricing Model-based residual auction. The new unit represents an investment of about $625 million to $675 million, so development of new capacity at Sewaren is an addition to Power's announced plans to construct and operate a new 755-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland for between $825 million and $875 million. Both units are expected to achieve operational status in 2018. PSEG Power's $1.5 billion investment will expand its gas-fired combined cycle capacity in its score PJM market to approximately 3,800 megawatts as Power's overall gas-fired combined cycle capacity, which includes; facilities in Bethlehem, New York rose to represent 4,600 megawatts 
PJM's capacity performance initiative under RPM provided the correct incentives for investments. PSEG Power cleared approximately 8,700 megawatts at an average price of $215 per megawatt day. Auction prices reflected the increased risk of nonperformance associated with the auction's new rules. Power adjusted its bidding strategy to reflect this new reality with an emphasis on availability and reliability, under-capacity performance. And we believe Power's fleet is well positioned to perform given its dispatch flexibility, diverse fuel mix and anticipated improvement in efficiency. 
The new paradigm underlying PGM's capacity market is one sign of a more constructive regulatory environment for wholesale-generating assets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking on energy price formation, issued in September, is further recognition that rule changes may be required to appropriately compensate generation for their true cost of operation. 
Our total planned investment program covering PSE&G and Power for the 5-year period ending in 2019 has expanded by 20% since the start of the year and now totals $15.6 billion. Our investments in PSE&G are expected to improve the resilience of the grid as we replace aging equipment and meet customer needs for reliability. Our investment program is projected to result in annual double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base for the coming 5-year period. Our investment in PSE&G Power should enhance our market position with improvements in the fleet's efficiency and reliability. In a word, we are executing well on a dynamic market. 
Based on the strength of our results, we are updating our guidance for 2015's operating earnings. We've narrowed our range for guidance as we've increased the lower end. For 2015, we are now forecasting operating earnings of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, which is different from our prior $2.80 to $2.95 per share. 
PSE&G has grown to represent more than half of our operating earnings as Power continues to provide strong free cash flow. We have maintained a disciplined approach to investing as our strong financial position supports growth without the need to issue equity. We intend to utilize our financial strength to meet the high standards for reliability expected by our customers and enhance the returns required by our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dan to review our operating results in greater detail."
298482,312859130,887391,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. I'll review our quarterly operating earnings as well as the outlook for full year results by subsidiary company. As Ralph noted, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per s",1770,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. I'll review our quarterly operating earnings as well as the outlook for full year results by subsidiary company. 
As Ralph noted, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share versus $0.70 per share in the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months ended September 30, we reported operating earnings of $2.41 per share versus $2.27 per share last year. We provided you a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business and a similar chart on Slide 12 that provides you with the changes in operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in more detail, starting with PSE&G. As shown on Slide 14, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.44 per share compared with $0.39 per share a year ago. PSE&G's earnings in the third quarter reflect the benefit of warmer than normal weather and an increase in revenue associated PSE&G's expanded capital program. Improvement in revenue more than offset a moderate increase in operating expenses. 
Returns from PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings in the quarter. Weather conditions, which were much warmer than normal and warmer than a year ago, provided PSE&G's earnings $0.02 -- improved PSE&G's earnings by $0.02 per share. Earnings comparisons also improved by $0.01 per share due to an increase in electric demand, coupled with revenue recovery and infrastructure-related investment programs. And consistent with the first half of the year, PSE&G experienced an increase in pension expense, resulting in a reduction in the quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. 
Electric sales grew 7% during the third quarter as residential customers responded to temperatures, which produced 38% higher temperatures humidity index than levels experienced in the year-ago period and 19% higher than normal. And on a weather-normalized basis, electric sales advanced 0.008% in the quarter and 0.004% for the 9 months ended September. Growth for the 9 months period is in line with our long-term expectations for weather-normalized electric sales growth. 
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G reached a settlement in principle with the staff of the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel on the company's Gas System Modernization Program or GSMP. The settlement provides for investment of $905 million over a 3-year period beginning in 2016. And under the settlement, we would invest $650 million in the program at a 9 7 5 return on equity, with the remaining $255 million investment recovered as part of our next base rate case. And you may recall that we agreed, as part of our Energy Strong program, to file a base rate case no later than November 1, 2017. 
PSE&G, with the addition of programs approved and pending, has increased its investment program for the 5-year period ending in 2019 to $11.8 billion. And this represents a 10% increase in PSE&G's capital investment plans since the start of the year and should support estimated annual double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base over this time frame. 
And PSE&G has also filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The update supports PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on an expanded capital base and would increase Transmission revenues in 2016 by $146 million. Remember PSE&G's investment in Transmission is expected to grow to about 50% of its rate base by the end of 2019 versus approximately 40% at the end of 2014. We've increased our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015, given strong year-to-date results and are now forecasting operating earnings of $785 million to $805 million versus $760 million to $775 million previously. 
Now turning to Power. Power reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $401 million. And that's compared with operating earnings of $0.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $386 million for the third quarter of 2014. Power's results for the quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and increase in operation from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet and an improvement in spark spreads, which offset the effect of an expected decline in capacity prices. 
Higher average prices on Energy hedges, coupled with the reduction in the cost of supply, more than offset the impact on earnings of lower wholesale market prices for Energy. And these items combined to increase Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.07 per share. This improvement in margin in the quarter was partially offset by an expected decline in PJM's capacity revenues, which reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. The reduction in capacity revenues reflects the retirement of 1,800 megawatts of older inefficient peaking capacity that was no longer compliant with environmental requirements. The average price received on PJM's capacity in the third quarter was in line with year-ago levels at $186 per megawatt day. 
Increase in O&M expense reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. This increase in operating expenses primarily reflects differences in timing of outages at PSEG Power's nuclear facilities and is not an indicator of a higher embedded level of expenses. And lastly, the absence of prior year tax benefits reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. 
As Ralph mentioned, in August, PJM completed the RPM capacity auction for the 2018-2019 year. More than 98% of Power's capacity that cleared the auction met the new capacity performance or CP standards. The price Power will receive per capacity is expected to grow to $215 per megawatt day on average for the capacity year beginning June 1, 2018 from the $168 per megawatt day for the current year. 
And on Slide 28, we have detail on the results for  the latest capacity auction, including the number of megawatts that cleared the auction as well as the average price Power expected to receive for its capacity. 
Power cleared a new efficient commodity cycle unit at Sewaren and plans to retire a similar amount of older inefficient steam units at that site. With the results of the latest auction, Power should see growth in its capacity revenues through 2018. 
The generating fleet's operational flexibility continues to be demonstrated during this period of low energy pricing. Improved performance from the nuclear fleet and increased production from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet offset a decline in production at the coal-fired stations. Our nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 95% for the quarter, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output, representing 53% of total generation. This also represents a 3% increase in output. Performance of the nuclear facilities benefited from the absence of repair work at Salem 2 in 2014 and showed improvement year-over-year in spite of an early start to the refueling outage at Peach Bottom 3. 
Production from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet increased 7% to 5.4 terawatt hours for the quarter, representing 36% of total generation. The fleet operated extremely well, running at an average capacity factor of 73% during the quarter in response to market demand. Output also benefited from the completion of capacity enhancement work at the Linden and Bergen stations, which added 94 megawatts to the 2 stations over the past year. 
Warmer than normal summer weather had a favorable impact on the dispatch of our peaking fleet, as dispatch of our coal-fired assets was affected by lower wholesale energy prices. Wholesale market energy prices during the quarter continued to reflect a decline in the price of gas based on an overabundance of gas supply in the region, strong production of gas from the Marcellus Basin coupled with insufficient takeaway pipeline capacity, has not unexpectedly resulted in lower prices for gas. The Power's combined cycle fleet benefited from its access to low-cost gas supply in the summer and enjoyed strong spark spreads as Power prices held up better than the price of gas. 
Power's fleet is expected to produce energy at the lower end of its forecasted range of output for 2015 of 55 to 57 terawatt hours, reflecting reduced expectations for output from our coal-fired stations. This is slightly less than our prior forecast. We would provide a nominal increase in output year-over-year. Approximately 80% to 85% of anticipated production for the fourth quarter is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. 
Moving to 2016, Power has hedged 65% to 70% of its forecasted generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 35% to 40% of its forecasted generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. The percent of energy hedged in '16 and '17 is consistent with, but at the lower end of the range for Power's prescribed ratable hedging policy. And the forecast for '16 and '17 continues to assume that 11 to 12 terawatt hours of annual output are hedged to BGS prices. Forecast range for Power's operating earnings for 2015 has been narrowed to $620 million to $650 million from the $620 million to $680 million prior range. This forecast of operating earnings represents adjusted EBITDA for the full year in the range of $1,545 million to $1,595 million. 
Now turning to Enterprise and Other, where we reported operating earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015 versus operating earnings of $22 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And a decline in operating earnings reflects the absence of prior tax benefits at Energy Holdings, partially offset by lower expenses and higher interest income at the parent. And the forecast for enterprise and other full year operating earnings for 2015 remains $40 million to $50 million. 
And lastly, relating to financing. PSEG closed the quarter with $271 million of cash on  its balance sheet with debt at the end of the quarter representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. PSEG's 5-year capital program has increased to $15.6 billion with the announced agreements for PSE&G and Power's plans to develop new capacity. PSE&G's capital program represents 75% of our planned capital expenditures, with Power's capital program representing 25%. And given our strong balance sheet and expectations for Power's free cash flow generation, we're able to finance our capital requirements without the need to issue equity. 
So as mentioned, we were pleased to update our guidance for 2015's operating earnings to $2.85 to $2.95 per share. And results in this range would represent the third year of growth in operating earnings. And we are now ready for your questions."

So we don't outguess the market, we have a very clear set of guidelines that we give our trading organization in terms of how much they can hedge and in terms of MAACs and all Minn's all based upon calculations of VAR and gross margins at risk. And we allow them to use their judgment in terms of how market sentiment might be affecting near term prices that may be slightly out of whack with respect to fundamentals, and we allow them to lean a little bit heavier in their hedging as they did last year, which benefited us because prices did come up pretty strong after last winter. And as Dan pointed out right now, we're a little bit lighter than we would typically be hedged in 2017 but still within our normal range, not taking a strong point of view that the market has this all wrong. But you can infer from that, that we think maybe there's a little bit more bearishness in the market than is normally the case."

Thank you for giving us a chance to answer. It is definitely not a strategy shift. We believe that both businesses are quite valuable, quite strong and need to be tended to in terms their investment and growth opportunities. I think if you look at a short enough period of time, you could create whatever strategy you want to from a short enough period of time. But if I just take you back over the last 5 years, PSE&G made up about 80% of the capital program versus Power being 20%. And if I look ahead 5 years, based on what I know today, that 80-20 becomes 75-25. And it's no more than that. So if you think about Power the last 5 years, we spent $400 million operating nuclear units. We spent a couple of $100 million on peakers. We spent a couple of hundred million dollars on advanced gas pass upgrades. So now we're not doing that. Instead, we're going to take an old steam unit that had 550 megawatts of capacity that really, there was no way it could survive in a CP future and said, ""Okay, instead of just retiring that leaving nothing there and losing the injection rights, let's build a combined cycle unit because we like the way those numbers look."" And so instead of operating and instead of expanding, we're going to build a new natural gas combined cycle unit. As I mentioned before, when I was answering Paul's questions, there's some changes going on in basis. We want to know how can we manage that better. We saw a great opportunity in handling that for the Keys investment. But at the same time, we've announced $1 billion in new utility investments between gas system maintenance, modernization and energy efficiency. And as we pointed out, that [indiscernible] monetization program at $300 million a year run rate has 30 years ago. We only got 3 years of approval. What we have is 2 very strong businesses, both worthy of investment, both which we look at where we can maximize the benefits for our customers and achieve the return expectations of our shareholders. So really, nothing has changed. Absolutely understandable why people would ask the question. If you just look at the 3-month window, all of a sudden you see, wow Power's investing $1.6 billion and Utility is investing $1 billion. But I don't think you should look at narrow -- short windows like that."

And I think it's like 0.8% on the gas side. So you just do the arithmetic and the O&M expense outstrips the growth in load.

I think if you look at both fixed and variable O&M, I don't know if we published the operating cost of them, but that's $37 a megawatt hour fixed and variable. If you look at nuclear fuel cost, it's far, far, far less than that. So given our capacity prices, given our variable O&M cost, our units are absolutely fine. They'd be a lot finer if gas is gas was at $8 and $10 in mmBTU. But as you well know, some of the challenges of the units we've had is number one, their size in terms of their ability to spread their fixed cost. And #2, some of the distortions that it created by the production tax credit in particular, from wind farms. That's not to minimize the competitive pressures associated with natural gas. But what we're seeing is margin compression and we're nowhere near a point of operating anything but positive margins for those units. So I think that there'll be a period. I don't know how long that will be of competitive pressure on them. But eventually, there's going to be a price on carbon, I don't know if that's going to be on the CPP or some other paradigm. And these units, we'll be able to arrive through these a little bit more difficult times without any problem and then really benefit from the carbon regime in the future."

We have this sort of 3 tiered prioritization on how to use the balance sheet. Number one is reinvesting in the business. And we've been public about the fact that we will bid -- bridge Port Harbour combined cycle unit in the upcoming for capacity market in New England in February. I just mentioned a minute ago that the gas system needs $300 million per year, and we have a 3-year program. If you subtract 3 from 5, that means there's 2 years that are unfunded in the plan right now. And you may recall, Gregg, that when we originally filed for Energy Strong, goodness gracious, 2.5 years ago, we ask for $3.6 million as the first part of the 5-year program. And we got $1.2 million approved, and it was only put into a 3-year program, so that's halfway done already. And if you take 1.5 of 5, that means 3.5 years of the 5-year program is unfunded. So there's $1 billion plus in investment opportunity there. So just like if those were 3 Bridgeport Harbor gas and Energy Strong, you're looking at anywhere from $2.5 billion to $3 billion of additional investment opportunity that we publicly discussed. Second thing is, look, let's say so we know the Utility's a steady grower but we know that Power is in commodities cyclical business. And we know how important dividends are to our investors. And we've been promising consistent growth in our dividends. So we'd like to make sure that balance sheet has a little bit of an ability to absorb some of the ebbs and flows of the commodity market, so that's a second priority for us. And then third -- but not one that we would never do, but something that we talk about all the time. If our cost of capital is a little out of whack because the balance sheet's a little bit too robust and the investment opportunities are kind of far off, then let's think about share repurchase as a way to get that cost of capital back in line. So that really hasn't changed at all in terms of the 3-tiered prioritization, but perhaps maybe a little bit more color on the details."

Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on the results for the third quarter and for the 9 months. 
We delivered solid earnings in the third quarter and year-to-date, and we made excellent progress on our objectives for growing our business. PSE&G continues to deliver on the earnings promise of its expanded capital program; and PSEG Power achieved solid operational and financial results, driven by improved performance from its nuclear and combined cycle fleet. 
During the quarter, PSE&G reached an agreement with the staff of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel that provided for PSE&G to invest $905 million over a 3-year period beginning next year to replace aging cast iron gas mains. Approval by the BPU later this year will allow PSE&G to continue the work begun under Energy Strong, supporting a clean, safe and reliable gas system well into the future. This agreement follows upon BPU's support earlier this year for a $95 million expansion of PSE&G's investment in energy efficiency programs. PSE&G's focus on improving the resiliency of the grid and increasing operational efficiency has translated once again into PSE&G being recognized as the most reliable utility in the Mid-Atlantic region for the 14th consecutive year. 
PSE&G's responsiveness was also recognized with receipt of the Outstanding Outage Response Time Award for restoring customers 30% faster than any other large investor-owned utility. But this is by no means the end of the infrastructure replacement needs for PSE&G and its customers. 
Turning to PSEG Power, it is increasing its investment in clean, efficient gas-fired capacity. Power cleared a new 540-megawatt combined cycle gas plant at the Sewaren station as part of the PJM's Reliability Pricing Model-based residual auction. The new unit represents an investment of about $625 million to $675 million, so development of new capacity at Sewaren is an addition to Power's announced plans to construct and operate a new 755-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland for between $825 million and $875 million. Both units are expected to achieve operational status in 2018. PSEG Power's $1.5 billion investment will expand its gas-fired combined cycle capacity in its score PJM market to approximately 3,800 megawatts as Power's overall gas-fired combined cycle capacity, which includes; facilities in Bethlehem, New York rose to represent 4,600 megawatts 
PJM's capacity performance initiative under RPM provided the correct incentives for investments. PSEG Power cleared approximately 8,700 megawatts at an average price of $215 per megawatt day. Auction prices reflected the increased risk of nonperformance associated with the auction's new rules. Power adjusted its bidding strategy to reflect this new reality with an emphasis on availability and reliability under capacity performance. And we believe Power's fleet is well positioned to perform given its dispatch flexibility, diverse fuel mix and anticipated improvement in efficiency. 
The new paradigm underlying PGM's capacity market is one sign of a more constructive regulatory environment for wholesale-generating assets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking on energy price formation, issued in September, is further recognition that rule changes may be required to appropriately compensate generation for the true cost of operation. 
Our total planned investment program covering PSE&G and Power for the 5-year period ending in 2019 has expanded by 20% since the start of the year and now totals $15.6 billion. Our investments in PSE&G are expected to improve the resilience of the grid as we replace aging equipment and meet customer needs for reliability. Our investment program is projected to result in annual double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base for the coming 5-year period. Our investment in PSE&G Power should enhance our market position with improvements in the fleet's efficiency and reliability. In a word, we are executing well in a dynamic market. 
Based on the strength of our results, we are updating our guidance for 2015's operating earnings. We've narrowed our range for guidance as we've increased the lower end. For 2015, we are now forecasting operating earnings of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, which is different from our prior $2.80 to $2.95 per share. 
PSE&G has grown to represent more than half of our operating earnings as Power continues to provide strong free cash flow. We have maintained a disciplined approach to investing as our strong financial position supports growth without the need to issue equity. We intend to utilize our financial strength to meet the high standards for reliability expected by our customers and enhance the returns required by our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dan to review our operating results in greater detail."
298482,312859130,887513,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. I'll review our quarterly operating earnings as well as the outlook for full year results by subsidiary company. As Ralph noted, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per s",1769,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. I'll review our quarterly operating earnings as well as the outlook for full year results by subsidiary company. 
As Ralph noted, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share versus $0.70 per share in the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months ended September 30, we reported operating earnings of $2.41 per share versus $2.27 per share last year. We provided you a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business and a similar chart on Slide 12 that provides you with the changes in operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in more detail, starting with PSE&G. As shown on Slide 14, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.44 per share compared with $0.39 per share a year ago. PSE&G's earnings in the third quarter reflect the benefit of warmer than normal weather and an increase in revenue associated PSE&G's expanded capital program. Improvement in revenue more than offset a moderate increase in operating expenses. 
Returns from PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings in the quarter. Weather conditions, which were much warmer than normal and warmer than a year ago, provided PSE&G's earnings $0.02 -- improved PSE&G's earnings by $0.02 per share. Earnings comparisons also improved by $0.01 per share due to an increase in electric demand, coupled with revenue recovery and infrastructure-related investment programs. And consistent with the first half of the year, PSE&G experienced an increase in pension expense, resulting in a reduction in the quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.01 per share. 
Electric sales grew 7% during the third quarter as residential customers responded to temperatures, which produced 38% higher temperatures humidity index than levels experienced in the year-ago period and 19% higher than normal. And on a weather-normalized basis, electric sales advanced 0.008% in the quarter and 0.004% for the 9 months ended September. Growth for the 9 months period is in line with our long-term expectations for weather-normalized electric sales growth. 
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G reached a settlement in principle with the staff of the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel on the company's Gas System Modernization Program or GSMP. The settlement provides for investment of $905 million over a 3-year period beginning in 2016. And under the settlement, we would invest $650 million in the program at a 9 7 5 return on equity, with the remaining $255 million investment recovered as part of our next base rate case. And you may recall that we agreed, as part of our Energy Strong program, to file a base rate case no later than November 1, 2017. 
PSE&G, with the addition of programs approved and pending, has increased its investment program for the 5-year period ending in 2019 to $11.8 billion. And this represents a 10% increase in PSE&G's capital investment plans since the start of the year and should support estimated annual double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base over this time frame. 
And PSE&G has also filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The update supports PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on an expanded capital base and would increase Transmission revenues in 2016 by $146 million. Remember PSE&G's investment in Transmission is expected to grow to about 50% of its rate base by the end of 2019 versus approximately 40% at the end of 2014. We've increased our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2015, given strong year-to-date results and are now forecasting operating earnings of $785 million to $805 million versus $760 million to $775 million previously. 
Now turning to Power. Power reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $401 million. And that's compared with operating earnings of $0.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $386 million for the third quarter of 2014. Power's results for the quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and increase in operation from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet and an improvement in spark spreads, which offset the effect of an expected decline in capacity prices. 
Higher average prices on Energy hedges, coupled with the reduction in the cost of supply, more than offset the impact on earnings of lower wholesale market prices for Energy. And these items combined to increase Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.07 per share. This improvement in margin in the quarter was partially offset by an expected decline in PJM's capacity revenues, which reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. The reduction in capacity revenues reflects the retirement of 1,800 megawatts of older inefficient peaking capacity that was no longer compliant with environmental requirements. The average price received on PJM's capacity in the third quarter was in line with year-ago levels at $186 per megawatt day. 
Increase in O&M expense reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. This increase in operating expenses primarily reflects differences in timing of outages at PSEG Power's nuclear facilities and is not an indicator of a higher embedded level of expenses. And lastly, the absence of prior year tax benefits reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. 
As Ralph mentioned, in August, PJM completed the RPM capacity auction for the 2018-2019 year. More than 98% of Power's capacity that cleared the auction met the new capacity performance or CP standards. The price Power will receive per capacity is expected to grow to $215 per megawatt day on average for the capacity year beginning June 1, 2018 from the $168 per megawatt day for the current year. 
And on Slide 28, we have detail on the results for  the latest capacity auction, including the number of megawatts that cleared the auction as well as the average price Power expects to receive for its capacity. 
Power cleared a new efficient commodity cycle unit at Sewaren and plans to retire a similar amount of older inefficient steam units at that site. With the results of the latest auction, Power should see growth in its capacity revenues through 2018. 
The generating fleet's operational flexibility continues to be demonstrated during this period of low energy pricing. Improved performance from the nuclear fleet and increased production from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet offset a decline in production at the coal-fired stations. Our nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 95% for the quarter, producing 7.8 terawatt hours of output, representing 53% of total generation. This also represents a 3% increase in output. Performance of the nuclear facilities benefited from the absence of repair work at Salem 2 in 2014 and showed improvement year-over-year in spite of an early start to the refueling outage at Peach Bottom 3. 
Production from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet increased 7% to 5.4 terawatt hours for the quarter, representing 36% of total generation. The fleet operated extremely well, running at an average capacity factor of 73% during the quarter in response to market demand. Output also benefited from the completion of capacity enhancement work at the Linden and Bergen stations, which added 94 megawatts to the 2 stations over the past year. 
Warmer than normal summer weather had a favorable impact on the dispatch of our peaking fleet, as dispatch of our coal-fired assets was affected by lower wholesale energy prices. Wholesale market energy prices during the quarter continued to reflect a decline in the price of gas based on an overabundance of gas supply in the region, strong production of gas from the Marcellus Basin coupled with insufficient takeaway pipeline capacity, has not unexpectedly resulted in lower prices for gas. The Power's combined cycle fleet benefited from its access to low-cost gas supply in the summer and enjoyed strong spark spreads as Power prices held up better than the price of gas. 
Power's fleet is expected to produce energy at the lower end of its forecasted range of output for 2015 of 55 to 57 terawatt hours, reflecting reduced expectations for output from our coal-fired stations. This is slightly less than our prior forecast, would provide a nominal increase in output year-over-year. Approximately 80% to 85% of anticipated production for the fourth quarter is hedged at an average price of $52 per megawatt hour. 
Moving to 2016, Power has hedged 65% to 70% of its forecasted generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 35% to 40% of its forecasted generation of 55 to 57 terawatt hours at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. The percent of energy hedged in '16 and '17 is consistent with, but at the lower end of the range for Power's prescribed ratable hedging policy. And the forecast for '16 and '17 continues to assume that 11 to 12 terawatt hours of annual output are hedged to BGS prices. Forecast range for Power's operating earnings for 2015 has been narrowed to $620 million to $650 million from the $620 million to $680 million prior range. This forecast of operating earnings represents adjusted EBITDA for the full year in the range of $1,545 million to $1,595 million. 
Now turning to Enterprise and Other, where we reported operating earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015 versus operating earnings of $22 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And the decline in operating earnings reflects the absence of prior tax benefits at Energy Holdings, partially offset by lower expenses and higher interest income at the parent. And the forecast for enterprise and other full year operating earnings for 2015 remains $40 million to $50 million. 
And lastly, relating to financing. PSEG closed the quarter with $271 million of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of the quarter representing 41.5% of consolidated capital. PSEG's 5-year capital program has increased to $15.6 billion with the announced agreements for PSE&G and Power's plans to develop new capacity. PSE&G's capital program represents 75% of our planned capital expenditures, with Power's capital program representing 25%. And given our strong balance sheet and expectations for Power's free cash flow generation, we're able to finance our capital requirements without the need to issue equity. 
So as mentioned, we were pleased to update our guidance for 2015's operating earnings to $2.85 to $2.95 per share. And results in this range would represent the third year of growth in operating earnings. And we are now ready for your questions."

And as Dan pointed out right now, we're a little bit lighter than we would typically be hedged in 2017 but still within our normal range, not taking a strong point of view that the market has this all wrong. But you can infer from that, that we think maybe there's a little bit more bearishness in the market than is normally the case."

Thank you for giving us a chance to answer. It is definitely not a strategy shift. We believe that both businesses are quite viable, quite strong and need to be tended to in terms their investment and growth opportunities. I think if you look at a short enough period of time, you could create whatever strategy you want to from a short enough period of time. But if I just take you back over the last 5 years, PSE&G made up about 80% of the capital program versus Power being 20%. And if I look ahead 5 years, based on what I know today, that 80-20 becomes 75-25. And it's no more than that. So if you think about Power the last 5 years, we spent $400 million operating nuclear units. We spent a couple of $100 million on peakers. We spent a couple of hundred million dollars on advanced gas pass upgrades. So now we're not doing that. Instead, we're going to take an old steam unit that had 550 megawatts of capacity that really, there was no way it could survive in a CP future and said, ""Okay, instead of just retiring that leaving nothing there and losing the injection rights, let's build a combined cycle unit because we like the way those numbers look."" And so instead of operating and instead of expanding, we're going to build a new natural gas combined cycle unit. As I mentioned before, when I was answering Paul's questions, there's some changes going on in basis. We want to know how can we manage that better. We saw a great opportunity in handling that for the Keys investment. But at the same time, we've announced $1 billion in new utility investments between gas system maintenance, modernization and energy efficiency. And as we pointed out, that gas system monetization program at $300 million a year run rate has 30 years ago. We only got 3 years of approval. So what we have is 2 very strong businesses, both worthy of investment, both which we looked at where we can maximize the benefits for our customers and achieve the return expectations of our shareholders. So really, nothing has changed. Absolutely understandable why people would ask the question. If you just looked at the 3-month window, all of a sudden you see, wow Power's investing $1.6 billion and Utility is investing $1 billion. But I don't think you should look at narrow -- short windows like that."

But even in the best of years, you have labor escalation in our union contracts that are like 2.5%. You just look at sort of management wage growth of 2.5%, 3% and then you look at load growth of -- on a weather-normalized basis of 0.4% on the electric side and I think it's like 0.8% on the gas side. So you just do the arithmetic and the O&M expense outstrips the growth in load. So that bit of a drag peels away at some of the contemporaneous returns that you get from the rate-based growth. So that's why these things don't match perfectly."

I mean it's an excellent question. Each of our units is over 1,000 megawatts. I think if you look at both fixed and variable O&M, I don't know if we published the operating cost of them, but that's $37 a megawatt hour, both fixed and variable.",248,"No, Sophie. I mean it's an excellent question. Each of our units is over 1,000 megawatts. I think if you look at both fixed and variable O&M, I don't know if we published the operating cost of them, but that's $37 a megawatt hour, both fixed and variable. If you look at nuclear fuel cost, it's far, far, far less than that. So given our capacity prices, given our variable O&M cost, our units are absolutely fine. They'd be a lot finer if gas is gas was at $8 and $10 an mmBTU. But as you well know, some of the challenges of the units we've had is; #1, their size in terms of their ability to spread their fixed cost and #2, some of the distortions that it created by the production tax credit in particular, from wind farms. That's not to minimize the competitive pressures associated with natural gas. But what we're seeing is margin compression and we're nowhere near a point of operating anything but positive margins for those units. So I think that there'll be a period. I don't know how long that will be of competitive pressure on them. But eventually, there's going to be a price on carbon. I don't know if that's going to be on the CPP or some other paradigm. And these units will be able to arrive through these little bit more difficult times without any problem and then really benefit from the carbon regime in the future."

We have this sort of 3-tiered prioritization on how to use the balance sheet. Number one is reinvesting in the business. And we've been public about the fact that we will bid Bridgeport Harbor combined cycle unit in the upcoming for capacity market in New England in February. I just mentioned a minute ago that the gas system needs $300 million per year, and we have a 3-year program. If you subtract 3 from 5, that means there's 2 years that are unfunded in the plan right now. And you may recall, Gregg, that when we originally filed for Energy Strong, goodness gracious, 2.5 years ago, we ask for $3.6 million as the first part of the 5-year program. And we got $1.2 million approved, and it was only put into a 3-year program, so that's halfway done already. And if you take 1.5 of 5, that means 3.5 years of the 5-year program is unfunded. So there's $1 billion plus investment opportunity there. So just looking at those 3; Bridgeport Harbor gas and Energy Strong, you're looking at anywhere from $2.5 billion to $3 billion of additional investment opportunity that we publicly discussed. Second thing is, look, let's say so we know the Utility's a steady grower but we know that Power is in commodities cyclical business. And we know how important dividends are to our investors. And we've been promising consistent growth in our dividends. So we'd like to make sure that balance sheet has a little bit of an ability to absorb some of the ebbs and flows of the commodity markets, so that's a second priority for us. And then third -- but not one that we would never do, but something that we talk about all the time. If our cost of capital is a little out of whack because the balance sheet's a little bit too robust and the investment opportunities are kind of far off, then let's think about share repurchase as a way to get that cost of capital back in line. So that really hasn't changed at all in terms of the 3-tiered prioritization, but perhaps maybe a little bit more color on the details."
