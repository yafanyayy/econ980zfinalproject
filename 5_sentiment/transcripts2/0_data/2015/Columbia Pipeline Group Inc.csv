Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have a crisp agenda this morning. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways, Steve will then review our financial results and Glen will share key execution highlights. If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. First and foremost, results were squarely in line with planned. The CPG delivered net operating earnings of about $61 million in the recently completed quarter versus about $59 million in the same period in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $139 million versus about $127 million in 2014. These results just keep a squarely on track to deliver our core commitments, including approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year and a $0.50 annualized dividend at 2x coverage. 
CPG also successfully completed our separation from NiSource on July 1, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CPGX on July 2. This was the combination of a lot of planning and hard work by the team and today CPG is well positioned as premier pure play pipeline midstream in storage company, with a strong core business and highly stable revenue streams and unparalleled strategic footprint in Marcellus and Utica shale place and a visible and transformational growth investment portfolio that will triple the size of the company. Delivering 20% average annual EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our second quarter financial results, highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"

I'm happy to provide an update on CPG solid results for the quarter in a strong financial profile and place for a new stand-alone company. As Bob discussed a few minutes ago, we delivered a strong operating earnings and continued operations and adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP measure. And as such, we remain squarely on track to deliver our core commitments. The quarter and year-to-date numbers were reported are obviously a pre-separation and reflect our capitalization and tax treatment with NiSource. CPG's operating revenues, excluding the impact of trackers were up about $20.7 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed in the service of new firm capacity contracts. We also successfully completed our debt recapitalization process during the quarter, issuing $2.75 billion of long-term investment grade debt with a weighted average term of 11 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. 
On July 2, CPG's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility became effective. As the numbers that test, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available on our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners results. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of $16.3 million or $0.17 per limited common partner unit. CPG is also reported adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $21.3 million and generated distributable cash flow also a non-GAAP measure of $12.5 million for the quarter. CPGL distribution coverage for the year-to-date was 1.09x. On July 30, we announced a cash distribution of $0.1675 per unit to holders of record as of August '13. 
This morning we issued in news release highlighting CPPL's results for the quarter. As you know, the key drivers for the period mirror the key drivers of CPG and our adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our expectations for the quarter. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility with only $20 million currently drawn. These results are squarely in line with CPPL's strategy for delivering unit value to unit holders and remain consistent with our guidance for the year that was presented in our registration statement. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver average long-term annual distribution growth of 20%. 
With that,, I'll hand off 2 Glen to discuss the business highlights"

Across all fronts, the CPG team is continuing to execute against proven plan and a deep-value creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. 
On Slide 6, we highlight our $10 billion-plus investment backlog. While the business development team continues to work towards getting new projects, I would note that the vast majority of the regulated projects listed here are in the execution phase. I'd also note that the projects remained on time and on budget. We're also executing on that third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which as you'll recall is underpinned by the first of its kind FERC-approved customer settlement. 
We expect to invest approximate $300 million under the program during 2015, with great recovery to commence in February of next year. As a reminder, we expect that the modernization program ultimately will undertake a total investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. I'd also point out the discussions are underway with Columbia Transmissions customers regarding the possible extension of the program. We'll provide periodic updates as those discussions progress over the coming months. 
On the midstream side of our business, we remain on schedule with the first phases of the Washington County gathering and big-time expansion projects, which are expected to be placed in service before the end of this year. You may also recall that we have recently announced our Gibraltar project, roughly $275 million investment in a 1 Bcf per day dry gas header system, anchored by a key Marcellus producer. With an estimated and service date for the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe this may be the first phase of a series of projects that collectively could involve an investment of up to $600 million. Of course, the most significant recent news on the growth front shown on Slide 7 is our board approval in late June of the Montenegrin XPress and Gulf XPress projects, which we refer to as MXP and GXP. We're pleased to report that the projects are now in full execution mode, that is we've officially handed MXP and GXP off to a regulatory and project delivery teams to start working on the FDIC filings, public outreach, permitting and ultimately actual construction. 
Together, these 2 projects involve in investment of approximately $2.7 billion and will add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. Planned in service for the projects is the fourth quarter of 2018. And as a significant of these projects are, they represent only a portion of our deep inventory of growth and modernization investments. And I can assure you that the team is working tirelessly to continue to expand our project backlog. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 8 and reiterate and why we believe firmly and the strength of CPG business and this growth trajectory going forward. First, we have got a great core franchise with stable and growing cash flows driven by long-term fee-based contracts with a high-quality diverse customer base. We've got to strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions. We have a robust and highly visible portfolio of growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we have noted on a number of vacations, we expect these projects will result in a tripling CPG's net investment levels by 2020. And to that last point, I would underscore that of our bias definitely is to the upside. And finally as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth, a great combination and we would suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

We have got this pig in the python period from 2016 to 2018, and the latest Gibraltar project just adds to that. And you had an initial plan pre-separation of issuing roughly $4 billion of CPPL equity over time to cover maybe half of the growth CapEx needs. But now we're in the position where we're talking about maybe adding another 3 quarters to $1 billion-plus to the growth CapEx inventory. What I'm trying to get at is when we've done our modeling, you have some rapidly improving credit ratios as these projects come on in late or '18 and in the '19. And adding more equity in those earlier years, given the huge CapEx spend, it doesn't really move the needle a lot. I mena, maybe it makes the rating agencies feel a little better, but these all fee-based stuff, what I'm trying to drive that is do we have to go 50-50 an additional growth projects, do you have flexibility there given how safe and secure your projects are?"

We also understand that we're and you entity in a sense and as we get a track record built up behind us, feel that we have more flexibility from a financing standpoint. So the $4 billion of equity was really more of a modeling assumption to just sort of a balance all that competing interests for both CPPL and CPGX.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have a crisp agenda this morning. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways, Steve will then review our financial results and Glen will share key execution highlights. If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. First and foremost, results were squarely in line with our plan. The CPG team delivered net operating earnings of about $61 million in the recently completed quarter versus about $59 million in the same period in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $139 million versus about $127 million in 2014. These results keep us squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments, including approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year and a $0.50 annualized dividend at 2x coverage. 
CPG also successfully completed our separation from NiSource on July 1, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CPGX on July 2. This was the culmination of a lot of planning and hard work by the team, and today, CPG is well positioned as premier pure-play pipeline midstream and storage company, with a strong core business and highly stable revenue streams, an unparalleled strategic footprint in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays and a visible and transformational growth investment portfolio that will triple the size of the company, delivering 20% average annual EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our second quarter financial results, highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"
273513334,307208085,846611,"Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

I'm happy to provide an update on CPG's solid results for the quarter and the strong financial profile and plays for our new stand-alone company. As Bob discussed a few minutes ago, we delivered strong net operating earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP measure. And as such, we remain squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments. The quarter and year-to-date numbers reported are obviously pre-separation and reflect our capitalization and tax treatment within NiSource. CPG's operating revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $20.7 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed in the service of new firm capacity contracts. We also successfully completed our debt recapitalization process during the quarter, issuing $2.75 billion of long-term investment-grade debt with a weighted average term of 11 years at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. 
On July 2, CPG's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility became effective. As the numbers attest, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available on our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners results. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of $16.3 million or $0.17 per limited common partner unit. CPPL also reported adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $21.3 million and generated distributable cash flow, also a non-GAAP measure, of $12.5 million for the quarter. CPPL's distribution coverage for the year-to-date was 1.09x. On July 30, we announced a cash distribution of $0.1675 per unit to holders of record as of August 13 [ph]. 
This morning we issued a news release highlighting CPPL's results for the quarter. As you know, the key drivers for the period mirror the key drivers of CPG, and our adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our expectations for the quarter. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility with only $20 million currently drawn. These results are squarely in line with CPPL's strategy for delivering value to unitholders and remain consistent with our guidance for the year that was presented in our registration statement. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver average long-term annual distribution growth of 20%. 
With that, I'll hand off to Glen to discuss the business highlights"

Across all fronts, the CPG team is continuing to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. On Slide 6, we highlight our $10 billion-plus investment backlog",654,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning. Across all fronts, the CPG team is continuing to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. 
On Slide 6, we highlight our $10 billion-plus investment backlog. While the business development team continues to work originating new projects, I would note that the vast majority of the regulated projects listed here are in the execution phase. I'd also note that the projects remain on time and on budget. We're also executing on the third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which as you'll recall, is underpinned by a first-of-its-kind, FERC-approved customer settlement. 
We expect to invest approximately $300 million under the program during 2015, with rate recovery to commence in February of next year. As a reminder, we expect that the modernization program ultimately will entail a total investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. I'd also point out that discussions are underway with the Columbia Transmissions customers regarding the possible extension of the program. We'll provide periodic updates as those discussions progress over the coming months. 
On the midstream side of our business, we remain on schedule with the first phases of the Washington County gathering and big-time expansion projects, which are expected to be placed in service before the end of this year. You may also recall that we have recently announced our Gibraltar project, a roughly $275 million investment in a 1 Bcf per day dry gas header system, anchored by a key Marcellus producer, with an estimated and service date for the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe this may be the first phase of a series of projects that collectively could involve an investment of up to $600 million. Of course, the most significant recent news on the growth front, shown on Slide 7, is our board approval in late June of the Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress projects, which we refer to as MXP and GXP. We're pleased to report that the projects are now in full execution mode, that is, we've officially handed MXP and GXP off to our regulatory and project delivery teams to start working on the FERC filings, public outreach, permitting and ultimately, actual construction. 
Together, these 2 projects involve an investment of approximately $2.7 billion and will add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. Planned in service for the projects is at fourth quarter of 2018. And as significant as these projects are, they represent only a portion of our deep inventory of growth and modernization investments, and I can assure you that the team is working tirelessly to continue to expand our project backlog. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 8 and reiterate why we believe so firmly in the strength of the CPG business and its growth trajectory going forward. First, we've got a great core franchise with stable and growing cash flows driven by long-term, fee-based contracts with a high-quality diverse customer base. We've got a strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions. We have a robust and highly visible portfolio of growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we have noted on a number of occasions, we expect these projects will result in a tripling of CPG's net investment level by 2020. And to that last point, I would underscore that our bias definitely is to the upside. And finally as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth, a great combination, and we would suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

There's obviously been disruption in energy. There's been disruption in the midstream sector over the last couple of weeks. I think what's been really telling and it's borne out today as well as the outperformance of CPGX versus CPPL, I think since you guys started trading regular way that GP is outperforming MLP by about 20%. So I'm wondering at what point does it -- or how do guys think about financing? At what point does it make more sense just to finance with CPGX issuance, if the currency of the MLP continues to weaken? If this continues, is there a point at which you might deviate in strategy, if you could just talk to us about that at all?"

And while CPPL has been flat, give or take from where we IPO-ed it, it's still yielding less than 3%. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if anything, we think the outlook for CPPL is even stronger than it was when we IPO-ed. So we appreciate that the market is a bit soft. We think CPPL is still a premium entity with a premium valuation and still viable. And last, but not least, I'd make the point that what we're attempting to finance is highly, highly accretive and it's going to be financed. So we're confident about that. And last thing I would say and I alluded to that in my response to Jeremy, with the liquidity we have and the front-loading of equity, we still have quite a bit of flexibility when we have to come go to the market for equity."

Just technically, we have $500 million revolver in place with the MLP, as you know. We have $1.5 billion revolver in place at CPGX.

We have fixed fee cash flows, very strong growth profile, as Bob mentioned, which has lots of accretive projects associated with it. In fact, all the projects are highly accretive. So there has been dislocation in MLP markets certainly. And I think, over time, we just have to be focused on watching the markets and appropriately accessing the markets when it makes sense. Obviously, the MLP IPO was the primary equity vehicle that we were going to rely on going forward. We continue to believe that, that's the case. Just factually, CPGX can also wish to do equity if it needs to. It's not currently in our plans to do so, but that is also another source of financing. So we feel like we are well positioned to be able to execute on growth projects and that we'll be able to successfully finance those going forward."

But now we're in the position where we're talking about maybe adding another 3 quarters to $1 billion-plus to the growth CapEx inventory. What I'm trying to get at is when we've done our modeling, you have some rapidly improving credit ratios as these projects come on in late '18 and into '19, and adding more equity in those earlier years, given the huge CapEx spend, it doesn't really move the needle a lot. I mean, maybe it makes the rating agencies feel a little better, but these all safe fee-based stuff. What I'm trying to drive at is do we have to go 50-50 on additional growth projects?

And as we get a track record built up behind us, feel that we'll have more flexibility from a financing standpoint. So the $4 billion of equity was really more of a modeling assumption to sort of balance all the competing interests for both CPPL and CPGX.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have a crisp agenda this morning. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways, Steve will then review our financial results and Glen will share key execution highlights. If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. First and foremost, results were squarely in line with our plan. The CPG team delivered net operating earnings of about $61 million in the recently completed quarter versus about $59 million in the same period in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $139 million versus about $127 million in 2014. These results keep us squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments, including approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year and a $0.50 annualized dividend at 2x coverage. 
CPG also successfully completed our separation from NiSource on July 1, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CPGX on July 2. This was the culmination of a lot of planning and hard work by the team, and today, CPG is well positioned as premier pure-play pipeline midstream and storage company, with a strong core business and highly stable revenue streams, an unparalleled strategic footprint in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays and a visible and transformational growth investment portfolio that will triple the size of the company, delivering 20% average annual EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our second quarter financial results, highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"
273513334,307208085,846907,"Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

I'm happy to provide an update on CPG's solid results for the quarter and the strong financial profile in place for our new stand-alone company. As Bob discussed a few minutes ago, we delivered strong net operating earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP measure. And as such, we remain squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments. The quarter and year-to-date numbers reported are obviously pre-separation and reflect our capitalization and tax treatment within NiSource. CPG's operating revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $20.7 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed in the service of new firm capacity contracts. We also successfully completed our debt recapitalization process during the quarter, issuing $2.75 billion of long-term investment-grade debt with a weighted average term of 11 years at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. 
On July 2, CPG's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility became effective. As the numbers attest, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available on our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners results. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of $16.3 million or $0.17 per limited common partner unit. CPPL also reported adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $21.3 million and generated distributable cash flow, also a non-GAAP measure, of $12.5 million for the quarter. CPPL's distribution coverage for the year-to-date was 1.09x. On July 30, we announced a cash distribution of $0.1675 per unit to holders of record as of August 30. 
This morning we issued a news release highlighting CPPL's results for the quarter. As you know, the key drivers for the period mirror the key drivers of CPG, and our adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our expectations for the quarter. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility with only $20 million currently drawn. These results are squarely in line with CPPL's strategy for delivering value to unitholders and remain consistent with our guidance for the year that was presented in our registration statement. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver average long-term annual distribution growth of 20%. 
With that, I'll hand off to Glen to discuss the business highlights"

Across all fronts, the CPG team is continuing to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. On Slide 6, we highlight our $10 billion-plus investment backlog",654,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning. Across all fronts, the CPG team is continuing to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. 
On Slide 6, we highlight our $10 billion-plus investment backlog. While the business development team continues to work originating new projects, I would note that the vast majority of the regulated projects listed here are in the execution phase. I'd also note that the projects remain on time and on budget. We're also executing on the third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which as you'll recall, is underpinned by a first-of-its-kind, FERC-approved customer settlement. 
We expect to invest approximately $300 million under the program during 2015, with rate recovery to commence in February of next year. As a reminder, we expect that the modernization program ultimately will entail a total investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. I'd also point out that discussions are underway with the Columbia Transmissions customers regarding the possible extension of the program. We'll provide periodic updates as those discussions progress over the coming months. 
On the midstream side of our business, we remain on schedule with the first phases of the Washington County gathering and big-time expansion projects, which are expected to be placed in service before the end of this year. You may also recall that we have recently announced our Gibraltar project, a roughly $275 million investment in a 1 Bcf per day dry gas header system, anchored by a key Marcellus producer, with an estimated and service date for the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe this may be the first phase of a series of projects that collectively could involve an investment of up to $600 million. Of course, the most significant recent news on the growth front, shown on Slide 7, is our board approval in late June of the Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress projects, which we refer to as MXP and GXP. We're pleased to report that the projects are now in full execution mode, that is, we've officially handed MXP and GXP off to our regulatory and project delivery teams to start working on the FERC filings, public outreach, permitting and ultimately, actual construction. 
Together, these 2 projects involve an investment of approximately $2.7 billion and will add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. Planned in service for the projects is at fourth quarter of 2018. And as significant as these projects are, they represent only a portion of our deep inventory of growth and modernization investments, and I can assure you that the team is working tirelessly to continue to expand our project backlog. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 8 and reiterate why we believe so firmly in the strength of the CPG business and its growth trajectory going forward. First, we've got a great core franchise with stable and growing cash flows driven by long-term, fee-based contracts with a high-quality diverse customer base. We've got a strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions. We have a robust and highly visible portfolio of growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we have noted on a number of occasions, we expect these projects will result in a tripling of CPG's net investment level by 2020. And to that last point, I would underscore that our bias definitely is to the upside. And finally as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth, a great combination, and we would suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

So there has been dislocation in MLP markets certainly. And I think, over time, we just have to be focused on watching the markets and appropriately accessing the markets when it makes sense. Obviously, the MLP IPO was the primary equity vehicle that we were going to rely on going forward. We continue to believe that, that's the case.

What I'm trying to get at is when we've done our modeling, you have some rapidly improving credit ratios as these projects come on in late '18 and into '19, and adding more equity in those earlier years, given the huge CapEx spend, it doesn't really move the needle a lot. I mean, maybe it makes the rating agencies feel a little better, about this all safe fee-based stuff. What I'm trying to drive at is do we have to go 50-50 on additional growth projects?

So the $4 billion of equity was really more of a modeling assumption to sort of balance all the competing interests for both CPPL and CPGX.

I'll briefly touch on several key statistic takeaways from the quarter. Steve will then review our financial results and Glen, will highlight a number of key execution milestones that the team continues to deliver on. We'll then close with a plenty of time for your questions. 
If you'll return to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online, this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid and squarely in line with our plan. The team delivered net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest of about $69 million in the third quarter versus about $53 million in the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $178 million versus about $126 million in 2014, generating distributable cash flow non-GAAP of approximately $111 million. These results keep us squarely on track to deliver deliver on our core commitments including an approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year. 
The CPG team also continuously hit its marks on the project execution front. First, we placed 3 key growth projects into service. Columbia transmission's eastside expansion and the Columbia Midstream Group's Washington County gathering project and big time expansions. Second, our larger growth projects are advancing on time and on budget through the permitting certificate construction process specifically, the axis, mountaineering express projects achieved significant FERC certification milestones during the quarter. And thirdly, we placed into service nearly $320 million of modernization projects. 
This quarter's performance clearly, demonstrates the CPG team's continuing focus on the flawless execution of our business and growth plan. CPG continues to be a very well-positioned pure play pipeline, midstream, and storage company, with a visible and indeed transformation growth investment portfolio that will deliver 20% annually EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our third quarter financial results, highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"

As Bob discussed, we delivered strong net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow, all non-GAAP. And remains squarely on track to deliver on our financial commitments. 
For the quarter, CPG net operating earnings from continuing operations of $0.22 per share. CPG's operating revenues for the quarter, excluding the impact of trackers increased by about $18 million. Primarily due to the new growth projects placed in the service and new firm capacity contracts. Operating expenses also excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $27 million. Primarily due to a $36 million lease monetization cash gain related to the ongoing optimization of CPG's newer interests, which was included in our May '14 guidance. As well as lower administrative costs, partially offset by increased depreciation outside service costs and other taxes. 
CPG's total liquidity remained strong. A little more than $1.8 billion, as of September 30. Nine-month CapEx on cash basis totaled approximately $833 million. Full details of CPG's results are available in our earnings release and related schedules issued and posted online earlier, this morning.  CPG's year-to-date numbers include preseparation results that reflect our previous capitalization in tax treatment within NiSource. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results, which likewise, were squarely in line with our expectations. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of about $22 million or $0.22 per limited, common partnering unit. CPPL also reported adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP of about $28 million, the generated distributable cash flow also non-GAAP of $21 million for the quarter. CPPL's distribution coverage for the year-to-date period was 1.13x and we expect to maintain average coverage of approximately 1x going forward. 
Third quarter capital expenditures were highlighted by about $364 million of expansion capital, primarily attributable to the express and rain express projects. The Eastside expansion project and Columbia Gas Transmission's system modernization program. Maintenance capital for the quarter totaled roughly $29 million. On November 2, we announced the cash distribution of $0.17.25 per unit to holders of record as of November 13, which is an increase of prior quarters distribution. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million, 5-year revolving credit facility that became effective July 1. Only $20 million of which has been drawn as of September 30, 2015. 
Again, I would reiterate that these results are in line with our expectations and remain consistent with our May '14 guidance. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver annual distribution growth of 20% through 2020, as measured by the distribution paid in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
With that, I'll hand off to Glen to discuss the business highlights. Glen?"

Across all fronts, the CPG team continues to execute against a proven plan and a deep value creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. 
On Slide 6, we highlight our deep investments backlog, the vast majority of which is underpinned by long-term type of pay contracts with our customers. As Bob mentioned, the team continued to advance the ball on several key projects that are listed on this slide. The Eastside expansion was placed on service last month and creates additional capacity for Marcellus Shale supplies to reach growing and capacity constrained Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic market. 
Our Cameron Access Project received it's FERC certificate in September. This is a $310 millin investment that includes enhancements to the existing Columbia Gulf pipeline system as well as the installation of a 26-mile pipeline lateral that will provide direct access to the Cameron LNG export facility. I'd point out that we received the FERC certificate ahead of our original schedule. Also, moving forward is the Mountaineer Express project, which was recently accepted into the FERC's prefiling process. As you recall, MXP is the largest project in our company's history and will provide significant new takeaway capacity from Marcellus and Utica Shale production. To that point, MXP will provide up to 2.7 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. 
Our related project on the Columbia Gulf System, Gulf Express will provide nearly 900 million cubic feet per capacity to Gulf Coast market. Our Columbia Midstream Group also recently placed in service, the initial phases of the Washington County gathering project as well as the big pine expansion. Gibraltar, which is our 1 billion cubic feet per day dry gas header in Southwest Pennsylvania continues to advance and is expected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of next year, with additional follow-on investment opportunities likely. 
During the third quarter CNG also further strengthened the Pennang joint venture, which now includes Williams Partners affiliate 3 Reverse Midstream. This addition will nearly triple the acreage dedicated to the Pennant system to more than 500 acres, and is expected to increase Pennant's infrastructure investment opportunities going forward. 
Finally, the team concluded the third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which is -- we call it underpinned by the first of its kind FERC approved customer settlement. We invested nearly $320 million under the program during 2015 and rate recovery is expected to commence in February of 2016. We've now invested close $1 billion modernizing the Columbia Gas Transmission System and we expect that the program ultimately will entail an investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over 10 to 15 years. I'd also note that the discussions are advancing with our customers and we are encouraged about the prospects for the expansion and extension of the program. We'll provide periodic updates, as those discussions progress over the coming months. Stay tuned. 
On the operations front, I'm pleased to report that our CPG pipeline and storage system as well as our operations and support teams are well-prepared for the coming winter season. As exciting as it is to discuss our portfolio of growth investments and it is, our team fully understands that our #1 priority is safely and reliably deliver gas to our customers every day. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 7 and reiterate, why we believe so firmly in the strength of the CPG business. 
First, we got a great core franchise. With stable and growing cash flows driven by long-term fee-based contracts with a high-quality diverse customer base. We have a strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica Shale production regions. We've got a robust and highly visible portfolio of contracted growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we've noted on a number of occasions, we expect those projects will result in tripling of CPG's net investment level by 2020. And to that last point, I'd underscore that our bias continues to be upside. 
And finally, as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth. A great combination, and we suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As we vis",295,"Thanks, Glen. As you can see, continued solid performance across board. Before we break for questions, let me take a moment to speak for dislocation in the financial markets over the last few months and the impact on CPG and its financing plans. As we visit with investors over the last several months, we've emphasized a number of key points. First, the core fundamentals of our business remained very strong and if anything, we're stronger as the team continues its almost flawless execution on our plan. Second, our financing plan provides us flexibility and latitude. Remember that we effectively over equitized last February, when we raised approximately $1.2 billion in the CPP IPO. I'd also note that, as Steve discussed, CPG's liquidity profile is quite strong with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity as of September 30.  So we don't have to access the equity capital markets until well into 2016.  And last, we although continue to believe over time CPPL represents our most efficient equity raising vehicle, we also have the option to using CPG equity, if we deem appropriate. As you would expect, we continue to closely monitor capital markets and will maintain a thoughtful balanced and disciplined approach in managing our capital needs through the current cycle. At the end of the day, we're very confident that we'll effectively finance the CPG growth portfolio, which I would parenthetically know that it's built the compelling CapEx EBITDA multiple of 5x to 7x. We do our financing in a way that preserves our core financial commitments in both CPG as well as CPPL. 
Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support of Columbia Pipeline Group and Columbia Pipeline Partners. 
With that, Lauren, we're now ready to open the call for questions."

I think your tone has changed a little on this call where you guys have been a little more forthcoming about potentially using CPGX equity. Now the MLP, you guys are reiterating the expectation for 20% growth there. So, to me is that a dropdown is definitely coming, despite of volatility in the market. And if I'm to go by prior guidance, you would need a billion of equity at the MLP in '16. So, I'm under the impression that the public is not really willing to absorb this amount. So when you say that CPGX equity, are you kind of thinking that the parent raise equity at its level and it back stops the billion that the MLP would have to do?"

And our expectation is that, if you look out to 2020 that somewhere in 26 28 bcf of capacity is likely to match reasonably well with where production is expected to be, and that production is already at 20 Bcf a day here at the fourth quarter of 2015. Could there be pocket, could there be time periods where have a mix match between capacity and supply obviously. But we don't regard that as being a systemic kind of scenario that we're likely to face."

I'll briefly touch on several key strategic takeaways from the quarter. Steve will then review our financial results, and Glen will highlight a number of key execution milestones that the team continues to deliver on. We'll then close with plenty of time for your questions. 
If you'll return to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid and squarely in line with our plan. The team delivered net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, of about $69 million in the third quarter versus about $53 million in the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $178 million versus about $126 million in 2014, generating distributable cash flow, non-GAAP, of approximately $111 million. These results keep us squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments, including approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year. 
The CPG team also continuously hit its marks on the project execution front. First, we placed 3 key growth projects into service. Columbia transmission's East Side Expansion and the Columbia Midstream Group's Washington County Gathering project and Big Pine Expansion. Second, our larger growth projects are advancing on time and on budget through the permitting, certificate and construction process. Specifically, the Cameron Access and Mountaineer Xpress projects achieved significant FERC certification milestones during the quarter. And thirdly, we placed into service nearly $320 million of modernization projects. 
This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the CPG team's continuing focus on the flawless execution of our business and growth plans. CPG continues to be a very well-positioned pure-play pipeline, midstream, and storage company, with a visible and, indeed, transformational growth investment portfolio that will deliver 20% average annual EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our third quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"

Let me provide a deeper dive into CPG's results for the quarter and touch on the strong financial profile that supports the modernization and growth investments Glen will be discussing in a few minutes. 
As Bob discussed, we delivered strong net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, all non-GAAP, and remains squarely on track to deliver on our financial commitments. For the quarter, CPG net operating earnings from continuing operations of $0.22 per share. CPG's operating revenues for the quarter, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $18 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. Operating expenses, also excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $27 million, primarily due to a $36 million lease monetization cash gain related to the ongoing optimization of CPG's mineral interests, which was included in our May '14 guidance, as well as lower administrative costs, partially offset by increased depreciation, outside service costs and other taxes. 
CPG's total liquidity remains strong, a little more than $1.8 billion as of September 30. 9-month CapEx on cash basis totaled approximately $833 million. Full details of CPG's results are available in our earnings release and related schedules issued and posted online earlier this morning. CPG's year-to-date numbers include pre-separation results that reflect our previous capitalization and tax treatment within NiSource. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results, which likewise, were squarely in line with our expectations. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of about $22 million or $0.22 per limited common partner unit. CPPL also reported adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP, of about $28 million and generated distributable cash flow, also non-GAAP, of $21 million for the quarter. CPPL's distribution coverage for the year-to-date period was 1.13x and we expect to maintain average coverage of approximately 1x going forward. 
Third quarter capital expenditures were highlighted by about $364 million of expansion capital, primarily attributable to the Leach XPress and Rayne XPress projects, the East Side Expansion project and Columbia Gas Transmission's system modernization program. Maintenance capital for the quarter totaled roughly $29 million. 
On November 2, we announced a cash distribution of $0.1725 per unit to holders of record as of November 13, which is an increase over the prior quarters' distribution. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million, 5-year revolving credit facility that became effective July 1. Only $20 million of which has been drawn as of September 30, 2015. 
Again, I would reiterate that these results are in line with our expectations and remain consistent with our May '14 guidance. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver annual distribution growth of 20% through 2020, as measured by the distribution paid in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
With that, I'll hand off to Glen to discuss the business highlights. Glen?"

Across all fronts, the CPG team continues to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. On Slide 6, we highlight our deep investment backlog, the vast majority of which is underpinned by long-term fixed-fee ""take or pay type"" contracts with our customers. As Bob mentioned, the team continued to advance the ball on several key projects that are listed on this slide. The East Side Expansion was placed in service last month and creates additional capacity for Marcellus Shale supplies to reach growing and capacity-constrained northeastern and mid-Atlantic markets. 
Our Cameron Access Project received its FERC certificate in September. This is a $310 million investment that includes enhancements to the existing Columbia Gulf pipeline system as well as the installation of a 26-mile pipeline lateral that will provide direct access to the Cameron LNG export facility. I'd point out that we received the FERC certificate ahead of our original schedule. 
Also, moving forward is the Mountaineer XPress project, which was recently accepted into the FERC's prefiling process. As you'll recall, MXP is the largest project in our company's history and will provide significant new takeaway capacity for Marcellus and Utica Shale production. To that point, MXP will provide up to 2.7 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. 
Our related project on the Columbia Gulf system, Gulf XPress, will provide nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity to Gulf Coast market. Our Columbia Midstream Group also recently placed in service, the initial phases of the Washington County Gathering project as well as the Big Pine Expansion. Gibraltar, which is our 1 billion cubic feet per day dry gas header in southwest Pennsylvania, continues to advance and is expected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of next year, with additional follow-on investment opportunities likely. 
During the third quarter, CMG also further strengthened the Pennant Joint Venture, which now includes Williams Partners affiliate, Three Rivers Midstream. This addition will nearly triple the acreage dedicated to the Pennant system to more than 500,000 acres and is expected to increase Pennant's infrastructure investment opportunities going forward. 
Finally, the team concluded the third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which as you'll recall, is underpinned by a ""first of its kind"" FERC-approved customer settlement. We invested nearly $320 million under the program during 2015, and rate recovery is expected to commence in February of 2016. We've now invested close $1 billion modernizing the Columbia Gas Transmission system and we expect that the program ultimately will entail an investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over 10 to 15 years. I'd also note that the discussions are advancing with our customers, and we're encouraged about the prospects for the extension and expansion of the program. We'll provide periodic updates as those discussions progress over the coming months. Stay tuned. 
On the operations front, I'm pleased to report that our CPG pipeline and storage system as well as our operations and support teams are well prepared for the coming winter season. As exciting as it is to discuss our portfolio of growth investments, and it is, our team fully understands that our #1 priority is to safely and reliably deliver gas to our customers every day. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 7 and reiterate why we believe so firmly in the strength of the CPG business. First, we've got a great core franchise with stable and growing cash flows, driven by long-term, fee-based contracts with a high-quality, diverse customer base. We have a strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica Shale production regions. We've got a robust and highly visible portfolio of contracted growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we've noted on a number of occasions, we expect those projects will result in a tripling of CPG's net investment level by 2020. And to that last point, I'd underscore that our bias continues to be to the upside. And finally, as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth, a great combination, and we suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As",297,"Thanks, Glen. As you can see, continued solid performance across board. Before we break for questions, let me take a moment to speak to the dislocation in the financial markets over the last few months, and the impact on CPG and its financing plans. 
As we visit with investors over the last several months, we've emphasized a number of key points. First, the core fundamentals of our business remain very strong and, if anything, we're stronger as the team continues its almost flawless execution of our plan. 
Second, our financing plan provides us flexibility and latitude. Remember that we effectively over-equitized last February when we raised approximately $1.2 billion in the CPP IPO. I'd also note that as Steve discussed, CPG's liquidity profile is quite strong, with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity as of September 30. So we don't have to access the equity capital markets until well into 2016. 
And last, although we continue to believe that over time, CPPL represents our most efficient equity-raising vehicle, we also have the option of using CPG equity if we deem it appropriate. As you would expect, we'll continue to closely monitor the capital markets and we'll maintain a thoughtful, balanced and disciplined approach to managing our capital needs through the current cycle. 
At the end of the day, we're very confident that we'll effectively finance the CPG growth portfolio, which I would parenthetically note is built at a compelling CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple of 5 to 7x. And we do our financing in a way that preserves our core financial commitments at both CPG as well as CPPL. 
Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of Columbia Pipeline Group and Columbia Pipeline Partners. With that, Lauren, we're now ready to open the call to questions."

And if I'm to go by prior guidance, you would need $1 billion of equity at the MLP in '16. So I'm under the impression that the public is not really willing to absorb this amount. So when you say that CPGX equity, are you kind of thinking that the parent raise equity at its level and it backs up the $1 billion that the MLP would have to do?"

We believe that some folks that make that point often double count some of the capacity that is in the process of being built or probably don't handicap very aggressively some projects that may not get built. And our expectation is, if you look out to 2020, that somewhere in the 26, 28 bcf of capacity is likely to match reasonably well with where production is expected to be. And that production is already at 20 Bcf a day here at the fourth quarter of 2015. Could there be pockets? Could there be time periods where have a mismatch between capacity and the supply?

I'll briefly touch on several key strategic takeaways from the quarter. Steve will then review our financial results, and Glen will highlight a number of key execution milestones that the team continues to deliver on. We'll then close with plenty of time for your questions. 
If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid and squarely in line with our plan. The team delivered net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, of about $69 million in the third quarter versus about $53 million in the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $178 million versus about $126 million in 2014, generating distributable cash flow, non-GAAP, of approximately $111 million. These results keep us squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments, including approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year. 
The CPG team also continues to hit its marks on the project execution front. First, we placed 3 key growth projects into service. Columbia transmission's East Side Expansion and the Columbia Midstream Group's Washington County Gathering project and Big Pine Expansion. Second, our larger growth projects are advancing on time and on budget through the permitting, certificate and construction process. Specifically, the Cameron Access and Mountaineer Xpress projects achieved significant FERC certification milestones during the quarter. And thirdly, we placed into service nearly $320 million of modernization projects. 
This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the CPG team's continuing focus on the flawless execution of our business and growth plans. CPG continues to be a very well-positioned pure-play pipeline, midstream, and storage company, with a visible and, indeed, transformational growth investment portfolio that will deliver 20% average annual EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our third quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"

Let me provide a deeper dive into CPG's results for the quarter and touch on the strong financial profile that supports the modernization and growth investments Glen will be discussing in a few minutes. 
As Bob discussed, we delivered strong net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, all non-GAAP, and remains squarely on track to deliver on our financial commitments. For the quarter, CPG net operating earnings from continuing operations of $0.22 per share. CPG's operating revenues for the quarter, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $18 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. Operating expenses, also excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $27 million, primarily due to a $36 million lease monetization cash gain related to the ongoing optimization of CPG's mineral interests, which was included in our May '14 guidance, as well as lower administrative costs, partially offset by increased depreciation, outside service costs and other taxes. 
CPG's total liquidity remains strong, a little more than $1.8 billion as of September 30. 9-month CapEx on cash basis totaled approximately $833 million. Full details of CPG's results are available in our earnings release and related schedules issued and posted online earlier this morning. CPG's year-to-date numbers include pre-separation results that reflect our previous capitalization and tax treatment within NiSource. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results, which likewise, were squarely in line with our expectations. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of about $22 million or $0.22 per limited common partner unit. CPPL also reported adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP, of about $28 million and generated distributable cash flow, also non-GAAP, of $21 million for the quarter. CPPL's distribution coverage for the year-to-date period was 1.13x and we expect to maintain average coverage of approximately 1x going forward. 
Third quarter capital expenditures were highlighted by about $364 million of expansion capital, primarily attributable to the Leach XPress and Rayne XPress projects, the East Side Expansion project and Columbia Gas Transmission's system modernization program. Maintenance capital for the quarter totaled roughly $29 million. 
On November 2, we announced a cash distribution of $0.1725 per unit to holders of record as of November 13, which is an increase over the prior quarters' distribution. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million, 5-year revolving credit facility that became effective July 1. Only $20 million of which has been drawn as of September 30, 2015. 
Again, I would reiterate that these results are in line with our expectations and remain consistent with our May '14 guidance. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver annual distribution growth of 20% through 2020, as measured by the distribution paid in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
With that, I'll hand off to Glen to discuss the business highlights. Glen?"

Across all fronts, the CPG team continues to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. On Slide 6, we highlight our deep investment backlog, the vast majority of which is underpinned by long-term fixed-fee ""take or pay type"" contracts with our customers. As Bob mentioned, the team continued to advance the ball on several key projects that are listed on this slide. The East Side Expansion was placed in service last month and creates additional capacity for Marcellus Shale supplies to reach growing and capacity-constrained northeastern and mid-Atlantic markets. 
Our Cameron Access Project received its FERC certificate in September. This is a $310 million investment that includes enhancements to the existing Columbia Gulf pipeline system as well as the installation of a 26-mile pipeline lateral that will provide direct access to the Cameron LNG export facility. I'd point out that we received the FERC certificate ahead of our original schedule. 
Also, moving forward is the Mountaineer XPress project, which was recently accepted into the FERC's prefiling process. As you'll recall, MXP is the largest project in our company's history and will provide significant new takeaway capacity for Marcellus and Utica Shale production. To that point, MXP will provide up to 2.7 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. 
Our related project on the Columbia Gulf system, Gulf XPress, will provide nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity to Gulf Coast market. Our Columbia Midstream Group also recently placed in service, the initial phases of the Washington County Gathering project as well as the Big Pine Expansion. Gibraltar, which is our 1 billion cubic feet per day dry gas header in southwest Pennsylvania, continues to advance and is expected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of next year, with additional follow-on investment opportunities likely. 
During the third quarter, CMG also further strengthened the Pennant Joint Venture, which now includes Williams Partners affiliate, Three Rivers Midstream. This addition will nearly triple the acreage dedicated to the Pennant system to more than 500,000 acres and is expected to increase Pennant's infrastructure investment opportunities going forward. 
Finally, the team concluded the third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which as you'll recall, is underpinned by a ""first of its kind"" FERC-approved customer settlement. We invested nearly $320 million under the program during 2015, and rate recovery is expected to commence in February of 2016. We've now invested close $1 billion modernizing the Columbia Gas Transmission system and we expect that the program ultimately will entail an investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over 10 to 15 years. I'd also note that the discussions are advancing with our customers, and we're encouraged about the prospects for the extension and expansion of the program. We'll provide periodic updates as those discussions progress over the coming months. Stay tuned. 
On the operations front, I'm pleased to report that our CPG pipeline and storage system as well as our operations and support teams are well prepared for the coming winter season. As exciting as it is to discuss our portfolio of growth investments, and it is, our team fully understands that our #1 priority is to safely and reliably deliver gas to our customers every day. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 7 and reiterate why we believe so firmly in the strength of the CPG business. First, we've got a great core franchise with stable and growing cash flows, driven by long-term, fee-based contracts with a high-quality, diverse customer base. We have a strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica Shale production regions. We've got a robust and highly visible portfolio of contracted growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we've noted on a number of occasions, we expect those projects will result in a tripling of CPG's net investment level by 2020. And to that last point, I'd underscore that our bias continues to be to the upside. And finally, as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth, a great combination, and we suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As",297,"Thanks, Glen. As you can see, continued solid performance across board. Before we break for questions, let me take a moment to speak to the dislocation in the financial markets over the last few months, and the impact on CPG and its financing plans. 
As we visit with investors over the last several months, we've emphasized a number of key points. First, the core fundamentals of our business remain very strong and, if anything, we're stronger as the team continues its almost flawless execution of our plan. 
Second, our financing plan provides us flexibility and latitude. Remember that we effectively over-equitized last February when we raised approximately $1.2 billion in the CPP IPO. I'd also note that as Steve discussed, CPG's liquidity profile is quite strong, with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity as of September 30. So we don't have to access the equity capital markets until well into 2016. 
And lastly, although we continue to believe that over time, CPPL represents our most efficient equity-raising vehicle, we also have the option of using CPGX equity if we deem it appropriate. As you would expect, we'll continue to closely monitor the capital markets and we'll maintain a thoughtful, balanced and disciplined approach to managing our capital needs through the current cycle. 
At the end of the day, we're very confident that we'll effectively finance the CPG growth portfolio, which I would parenthetically note is built at a compelling CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple of 5 to 7x. And we do our financing in a way that preserves our core financial commitments at both CPG as well as CPPL. 
Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of Columbia Pipeline Group and Columbia Pipeline Partners. With that, Lauren, we're now ready to open the call to questions."

And if I'm to go by prior guidance, you would need $1 billion of equity at the MLP in '16. So I'm under the impression that the public is not really willing to absorb this amount. So when you say that CPGX equity, are you kind of thinking that the parent raise equity at its level and it backs up the $1 billion that the MLP would have to do?"

So when we do look at JVs, when we do look at assets, we're very, very mindful that we do not want to compromise that position and the franchise. Your comment or question about delaying projects. Again, we don't see the need or the opportunity to change the timing in a material way. What we're hearing and seeing from our customer shippers is they want the projects on time and on budget. And if anything, we hear them say more consistently, ""We need that capacity. We need it to move our gas."" So again, we're hearing the producer say, ""Let's go, and let's rock forward."""

And the rating agencies are kind of handicapping us at the beginning, because technically, we're a new company.""

We could need significantly less than $4 billion, but we have to show the credit rating agencies what our track record is, how we're deploying capital, that we're delivering on time and on budget, and we could sustain our metrics. So in the outer years of the plan, yes, we may get relief from the agencies. But near term, I think, we're going to have to deal with the equity."

Those are firm, contracted long-term arrangements that are very solid. And we're also not receiving any indications from our counterparties that they have any interest in changing the contracts or the timing of the capacity that's coming on. As Bob mentioned earlier, if anything, folks are looking for opportunities to get access to capacity as soon as they possibly can. In terms of the notion of a capacity overbuild on a macro basis, our point of view is that we don't see that as a systematic risk that we're facing in the region. We believe that some folks that make that point often double count some of the capacity that is in the process of being built or probably don't handicap very aggressively some projects that may not get built. And our expectation is, if you look out to 2020, that somewhere in the 26, 28 bcf of capacity is likely to match reasonably well with where production is expected to be. And that production is already at 20 Bcf a day here at the fourth quarter of 2015. Could there be pockets? Could there be time periods where have a mismatch between capacity and the supply? Obviously, but we don't regard that as being a systemic kind of scenario that we're likely to face."

Over time, we'll see that transition to a heavier weighting, but not a dominant weighting by the producer community, many of whom are investment grade.

I'll briefly touch on several key strategic takeaways from the quarter. Steve will then review our financial results, and Glen will highlight a number of key execution milestones that the team continues to deliver on. We'll then close with plenty of time for your questions. 
If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see the key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid and squarely in line with our plan. The team delivered net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, of about $69 million in the third quarter versus about $53 million in the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP was about $178 million versus about $126 million in 2014, generating distributable cash flow, non-GAAP, of approximately $111 million. These results keep us squarely on track to deliver on our core commitments, including approximately $680 million in EBITDA for the full year. 
The CPG team also continues to hit its marks on the project execution front. First, we placed 3 key growth projects into service. Columbia transmission's East Side Expansion and the Columbia Midstream Group's Washington County Gathering project and Big Pine Expansion. Second, our larger growth projects are advancing on time and on budget through the permitting, certificate and construction process. Specifically, the Cameron Access and Mountaineer Xpress projects achieved significant FERC certification milestones during the quarter. And thirdly, we placed into service nearly $320 million of modernization projects. 
This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the CPG team's continuing focus on the flawless execution of our business and growth plans. CPG continues to be a very well-positioned pure-play pipeline, midstream, and storage company, with a visible and, indeed, transformational growth investment portfolio that will deliver 20% average annual EBITDA growth and 15% average annual dividend growth through 2020. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our third quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Steve?"

As Bob discussed, we delivered strong net operating earnings from continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interest, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, all non-GAAP, and remains squarely on track to deliver on our financial commitments. For the quarter, CPG net operating earnings from continuing operations of $0.22 per share. CPG's operating revenues for the quarter, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $18 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. Operating expenses, also excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $27 million, primarily due to a $36 million lease monetization cash gain related to the ongoing optimization of CPG's mineral interests, which was included in our May '14 guidance, as well as lower administrative costs, partially offset by increased depreciation, outside service costs and other taxes. 
CPG's total liquidity remains strong, a little more than $1.8 billion as of September 30. 9-month CapEx on cash basis totaled approximately $833 million. Full details of CPG's results are available in our earnings release and related schedules issued and posted online earlier this morning. CPG's year-to-date numbers include pre-separation results that reflect our previous capitalization and tax treatment within NiSource. 
On Slide 5, I'll briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results, which likewise, were squarely in line with our expectations. For the quarter, CPPL reported net income attributable to limited partners of about $22 million or $0.22 per limited common partner unit. CPPL also reported adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP, of about $28 million and generated distributable cash flow, also non-GAAP, of $21 million for the quarter. CPPL's distribution coverage for the year-to-date period was 1.13x and we expect to maintain average coverage of approximately 1x going forward. 
Third quarter capital expenditures were highlighted by about $364 million of expansion capital, primarily attributable to the Leach XPress and Rayne XPress projects, the East Side Expansion project and Columbia Gas Transmission's system modernization program. Maintenance capital for the quarter totaled roughly $29 million. 
On November 2, we announced a cash distribution of $0.1725 per unit to holders of record as of November 13, which is an increase over the prior quarters' distribution. CPPL also continues to maintain a $500 million, 5-year revolving credit facility that became effective July 1. Only $20 million of which has been drawn as of September 30, 2015. 
Again, I would reiterate that these results are in line with our expectations and remain consistent with our May '14 guidance. As a reminder, we expect CPPL to deliver annual distribution growth of 20% through 2020, as measured by the distribution paid in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
With that, I'll hand off to Glen to discuss the business highlights. Glen?"

Across all fronts, the CPG team continues to execute against a proven plan and a deep value-creating inventory of growth and modernization investments. On Slide 6, we highlight our deep investment backlog, the vast majority of which is underpinned by long-term fixed-fee ""take or pay type"" contracts with our customers. As Bob mentioned, the team continued to advance the ball on several key projects that are listed on this slide. The East Side Expansion was placed in service last month and creates additional capacity for Marcellus Shale supplies to reach growing and capacity-constrained northeastern and mid-Atlantic markets. 
Our Cameron Access Project received its FERC certificate in September. This is a $310 million investment that includes enhancements to the existing Columbia Gulf pipeline system as well as the installation of a 26-mile pipeline lateral that will provide direct access to the Cameron LNG export facility. I'd point out that we received the FERC certificate ahead of our original schedule. 
Also, moving forward is the Mountaineer XPress project, which was recently accepted into the FERC's prefiling process. As you'll recall, MXP is the largest project in our company's history and will provide significant new takeaway capacity for Marcellus and Utica Shale production. To that point, MXP will provide up to 2.7 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. 
Our related project on the Columbia Gulf system, Gulf XPress, will provide nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity to Gulf Coast market. Our Columbia Midstream Group also recently placed in service, the initial phases of the Washington County Gathering project as well as the Big Pine Expansion. Gibraltar, which is our 1 billion cubic feet per day dry gas header in southwest Pennsylvania, continues to advance and is expected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of next year, with additional follow-on investment opportunities likely. 
During the third quarter, CMG also further strengthened the Pennant Joint Venture, which now includes Williams Partners affiliate, Three Rivers Midstream. This addition will nearly triple the acreage dedicated to the Pennant system to more than 500,000 acres and is expected to increase Pennant's infrastructure investment opportunities going forward. 
Finally, the team concluded the third year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program, which as you'll recall, is underpinned by a ""first of its kind"" FERC-approved customer settlement. We invested nearly $320 million under the program during 2015, and rate recovery is expected to commence in February of 2016. We've now invested close $1 billion modernizing the Columbia Gas Transmission system and we expect that the program ultimately will entail an investment of $4 billion to $5 billion over 10 to 15 years. I'd also note that the discussions are advancing with our customers, and we're encouraged about the prospects for the extension and expansion of the program. We'll provide periodic updates as those discussions progress over the coming months. Stay tuned. 
On the operations front, I'm pleased to report that our CPG pipeline and storage system as well as our operations and support teams are well prepared for the coming winter season. As exciting as it is to discuss our portfolio of growth investments, and it is, our team fully understands that our #1 priority is to safely and reliably deliver gas to our customers every day. 
Before turning the call back to Bob, let me turn to Slide 7 and reiterate why we believe so firmly in the strength of the CPG business. First, we've got a great core franchise with stable and growing cash flows, driven by long-term, fee-based contracts with a high-quality, diverse customer base. We have a strategically located interstate and midstream footprint sitting literally on top of the Marcellus and Utica Shale production regions. We've got a robust and highly visible portfolio of contracted growth opportunities that we expect to drive strong EBITDA and dividend growth going forward. And as we've noted on a number of occasions, we expect those projects will result in a tripling of CPG's net investment level by 2020. And to that last point, I'd underscore that our bias continues to be to the upside. And finally, as Steve discussed, CPG has a strong financial profile to support this transformational growth, a great combination, and we suggest a compelling investment proposition by any measure. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As",297,"Thanks, Glen. As you can see, continued solid performance across board. Before we break for questions, let me take a moment to speak to the dislocation in the financial markets over the last few months, and the impact on CPG and its financing plans. 
As we visit with investors over the last several months, we've emphasized a number of key points. First, the core fundamentals of our business remain very strong and, if anything, we're stronger as the team continues its almost flawless execution of our plan. 
Second, our financing plan provides us flexibility and latitude. Remember that we effectively over-equitized last February when we raised approximately $1.2 billion in the CPP IPO. I'd also note that as Steve discussed, CPG's liquidity profile is quite strong, with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity as of September 30. So we don't have to access the equity capital markets until well into 2016. 
And lastly, although we continue to believe that over time, CPPL represents our most efficient equity-raising vehicle, we also have the option of using CPGX equity if we deem it appropriate. As you would expect, we'll continue to closely monitor the capital markets and we'll maintain a thoughtful, balanced and disciplined approach to managing our capital needs through the current cycle. 
At the end of the day, we're very confident that we'll effectively finance the CPG growth portfolio, which I would parenthetically note is built at a compelling CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple of 5 to 7x. And we do our financing in a way that preserves our core financial commitments at both CPG as well as CPPL. 
Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of Columbia Pipeline Group and Columbia Pipeline Partners. With that, Lauren, we're now ready to open the call to questions."

I think your tone has changed a little on this call where you guys have been a little more forthcoming about potentially using CPGX equity. Now the MLP, you guys are reiterating the expectation for 20% growth there. So to me, this says that drop down is definitely coming, despite the volatility in the market. And if I'm to go by prior guidance, you would need $1 billion of equity at the MLP in '16. So I'm under the impression that the public is not really willing to absorb this amount. So when you say that CPGX equity, are you kind of thinking that the parent raise equity at its level and it backs up the $1 billion that the MLP would have to do?"

Having said that, we continued to believe in CPPL.

Again, having said that, though, we continue to evaluate the process, CPGX as an equity or as an option, and it's on the table."

Those are firm, contracted long-term arrangements that are very solid. And we're also not receiving any indications from our counterparties that they have any interest in changing the contracts or the timing of the capacity that's coming on. As Bob mentioned earlier, if anything, folks are looking for opportunities to get access to capacity as soon as they possibly can. In terms of the notion of a capacity overbuild on a macro basis, our point of view is that we don't see that as a systematic risk that we're facing in the region. We believe that some folks that make that point often double count some of the capacity that is in the process of being built or probably don't handicap very aggressively some projects that may not get built. And our expectation is, if you look out to 2020, that somewhere in the 26, 28 bcf of capacity is likely to match reasonably well with where production is expected to be. And that production is already at 20 Bcf a day here at the fourth quarter of 2015. Could there be pockets? Could there be time periods where have a mismatch between capacity and the supply? Obviously, but we don't regard that as being a systemic kind of scenario that we're likely to face."

Well, obviously, our historic sort of customer profile has been dominated by local distribution companies, gas fired, electric generators and some producers. Over time, we'll see that transition to a heavier weighting, but not a dominant weighting by the producer community, many of whom are investment grade. And to the extent folks are not investment grade, as a standard practice, we require credit support in connection with growth projects that involve investment on our part. So we take that process very seriously. It's a integral part of the growth project life cycle. But we feel that we're in good shape in terms of the level of credit support and the overall diversity and credit quality of the broader customer base in general."

Near term, we do see opportunities to do additional bite sized projects. But again, we're going to be disciplined, thoughtful and balanced. Clearly, financing is a key component to that consideration, but also, strategic value, what the customer needs will be will also be highly relevant. So we don't want to signal to you or the market that near term, we see multibillion-dollar projects in the next several years. That is not the case. Yes, hopefully that responsive, Steve."
