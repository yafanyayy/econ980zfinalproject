Thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.
We are very pleased to report another solid quarter as well as a year of significant achievements, resulting in a total shareholder return for 2014 of more than 50%.
Let's begin on Slide 5. Over the last 2 years, we have demonstrated a consistent ability to drive broadband growth with 8 consecutive quarters of strong results. In 2014, we delivered net broadband additions of 109,000, bringing our total net addition to nearly 221,000 since the beginning of 2013. This is in addition to 399,000 new broadband customers that came to Frontier as part of the Connecticut acquisition in Q4.
Once again, this broadband growth progress was broad-based across our entire footprint as we improved our market share in approximately 80% of our markets. We have developed marketing plans and programs in order to continue this momentum in 2015. In total, as of the end of 2014, Frontier served nearly 2.4 million residential and business broadband customers.
This improvement in unit trends has helped drive and improved revenue mix with increasing data revenue helping to offset our voice revenue declines as a percent of total revenue. Data, video and other nonvoice revenue like Frontier Secure and CPE sales accounted for more than 60% of revenue in the fourth quarter.
With the addition of Connecticut, we are well positioned for further product and revenue mix improvements in 2015. And of course, the addition of California, Florida and Texas in 2016 will materially increase our presence in the growing data segment.
Another important to highlight of the quarter was the completion of the Connecticut integration after our flash cut conversion in October 2014. As we said in November, we exceeded our initial day 1 synergies target by a factor of 2. And today, we are reporting that we have achieved $165 million in total annualized synergies, which represents more than 80% of the 3-year target we had set at the announcement. Dan will discuss this further in a few minutes.
In the quarter, we continued to improve our revenue trajectory and move closer to our objective of stability, which we believe will ultimately lead to growth. We anticipate making further progress on improving the revenue trajectory in 2015 as well. 
We also remain extremely focused on maintaining strong free cash flow generation. This cash flow provides for support of one of the most attractive dividend payout ratios in our sector. Earlier today, the board followed up on its announcement in December by formerly approving an increase in the first quarter dividend to $0.105 per share to be paid on March 31.
We will have significant opportunities to further drive incremental free cash flow in the coming year as we benefit from the increased scale we have attained as a result of integrating Connecticut into our operations.
Also we are looking forward to the implementation of the SEC's Connect America Fund Phase II to expand and enhance our broadband offerings in additional rural high-class areas. This opportunity will enable us to serve more customers and enhance current broadband speed offerings, which will both drive additional revenue and free cash flow.
And of course, we look forward to the very substantial benefits of our acquisition plans in California; Florida; and Texas, which we expect the close in the first half of 2016.
Before I hand the call over to Dan McCarthy to go in to the details of the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on America's Best Communities prize campaign or ABC. We started this prize campaign along with our partners, DISH Networks and CoBank, in order to drive economic development, revitalization and sustainable growth in small towns and rural communities across our 27 states. ABC dedicates over $10 million in cash and other rewards to support and inspire innovation and investment to transform small towns and these rural communities. And we believe this will attract additional investments from other national and local businesses as well.
To date, we have 135 teams representing 245 communities already registered for the contest and we have more teams registering every week. The ABC website has received more than 30,000 visits. All final applications are due on March 25. This is a great example of how we can take our local engagement model to the next level and illustrate Frontier's continued commitment to small towns as the $10 million prize money will enable these small towns to adopt advance technology in order to become more competitive, provide for more jobs and improve the quality of life in these communities.
In Q4, we also announced that country music legends and scale will be our spokesperson for the contest to its completion. Vince grew up in the small town and is very excited to be part of the ABC contest. We expected to announce the 50 ABC quarter finalists by the end of Q2.
So in summary, Frontier is focused on driving performance and capitalizing on a broad range of opportunity. Our priorities are revenue growth, leading with broadband and operating the business in an efficient and effective manner, which benefits both our customers and our shareholders.
We are doing this by organic growth in our existing footprint; engaging in opportunistic M&A; and improving products, services and local engagement. We expect that this concerted effort will continue to deliver increasing shareholder value into the future just as it has done over the past several years.
So I will now hand the call over to Frontier's President and CEO, Dan McCarthy."

As Maggie referenced the most significant highlight of the fourth quarter was the completion of initial phases of the Connecticut integration. We have now successfully completed 3 full months of billing cycles in Connecticut and are comfortable that we have settled in to a normal operating rhythm. 
In the process of integrating Connecticut, we have achieved annualized synergies of $165 million through the end of fourth quarter and we have a clear path to achieve our $200 million target. While devoting extra focus to Connecticut in the quarter, we achieved broadband net adds of nearly 22,000. Our eighth consecutive quarter of strong growth.
Based on these and other successes, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. We delivered annual free cash flow of $793 million for the trailing 4 quarters, meaningfully above the $755 million to $780 million that we have projected. John will discuss our outlook for 2015 free cash flow in his presentation.
Please turn to Slide 7, where we'll discuss our performance against key strategic operating objectives. First and foremost is leading with broadband. And as mentioned, we grew nearly 22,000 broadband net adds in the fourth quarter. We have introduced Gigabit broadband services in portions of Illinois, North Carolina and Oregon with Indiana, South Carolina and Washington about to launch shortly. 
We are also progressing with our CAF I related broadband bill with 24,700 households completed in the fourth quarter. Among these, 9,500 represented entirely new broadband households and 15,200 represented upgrades in existing areas. We also have begun our initial planning for our CAF 2 implementation and await for the details of the SEC's progress.
In addition, we continue to make significant investments in our fiber backbone and transport systems and will be expanding our national data backbones to 100-gigabit capacity, which facilitates the rollout of gigabit and high-capacity Ethernet services and prepares us for further growth.
Turning to revenue. In the fourth quarter, we made solid progress towards our goal of improving Frontier's revenue trajectory and ultimately driving revenue growth. During the fourth quarter, 40% of broadband activations were above the basic speed tier, which illustrates a strong uptick from the third quarter level of 34%.
More than 80% of our legacy residential base, excluding Connecticut, still purchases broadband at the basic speed tier, which is 6 megabits in most areas. Factoring in Connecticut, this drops to about 75%. But by either measure, we still have substantial room to increase the portion of our base taking higher speed tiers, which drives incremental revenue.
Frontier Secure has continued its rapid year-to-year growth of about 90%. We continue to see good attach rates and we are very enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand Frontier Secure services in Connecticut.
During the fourth quarter, 42% of the broadband adds came through alternate channels, an increase from the third quarter level of 40%. We have implemented a distribution channel strategy in Connecticut with good initial success. All those channels will remain an important focus area for Frontier and will help us diversify our sales risks.
We also remain pleased with the commercial revenue trends within the business segment. Most notably, we have seen 3 consecutive quarters of stability in the large enterprise portion of SME.
In the SME segment overall was once again fairly stable sequentially, despite business segment contraction in the very small space and an intense competitive landscape.
Our third key objective is keeping customers. Both the activations and the churn rate improved from the levels of prior years. And for 2015, we have plans in place, which should yield further improvements in both share and customer retention.
Finally, with respect to our key objectives of business simplification and cost savings, we have a substantial opportunity ahead as we take advantage of the opportunities our larger scale provide following the integration of Connecticut.
You have seen how rapidly we were able to deliver on the day 1 Connecticut synergies by substituting our own cost structure versus the prior owner's allocated cost. The next phase of synergies will be driven for our procurement teams have been working to take advantage of our increased volumes and we expect to continue showing meaningful improvements in many areas.
Let me close by saying that the entire team is fully energized to take on the opportunities that await us in 2015. We are delighted with Connecticut in place to begin part of the Frontier family and we value the great working relationship we are developing with that CWA in Connecticut. Everyone in the company is excited by the news of our plans to acquire markets in California, Florida and Texas. This represents a phenomenal opportunity for our employees to take on new challenges and we are confident that this transaction will be very rewarding for our shareholders, too. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier's earnings per share was $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for expenses related to the acquisition of the AT&T Connecticut properties, a gain recognized on the sale of wireless spectrum and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter 2014 as compared to $0.05 per share in the third quarter 2014 and $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter  2013.
As Maggie mentioned earlier today, the board declared a dividend payment of $0.105 per share for the first quarter of 2015, representing an increase of 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.33 billion, which includes $216 million of revenue from the inclusion of a partial quarter of Connecticut. This represents a quarterly sequential decline of 2% if you exclude the Connecticut results.
Total customer revenue of $1.2 billion includes $207 million of revenue from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the decline was $21 million or 2% as compared to the third quarter.
Total residential customer revenue of $601 million included $116 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, this declined $13 million sequentially, primarily due to voice revenue declines, partially offset by an increase in data revenue in Frontier Secure.
Business customer revenue of [ph] $601 million included $90 [ph] million [ph] from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the $8 million sequential decline was primarily a result of our expected step down in wireless backhaul revenue.
As Dan mentioned, we remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in SME. 
Customer data and increase having decreased slightly by $2 million versus the third quarter of 2014 excluding the Connecticut revenue. Looking forward, excluding the wireless backhaul headwinds, we expect Frontier's data services revenue to continue to grow and to increase as a percentage of overall mix.
Excluding Connecticut, total voice revenue was down sequentially, again reflecting the decline in voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $129 million, and excluding Connecticut, this declined $5 million sequentially.
Despite the anticipated headwinds caused by wireless backhaul, regulatory step downs and the secular voice declines, we are pleased with our progress on improving growth in our data and other revenues to offset these headwinds and bring us closer to our goal of revenue stability.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $65.67 for the fourth quarter 2014, an increase of 8.8% over the third quarter. The addition of video customers and Frontier Secure and Connecticut, broadband customers up tiering their speeds and our continuing trends in broadband market share growth all should contribute to the ARPC trend in 2015.
Business ARPC was up over 4.5% sequentially from the third quarter, primarily due to the addition of medium and enterprise customers in Connecticut. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 42.7%, an increase over the 42.0% in the third quarter. As Maggie and Dan mentioned, we have achieved annualized synergies of $165 million as of the end of the fourth quarter and expect to exceed our $200 million estimate for synergies earlier than our original target of year 3.
Our capital expenditures were $159 million in the fourth quarter and we spent an additional $33 million in CapEx related to the Connecticut integration activities. Further, our CAF-funded expenditures in Q4 were $16 million.
In 2014, we have spent a total of $56 million in CAF funding. Since inception, we had expended [ph] $94 million of the $133 million CAF Phase I funds received, enabling or upgrading broadband services to 164,000 households.
Please turn to Slide 9. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $793 million for the full year 2014, ahead of our guidance range of $755 million to $780 million. For the full year 2014, Frontier paid approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Our dividend payout ratio in 2014 was a strong and sustainable 51%.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 pro forma for Connecticut was 3.72x, in line with our estimates when we first announced the transaction. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Note that our liquidity has consistently remained very strong. 
In 2014, after $400 million of dividend payments, our free cash flow generation funded our operating and capital spend covered approximately $260 million of acquisition and integration costs and provided for $140 million in net debt reduction, excluding funding for that Connecticut acquisition.
Also as of year-end, we satisfied all capital investment requirements imposed in connection with the 2010 Verizon acquisition and all funds have now been released back to us from the related escrow accounts.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness in our leverage ratio over time.
We are comfortable with our leverage ratios and are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
Slide 11 updates our debt maturity profile inclusive of our recently completed debt offering for the Connecticut transaction. We anticipate meeting scheduled 2015 and 2016 debt maturities with cash on hand and net free cash flow. Upon completion of the recently announced Connecticut transaction with Verizon, we believe our total net cash flow will be significantly enhanced.
Please turn to Slide 12. Our guidance for 2015 is outlined as follows: Leverage free cash flow, excluding integration, operating expense and capital expense is estimated to be in the range of $785 million to $825 million. Capital expenditures, excluding those related to cash spending, are estimated to be $650 million to $700 million. And cash taxes are estimated to be $175 million to $200 million. 
Please note that our guidance excludes any OpEx and CapEx related to our Verizon integration opportunities and exceeds and incremental financing costs related to this transaction. 
We have previously estimated total integration costs for the Verizon transaction at approximately $450 million. Of this, in 2015, we estimate $85 million to $135 million of operating expenses and approximately $100 million of capital expenditures. The remainder would be spent in 2016.
In summary, Frontier's Q4 2014 operating results, the full financial impact of the Connecticut transaction, our prudently -- prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.
Please turn to Slide 13. Before we pass the call back for your questions, let me reiterate a few of the key points of our recently announced $10.54 billion transaction with Verizon for the acquisition of their wireline properties in California, Texas and Florida. This is a transformative opportunity. One that meaningfully enhances our long-term competitive position. Further, it significantly enhances shareholder value.
On a pro forma basis, we estimate that in the first full year, this will add approximately $5.4 billion of revenue and $2.3 billion of adjusted day 1 EBITDA. Total new frontier revenue and EBITDA will be approximately $11.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.
We estimate that this transaction will be 35% accretive to our leveraged free cash flow per share and lower our dividend payout ratio by 13 percentage points in the first full year. We are comfortable with the pro forma leverage with our financing plans allowing us to maintain our corporate and unsecured debt ratings. We currently estimate being in the public markets in the second half of 2015 with our capital raising plans that include approximately $3 billion of equity and $8 billion of debt. We will be opportunistic in completing our financing prior to the estimated first half 2016 completion of this transaction.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

And again, we saw a 3x to 4x uptick in the number of calls that you get traditionally when you go through a conversion process. So we did plan for some slowdown on the market share side. What that said, we still grew market share to basically 80% of our footprint in the fourth quarter as well. We also didn't see a lot of incremental growth in Connecticut during that period of time since we were involved in the conversion. So I think as Dan said, as you turn the page into the first quarter, we're back to business as usual. That's one of the nice things about flash cut that lets us get back to into the game and we'll continue to run different kinds of promos and local engagements in our market to make sure we continue to grow share."

Thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.
We are very pleased to report another solid quarter as well as a year of significant achievements, resulting in a total shareholder return for 2014 of more than 50%.
Let's begin on Slide 5. Over the last 2 years, we have demonstrated our consistent ability to drive broadband growth with 8 consecutive quarters of strong results. In 2014, we delivered net broadband additions of 109,000, bringing our total net addition to nearly 221,000 since the beginning of 2013. This is in addition to 399,000 new broadband customers that came to Frontier as part of the Connecticut acquisition in Q4.
Once again, this broadband growth progress was broad-based across our entire footprint as we improved our market share in approximately 80% of our markets. We have developed marketing plans and programs in order to continue this momentum in 2015. In total, as of the end of 2014, Frontier served nearly 2.4 million residential and business broadband customers.
This improvement in unit trends has helped drive and improve revenue mix, with increasing data revenue helping to offset our voice revenue declines as a percent of total revenue. Data, video and other nonvoice revenue like Frontier Secure and CPE sales accounted for more than 60% of revenue in the fourth quarter.
With the addition of Connecticut, we are well-positioned for further product and revenue mix improvements in 2015. And of course, the addition of California, Florida and Texas in 2016 will materially increase our presence in the growing data segment.
Another important to highlight of the quarter was the completion of the Connecticut integration after our flash cut conversion in October 2014. As we said in November, we exceeded our initial day 1 synergies target by a factor of 2. And today, we are reporting that we have achieved $165 million in total annualized synergies, which represents more than 80% of the 3-year target we had set at the announcement. Dan will discuss this further in a few minutes.
In the quarter, we continued to improve our revenue trajectory and move closer to our objective of stability, which we believe will ultimately lead to growth. We anticipate making further progress on improving the revenue trajectory in 2015 as well. 
We also remain extremely focused on maintaining strong free cash flow generation. This cash flow provides for support of one of the most attractive dividend payout ratios in our sector. Earlier today, the board followed up on its announcement in December by formerly approving an increase in the first quarter dividend to $0.105 per share to be paid on March 31.
We will have significant opportunities to further drive incremental free cash flow in the coming year as we benefit from the increased scale we have attained as a result of integrating Connecticut into our operations.
Also we are looking forward to the implementation of the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase 2 to expand and enhance our broadband offerings in additional rural high-cost areas. This opportunity will enable us to serve more customers and enhance current broadband speed offerings, which will both drive additional revenue and free cash flow.
And of course, we look forward to the very substantial benefits of our acquisition plans in California, Florida and Texas, which we expect the close in the first half of 2016.
Before I hand the call over to Dan McCarthy to go in to the details of the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on America's Best Communities prize campaign or ABC. We started this prize campaign along with our partners, DISH Network and CoBank, in order to drive economic development, revitalization and sustainable growth in small towns and rural communities across our 27 states. ABC dedicates over $10 million in cash and other rewards to support and inspire innovation and investment to transform small towns and these rural communities. And we believe this will attract additional investments from other national and local businesses as well.
To date, we have 135 teams representing 245 communities already registered for the contest and we have more teams registering every week. The ABC website has received more than 30,000 visits. All final applications are due on March 25. This is a great example of how we can take our local engagement model to the next level and illustrates Frontier's continued commitment to small towns as the $10 million prize money will enable these small towns to adopt advance technology in order to become more competitive, provide for more jobs and improve the quality of life in these communities.
In Q4, we also announced that country music legend, Vince Gill, will be our spokesperson for the contest through its completion. Vince grew up in the small town and is very excited to be part of the ABC contest. We expected to announce the 50 ABC quarterfinalists by the end of Q2.
So in summary, Frontier is focused on driving performance and capitalizing on a broad range of opportunities. Our priorities are revenue growth, leading with broadband, and operating the business in an efficient and effective manner, which benefits both our customers and our shareholders.
We are doing this by organic growth in our existing footprint, engaging in opportunistic M&A, and improving products, services and local engagement. We expect that this concerted effort will continue to deliver increasing shareholder value into the future, just as it has done over the past several years.
So I will now hand the call over to Frontier's President and COO, Dan McCarthy."

As Maggie referenced, the most significant highlight of the fourth quarter was the completion of the initial phases of the Connecticut integration. We have now successfully completed 3 full months of billing cycles in Connecticut and are comfortable that we have settled in to a normal operating rhythm. 
In the process of integrating Connecticut, we have achieved annualized synergies of $165 million through the end of the fourth quarter and we have a clear path to achieve our $200 million target. While devoting extra focus to Connecticut in the quarter, we achieved broadband net adds of nearly 22,000, our eighth consecutive quarter of strong growth.
Based on this and other successes, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. We delivered annual free cash flow of $793 million for the trailing 4 quarters, meaningfully above the $755 million to $780 million that we have projected. John will discuss our outlook for 2015 free cash flow in his presentation.
Please turn to Slide 7, where I will discuss our performance against key strategic operating objectives. First and foremost is leading with broadband. And as mentioned, we grew nearly 22,000 broadband net adds in the fourth quarter. We have introduced gigabit broadband services in portions of Illinois, North Carolina and Oregon, with Indiana, South Carolina and Washington about to launch shortly. 
We are also progressing with our CAF I related broadband  build, with 24,700 households completed in the fourth quarter. Among these, 9,500 represented entirely new broadband households and 15,200 represented upgrades in existing areas. We also have begun our initial planning for our CAF II implementation and await further details of the FCC's program.
In addition, we continue to make significant investments in our fiber backbone and transport systems and we'll be expanding our national data backbones to 100-gigabit capacity, which facilitates the rollout of gigabit and high-capacity ethernet services and prepares us for further growth.
Turning to revenue. In the fourth quarter, we made solid progress towards our goal of improving Frontier's revenue trajectory and ultimately driving revenue growth. During the fourth quarter, 40% of broadband activations were above the basic speed tier, which illustrates a strong uptick from the third quarter level of 34%.
More than 80% of our legacy residential base, excluding Connecticut, still purchases broadband at the basic speed tier, which is 6 megabits in most areas. Factoring in Connecticut, this drops to about 75%. But by either measure, we still have substantial room to increase the portion of our base taking higher speed tiers, which drives incremental revenue.
Frontier Secure has continued its rapid year-to-year growth of about 90%. We continue to see good attach rates and we are very enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand Frontier Secure services in Connecticut.
During the fourth quarter, 42% of the broadband adds came through alternate channels, an increase from the third quarter level of 40%. We have implemented our distribution channel strategy in Connecticut with good initial success. Alternate channels will remain an important focus area for Frontier and will help us diversify our sales risks.
We also remain pleased with the commercial revenue trends within the business segment. Most notably, we have seen 3 consecutive quarters of stability in the large enterprise portion of SME. And the SME segment overall was once again fairly stable sequentially, despite business segment contraction in the very small space in an intense competitive landscape.
Our third key objective is keeping customers. Both deactivations and the churn rate improved from the levels of prior years. And for 2015, we have plans in place which should yield further improvements in both share and customer retention.
Finally, with respect to our key objectives of business simplification and cost savings, we have a substantial opportunity ahead as we take advantage of the opportunities our larger scale provide following the integration of Connecticut.
You have seen how rapidly we were able to deliver on the day 1 Connecticut synergies by substituting our own cost structure versus the prior owner's allocated cost. The next phase of synergies will be driven by our procurement teams who have been working to take advantage of our increased volumes and we expect to continue showing meaningful improvements in many areas.
Let me close by saying that the entire team is fully energized to take on the opportunities that await us in 2015. We are delighted with Connecticut employees who became part of the Frontier family and we value the great working relationship we are developing with the CWA in Connecticut. Everyone in the company is excited by the news of our plans to acquire markets in California, Florida and Texas. This represents a phenomenal opportunity for our employees to take on new challenges and we are confident that this transaction will be very rewarding for our shareholders, too. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier's earnings per share was $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for expenses related to the acquisition of the AT&T Connecticut properties, a gain recognized on the sale of wireless spectrum and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared to $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.
As Maggie mentioned earlier today, the board declared a dividend payment of $0.105 per share for the first quarter of 2015, representing an increase of 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.33 billion, which includes $216 million of revenue from the inclusion of a partial quarter of Connecticut. This represents a quarterly sequential decline of 2% if you exclude the Connecticut results.
Total customer revenue of $1.2 billion includes $207 million of revenue from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the decline was $21 million or 2% as compared to the third quarter.
Total residential customer revenue of $601 million included $116 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, this declined $13 million sequentially, primarily due to voice revenue declines, partially offset by an increase in data revenue in Frontier Secure.
Business customer revenue $601 million included $90 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the $8 million sequential decline was primarily a result of our expected step down in wireless backhaul revenue.
As Dan mentioned, we remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in SME. 
Customer data and Internet services revenue decreased slightly by $2 million versus the third quarter of 2014, excluding the Connecticut revenue. Looking forward, excluding the wireless backhaul headwinds, we expect Frontier's data services revenue to continue to grow and to increase as a percentage of overall mix.
Excluding Connecticut, total voice revenue was down sequentially, again reflecting the decline in voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $129 million, and excluding Connecticut, this declined $5 million sequentially.
Despite the anticipated headwinds caused by wireless backhaul, regulatory step downs and the secular voice declines, we are pleased with our progress on improving growth in our data and other revenues to offset these headwinds and bring us closer to our goal of revenue stability.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $65.67 for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.8% over the third quarter. The addition of video customers in Frontier Secure and Connecticut, broadband customers up-tiering their speeds and our continuing trends in broadband market share growth all should contribute to the ARPC trend in 2015.
Business ARPC was up over 4.5% sequentially from the third quarter, primarily due to the addition of medium and enterprise customers in Connecticut. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 42.7%, an increase over the 42.0% in the third quarter. As Maggie and Dan mentioned, we have achieved annualized synergies of $165 million as of the end of the fourth quarter and expect to exceed our $200 million estimate for synergies earlier than our original target of year 3.
Our capital expenditures were $159 million in the fourth quarter and we spent an additional $33 million in CapEx related to the Connecticut integration activities. Further, our CAF-funded expenditures in Q4 were $16 million.
In 2014, we have spent a total of $56 million in CAF funding. Since inception, we had expended $94 million of the $133 million CAF Phase I funds received, enabling or upgrading broadband service to 164,000 households.
Please turn to Slide 9. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $793 million for the full year 2014, ahead of our guidance range of $755 million to $780 million. For the full year 2014, Frontier paid approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Our dividend payout ratio in 2014 was a strong and sustainable 51%.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 pro forma for Connecticut was 3.72x, in line with our estimates when we first announced the transaction. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Note that our liquidity has consistently remained very strong. 
In 2014, after $400 million of dividend payments, our free cash flow generation funded our operating and capital spend covered approximately $260 million of acquisition and integration costs and provided for $140 million in net debt reduction, excluding funding for the Connecticut acquisition.
Also as of year-end, we satisfied all capital investment requirements imposed in connection with the 2010 Verizon acquisition and all funds have now been released back to us from the related escrow accounts.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness in our leverage ratio over time.
We are comfortable with our leverage ratios and are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
Slide 11 updates our debt maturity profile, inclusive of our recently completed debt offering for the Connecticut transaction. We anticipate meeting scheduled 2015 and 2016 debt maturities with cash on hand and net free cash flow. Upon completion of the recently announced Connecticut transaction with Verizon -- or announced transaction with Verizon, we believe our total net cash flow will be significantly enhanced.
Please turn to Slide 12. Our guidance for 2015 is outlined as follows: Leverage free cash flow, excluding integration, operating expense and capital expense, is estimated to be in the range of $785 million to $825 million; capital expenditures, excluding those related to cash spending, are estimated to be $650 million to $700 million; and cash taxes are estimated to be $175 million to $200 million. 
Please note that our guidance excludes any OpEx and CapEx related to our Verizon integration activities and excludes any incremental financing costs related to this transaction. 
We have previously estimated total integration costs for the Verizon transaction at approximately $450 million. Of this, in 2015, we estimate $85 million to $135 million of operating expenses and approximately $100 million of capital expenditures. The remainder would be spent in 2016.
In summary, Frontier's Q4 2014 operating results, the full financial impact of the Connecticut transaction, our prudently -- prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.
Please turn to Slide 13. Before we pass the call back for your questions, let me reiterate a few of the key points of our recently announced $10.54 billion transaction with Verizon for the acquisition of their wireline properties in California, Texas and Florida. This is a transformative opportunity, one that meaningfully enhances our long-term competitive position. Further, it significantly enhances shareholder value.
On a pro forma basis, we estimate that in the first full year, this will add approximately $5.4 billion of revenue and $2.3 billion of adjusted day 1 EBITDA. Total new Frontier revenue and EBITDA will be approximately $11.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.
We estimate that this transaction will be 35% accretive to our leveraged free cash flow per share and lower our dividend payout ratio by 13 percentage points in the first full year. We are comfortable with the pro forma leverage with our financing plans allowing us to maintain our corporate and unsecured debt ratings. We currently estimate being in the public markets in the second half of 2015 with our capital raising plans that include approximately $3 billion of equity and $8 billion of debt. We will be opportunistic in completing our financing prior to the estimated first half 2016 completion of this transaction.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

We did focus on capital and capital expenditures. We also focused on marketing, we focused on customer retention with them, we focused on communications with employees and also training of the employees so they would be ready for the cutover. So we took a lot of the playbook from the 2010 Verizon acquisition and made sure that we are well-prepared with this acquisition and we plus that up based upon also what we learned in Connecticut.

And then, second, I guess, Dan, on the synergies, $165 million run rate from Connecticut, obviously, this is steering very quickly to the $200 million number you laid out almost a year ago or more than a year ago, and it kind of feels like that number is going to have to go higher. If you could kind of talk about what some of the reasons why it's not going to go higher than $200 million, it will be helpful. And then, maybe, Maggie, for you, you kind of highlighted that part of the Connecticut deal value to the equity holder was the dividend hike that you announced for the first quarter this year. As we look ahead to this very accretive Verizon acquisition, can we start thinking about the prospects for a similar style return of value to the equity holders? And if so, could you kind of elaborate a little of how you're thinking about it?"

I think, you know we are a very shareholder-friendly company. We've been a high dividend payer, we continue to be. And our board feels very strongly about that. So as we integrate these 3 new properties and we start to realize the accretion, we will review the dividend at that time along with how we would use our cash to invest in the business, to support our networks, which is really important to us to pay down debt so we keep our leverage ratio at an appropriate level. But we will continue to look at the dividend every single quarter. And once we get these properties integrated, I think, it gives us opportunity."

And again, we saw a 3x to 4x uptick in the number of calls that you get traditionally when you go through a conversion process. So we did plan for some slowdown on the market share side. With that said, we still grew market share at basically 80% of our footprint in the fourth quarter as well. We also didn't see a lot of incremental growth in Connecticut during that period of time since we were involved in the conversion. So I think, as Dan said, as you turn the page into the first quarter, we're back to business as usual. That's one of the nice things about flash cut is lets us get back into the game and we'll continue to run different kinds of promos and local engagements in our market to make sure we continue to grow share."

And if you add to that the speed upgrade, as Dan mentioned, I mean, we've continued to see customers, as they use more and more broadband, both business and consumer, upgrading and taking more services which drives more revenues.

Just another point of view on this, too, is over the last 5 years, we have invested a substantial amount of capital into the Verizon markets that we purchased in 2010 because they were fixer-upper markets, they had networks that were not built out. So we did increase the amount of capital that we needed to spend on an annual basis in order to get those markets where they needed to be. Part of the benefit of doing that is we put in this ROADM network for the middle mile which is basically all fiber, it's a really great network. And we built it in such a way that it would have longevity to take care of traffic over a number of years. So as Dan said, I think, we've been preparing these networks for a period of time. And when we do our capital planning, we don't say, okay, it's going to be 12% of revenue. We really take a look at it and say, what do we have to do to be competitive in these markets, what do we have to do to drive our business plan of more market share for broadband, higher revenues, keep our margins where they need to be and that's how we build our plans from the bottom up.

Thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.
We are very pleased to report another solid quarter as well as a year of significant achievements, resulting in a total shareholder return for 2014 of more than 50%.
Let's begin on Slide 5. Over the last 2 years, we have demonstrated our consistent ability to drive broadband growth with 8 consecutive quarters of strong results. In 2014, we delivered net broadband additions of 109,000, bringing our total net addition to nearly 221,000 since the beginning of 2013. This is in addition to 399,000 new broadband customers that came to Frontier as part of the Connecticut acquisition in Q4.
Once again, this broadband growth progress was broad-based across our entire footprint as we improved our market share in approximately 80% of our markets. We have developed marketing plans and programs in order to continue this momentum in 2015. In total, as of the end of 2014, Frontier served nearly 2.4 million residential and business broadband customers.
This improvement in unit trends has helped drive an improved revenue mix, with increasing data revenue helping to offset our voice revenue declines as a percent of total revenue. Data, video and other nonvoice revenue like Frontier Secure and CPE sales accounted for more than 60% of revenue in the fourth quarter.
With the addition of Connecticut, we are well-positioned for further product and revenue mix improvements in 2015. And of course, the addition of California, Florida and Texas in 2016 will materially increase our presence in the growing data segments.
Another important to highlight of the quarter was the completion of the Connecticut integration after our flash cut conversion in October 2014. As we said in November, we exceeded our initial day 1 synergies target by a factor of 2. And today, we are reporting that we have achieved $165 million in total annualized synergies, which represents more than 80% of the 3-year target we had set at the announcement. Dan will discuss this further in a few minutes.
In the quarter, we continued to improve our revenue trajectory and move closer to our objective of stability, which we believe will ultimately lead to growth. We anticipate making further progress on improving the revenue trajectory in 2015 as well. 
We also remain extremely focused on maintaining strong free cash flow generation. This cash flow provides for support of one of the most attractive dividend payout ratios in our sector. Earlier today, the board followed up on its announcement in December by formerly approving an increase in the first quarter dividend to $0.105 per share to be paid on March 31.
We will have significant opportunities to further drive incremental free cash flow in the coming year as we benefit from the increased scale we have attained as a result of integrating Connecticut into our operations.
Also we are looking forward to the implementation of the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase 2 to expand and enhance our broadband offerings in additional rural high-cost areas. This opportunity will enable us to serve more customers and enhance current broadband speed offerings, which will both drive additional revenue and free cash flow.
And of course, we look forward to the very substantial benefits of our acquisition plans in California, Florida and Texas, which we expect to close in the first half of 2016.
Before I hand the call over to Dan McCarthy to go in to the details of the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on America's Best Communities prize campaign or ABC. We started this prize campaign along with our partners, DISH Network and CoBank, in order to drive economic development, revitalization and sustainable growth in small towns and rural communities across our 27 states. ABC dedicates over $10 million in cash and other rewards to support and inspire innovation and investment to transform small towns and these rural communities. And we believe this will attract additional investments from other national and local businesses as well.
To date, we have 135 teams representing 245 communities already registered for the contest and we have more teams registering every week. The ABC website has received more than 30,000 visits. All final applications are due on March 25. This is a great example of how we can take our local engagement model to the next level and illustrates Frontier's continued commitment to small towns as the $10 million prize money will enable these small towns to adopt advanced technology in order to become more competitive, provide for more jobs and improve the quality of life in these communities.
In Q4, we also announced that country music legend, Vince Gill, will be our spokesperson for the contest through its completion. Vince grew up in a small town and is very excited to be part of the ABC contest. We expected to announce the 50 ABC quarterfinalists by the end of Q2.
So in summary, Frontier is focused on driving performance and capitalizing on a broad range of opportunities. Our priorities are revenue growth, leading with broadband, and operating the business in an efficient and effective manner, which benefits both our customers and our shareholders.
We are doing this by organic growth in our existing footprint, engaging in opportunistic M&A, and improving products, services and local engagement. We expect that this concerted effort will continue to deliver increasing shareholder value into the future, just as it has done over the past several years.
So I will now hand the call over to Frontier's President and COO, Dan McCarthy."

As Maggie referenced, the most significant highlight of the fourth quarter was the completion of the initial phases of the Connecticut integration. We have now successfully completed 3 full months of billing cycles in Connecticut and are comfortable that we have settled into a normal operating rhythm. 
In the process of integrating Connecticut, we have achieved annualized synergies of $165 million through the end of the fourth quarter and we have a clear path to achieve our $200 million target. While devoting extra focus to Connecticut in the quarter, we achieved broadband net adds of nearly 22,000, our eighth consecutive quarter of strong growth.
Based on this and other successes, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. We delivered annual free cash flow of $793 million for the trailing 4 quarters, meaningfully above the $755 million to $780 million that we had projected. John will discuss our outlook for 2015 free cash flow in his presentation.
Please turn to Slide 7, where I will discuss our performance against key strategic operating objectives. First and foremost is leading with broadband. And as mentioned, we grew nearly 22,000 broadband net adds in the fourth quarter. We have introduced gigabit broadband services in portions of Illinois, North Carolina and Oregon, with Indiana, South Carolina and Washington about to launch shortly. 
We are also progressing with our CAF I related broadband  build, with 24,700 households completed in the fourth quarter. Among these, 9,500 represented entirely new broadband households and 15,200 represented upgrades in existing areas. We also have begun our initial planning for our CAF II implementation and await further details of the FCC's program.
In addition, we continue to make significant investments in our fiber backbone and transport systems and we'll be expanding our national data backbones to 100-gigabit capacity, which facilitates the rollout of gigabit and high-capacity Ethernet services and prepares us for further growth.
Turning to revenue. In the fourth quarter, we made solid progress towards our goal of improving Frontier's revenue trajectory and ultimately driving revenue growth. During the fourth quarter, 40% of broadband activations were above the basic speed tier, which illustrates a strong uptick from the third quarter level of 34%.
More than 80% of our legacy residential base, excluding Connecticut, still purchases broadband at the basic speed tier, which is 6 megabits in most areas. Factoring in Connecticut, this drops to about 75%. But by either measure, we still have substantial room to increase the portion of our base taking higher speed tiers, which drives incremental revenue.
Frontier Secure has continued its rapid year-to-year growth of about 90%. We continue to see good attach rates and we are very enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand Frontier Secure services in Connecticut.
During the fourth quarter, 42% of the broadband adds came through alternate channels, an increase from the third quarter level of 40%. We have implemented our distribution channel strategy in Connecticut with good initial success. Alternate channels will remain an important focus area for Frontier and will help us diversify our sales risks.
We also remain pleased with the commercial revenue trends within the business segment. Most notably, we have seen 3 consecutive quarters of stability in the large enterprise portion of SME. And the SME segment overall was once again fairly stable sequentially, despite business segment contraction in the very small space and in an intense competitive landscape.
Our third key objective is keeping customers. Both de-activations and the churn rate improved from the levels of prior years. And for 2015, we have plans in place which should yield further improvements in both share and customer retention.
Finally, with respect to our key objectives of business simplification and cost savings, we have a substantial opportunity ahead as we take advantage of the opportunities our larger scale provides following the integration of Connecticut.
You have seen how rapidly we were able to deliver on the day 1 Connecticut synergies by substituting our own cost structure versus the prior owner's allocated cost. The next phase of synergies will be driven by our procurement teams who have been working to take advantage of our increased volumes and we expect to continue showing meaningful improvements in many areas.
Let me close by saying that the entire team is fully energized to take on the opportunities that await us in 2015. We are delighted with Connecticut employees who became part of the Frontier family and we value the great working relationship we are developing with the CWA in Connecticut. Everyone in the company is excited by the news of our plans to acquire markets in California, Florida and Texas. This represents a phenomenal opportunity for our employees to take on new challenges and we are confident that this transaction will be very rewarding for our shareholders, too. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier's earnings per share was $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for expenses related to the acquisition of the AT&T Connecticut properties, a gain recognized on the sale of wireless spectrum and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared to $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.
As Maggie mentioned earlier today, the board declared a dividend payment of $0.105 per share for the first quarter of 2015, representing an increase of 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.33 billion, which includes $216 million of revenue from the inclusion of a partial quarter of Connecticut. This represents a quarterly sequential decline of 2% if you exclude the Connecticut results.
Total customer revenue of $1.2 billion includes $207 million of revenue from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the decline was $21 million or 2% as compared to the third quarter.
Total residential customer revenue of $601 million included $116 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, this declined $13 million sequentially, primarily due to voice revenue declines, partially offset by an increase in data revenue in Frontier Secure.
Business customer revenue of $601 million included $90 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the $8 million sequential decline was primarily a result of our expected step down in wireless backhaul revenue.
As Dan mentioned, we remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in SME. 
Customer data and Internet services revenue decreased slightly by $2 million versus the third quarter of 2014, excluding the Connecticut revenue. Looking forward, excluding the wireless backhaul headwinds, we expect Frontier's data services revenue to continue to grow and to increase as a percentage of overall mix.
Excluding Connecticut, total voice revenue was down sequentially, again reflecting the decline in voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $129 million, and excluding Connecticut, this declined $5 million sequentially.
Despite the anticipated headwinds caused by wireless backhaul, regulatory step downs and the secular voice declines, we are pleased with our progress on improving growth in our data and other revenues to offset these headwinds and bring us closer to our goal of revenue stability.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $65.67 for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.8% over the third quarter. The addition of video customers in Frontier Secure and Connecticut, broadband customers up-tiering their speeds and our continuing trends in broadband market share growth all should contribute to the ARPC trend in 2015.
Business ARPC was up over 4.5% sequentially from the third quarter, primarily due to the addition of medium and enterprise customers in Connecticut. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 42.7%, an increase over the 42.0% in the third quarter. As Maggie and Dan mentioned, we have achieved annualized synergies of $165 million as of the end of the fourth quarter and expect to exceed our $200 million estimate for synergies earlier than our original target of year 3.
Our capital expenditures were $159 million in the fourth quarter and we spent an additional $33 million in CapEx related to the Connecticut integration activities. Further, our CAF-funded expenditures in Q4 were $16 million.
In 2014, we have spent a total of $56 million in CAF funding. Since inception, we have expended $94 million of the $133 million CAF Phase I funds received, enabling or upgrading broadband service to 164,000 households.
Please turn to Slide 9. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $793 million for the full year 2014, ahead of our guidance range of $755 million to $780 million. For the full year 2014, Frontier paid approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Our dividend payout ratio in 2014 was a strong and sustainable 51%.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 pro forma for Connecticut was 3.72x, in line with our estimates when we first announced the transaction. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Note that our liquidity has consistently remained very strong. 
In 2014, after $400 million of dividend payments, our free cash flow generation funded our operating and capital spend covered approximately $260 million of acquisition and integration costs and provided for $140 million in net debt reduction, excluding funding for the Connecticut acquisition.
Also as of year-end, we satisfied all capital investment requirements imposed in connection with the 2010 Verizon acquisition and all funds have now been released back to us from the related escrow accounts.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio over time.
We are comfortable with our leverage ratios and are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
Slide 11 updates our debt maturity profile, inclusive of our recently completed debt offering for the Connecticut transaction. We anticipate meeting scheduled 2015 and 2016 debt maturities with cash on hand and net free cash flow. Upon completion of the recently announced Connecticut transaction with Verizon -- or announced transaction with Verizon, we believe our total net cash flow will be significantly enhanced.
Please turn to Slide 12. Our guidance for 2015 is outlined as follows: Leverage free cash flow, excluding integration, operating expense and capital expense, is estimated to be in the range of $785 million to $825 million; capital expenditures, excluding those related to cash spending, are estimated to be $650 million to $700 million; and cash taxes are estimated to be $175 million to $200 million. 
Please note that our guidance excludes any OpEx and CapEx related to our Verizon integration activities and excludes any incremental financing costs related to this transaction. 
We have previously estimated total integration costs for the Verizon transaction at approximately $450 million. Of this, in 2015, we estimate $85 million to $135 million of operating expenses and approximately $100 million of capital expenditures. The remainder would be spent in 2016.
In summary, Frontier's Q4 2014 operating results, the full financial impact of the Connecticut transaction, our prudently -- prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.
Please turn to Slide 13. Before we pass the call back for your questions, let me reiterate a few of the key points of our recently announced $10.54 billion transaction with Verizon for the acquisition of their wireline properties in California, Texas and Florida. This is a transformative opportunity, one that meaningfully enhances our long-term competitive position. Further, it significantly enhances shareholder value.
On a pro forma basis, we estimate that in the first full year, this will add approximately $5.4 billion of revenue and $2.3 billion of adjusted day 1 EBITDA. Total new Frontier revenue and EBITDA will be approximately $11.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.
We estimate that this transaction will be 35% accretive to our leveraged free cash flow per share and lower our dividend payout ratio by 13 percentage points in the first full year. We are comfortable with the pro forma leverage, with our financing plans allowing us to maintain our corporate and unsecured debt ratings. We currently estimate being in the public markets in the second half of 2015 with our capital raising plans that include approximately $3 billion of equity and $8 billion of debt. We will be opportunistic in completing our financing prior to the estimated first half 2016 completion of this transaction.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

We actually improved sequentially from Q3. So we were pleased there and we continue to pick up customers in both our data revenue as well as triple-play customers. We did see some decline in voice, that was not unexpected for us, but we did continue to grow in our data revenue segment. So on balance, it was kind of what we had expected. And certainly, we outlined that a few weeks ago when we previewed our results. And I would say, too, that we had in our business segment is the anticipated wireless backhaul headwinds. We knew that those were there and that was really the driver in our business segment."

And again, we saw a 3x to 4x uptick in the number of calls that you get traditionally when you go through a conversion process. So we did plan for some slowdown on the market share side. With that said, we still grew market share at basically 80% of our footprint in the fourth quarter as well. We also didn't see a lot of incremental growth in Connecticut during that period of time since we were involved in the conversion. So I think, as Dan said, as you turn the page into the first quarter, we're back to business as usual.

But I think, what we try to do is we try to look at: What do we need, to make sure that we got a highly competitive and well-enabled network? And we think that the CapEx guidance range that we provided allows us to do that quite well for our business this year."

Just another point of view on this, too, is over the last 5 years, we have invested a substantial amount of capital into the Verizon markets that we purchased in 2010 because they were fixer-upper markets, they had networks that were not built out. So we did increase the amount of capital that we needed to spend on an annual basis in order to get those markets where they needed to be. Part of the benefit of doing that is we put in this ROADM network for the middle mile which is basically all fiber, it's a really great network. And we built it in such a way that it would have longevity to take care of traffic over a number of years. So as Dan said, I think, we've been preparing these networks for a period of time. And when we do our capital planning, we don't say, okay, it's going to be 12% of revenue. We really take a look and say, what do we have to do to be competitive in these markets? What do we have to do to drive our business plan of more market share for broadband, higher revenues, keep our margins where they need to be? And that's how we build our plans from the bottom up. So we don't sit there and say, okay, let's just use 12% of revenue. Sometimes, it turns out to be 12%, sometimes it's turned out to be 15%, sometimes it's turned out to be 10%. So we don't really take those averages that a lot of people talk about and use that as our planning tool."

We are very pleased to report on another quarter of solid results in our continuing business, the successful completion of our first full quarter in Connecticut and good progress toward the completion of our transformative Verizon acquisition.
Let's begin on Slide 5. We had more than 17,100 net new broadband customers in the first quarter. This represents our ninth consecutive quarter of robust broadband growth. Our strong execution in broadband continued to be broadly based across our footprint. We took residential broadband share in 77% of our markets in Q1. 44% of broadband activity in the first quarter was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits, which represents another quarter progress from the 40% of activity in Q4 and a dramatic improvement from the mid-teens level of 2 years ago. This results from our efforts to make higher-speed options available to customers. That said, roughly 3/4 of our base of residential broadband customers remain at the basic speed tier, so we still have substantial runway to migrate the majority of our customers to higher-speed tiers and to drive higher revenue.
I'm also very pleased to report that SME revenue was stable sequentially in Q1, excluding CPE and Connecticut. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of stability in SME. We exclude CPE because it tends to be very uneven from quarter to quarter, and we exclude Connecticut revenue because it had a large sequential step-up as a result of the Q1 period being the first full quarter of contribution.
Based on our 5 months of Connecticut experience so far through March, the SME trend in the state has been stable, and we are optimistic about the potential going forward.
Looking more broadly at Connecticut. We completed our first full quarter of operations and took actions that we believe will promote our long-term success. In the quarter, we allowed a significant percentage of the Connecticut bundle customers who were no longer under contract to migrate to our current promotion. This is consistent with our normal practices, but was not the practice in Connecticut previously. As a result, we did experience an impact in Connecticut residential revenue in the quarter. In addition, when a customer's AT&T promotions were scheduled to expire, we chose to continue the promotional price in order to shield the customer from a price increase. As of the end of March, we have begun migrating these customers to market pricing, and we expect this to have a positive impact on ARPC in residential revenues in Q2 and future periods. Our goal was to start our relationships with these customers on the right foot, and we believe it was the correct long-term choice for the business. These actions were concentrated in the months of January and February. Now that we have moved to a more normal customer-based management strategy, I'm pleased with the trends and the results. For instance, in March, we experienced stabilization across all revenue segments and growth in some key areas. Based on what we've seen so far, these favorable trends continued in April. And we are confident that our execution plan is succeeding.
To recap, these actions impacted only Connecticut residential customers and revenue and were isolated to Q1 in the month of January and February. Already in March and April, we have moved back to a more normal revenue trajectory, and we feel good about the trend going forward.
With respect to Connecticut profitability, the results are strong with expenses lower as we apply the Frontier go-to-market philosophy and cost structures to these operations. Comparing the current level of OpEx of the Connecticut properties with the same period in 2014 shows we have reduced operating expense levels in excess of $230 million annually. This exceeds our original forecast, and we continue to develop additional synergy targets as we continue to operate the acquired system in our Frontier ecosystems. As a result, the contribution to EBITDA due to Connecticut operations continues to be very strong, despite the residential revenue declines we experienced in the beginning of Q1.
Let me now give you an update on the Verizon transaction. We have made significant progress with our integration planning activities and are on track with the milestones we outlined when we announced the deal in February. We have assembled a very strong integration planning team consisting of leaders with diverse skills and whose collective experience in this type of integration is truly unparalleled. We are working on functional gap identification and remediation. Our team remains confident in our ability to complete the conversion and integration in the time frame we have identified. We have begun the approval process, filing applications with regulatory authorities at the federal and state level. We are fully engaged with the commission staff and various parties in both approval processes. We remain very optimistic that we will be successful on all fronts. We will provide additional feedback on progress as we meet key milestones in our ongoing investor calls. We remain very excited about the benefits of the Verizon transaction for our customers and our shareholders. As we have previously stated, this transaction continues a fundamental transformation of Frontier that really commenced with our 2010 Verizon transaction.
Please turn to Slide 6. In 2009, only 30% of our revenue was data and video, with voice and regulatory comprising the remaining 70%. After the completion of the current Verizon transaction, this mix will be dramatically improved. We anticipate that data and video will comprise 55%, with voice and regulatory now constituting a declining and less significant portion. And of course, we will also have substantially greater scale. At the same time, we will continue to maintain our industry-leading margins. These high margins result from our intense focus on operational efficiency that benefits on increased scale and our ability to transition these properties to the Frontier cost structure. The combination of these items will allow us to achieve our synergy target of $700 million per year by our third year of ownership.
Please turn to Slide 7. For these reasons, we see the Verizon acquisition as a transformative opportunity that will meaningfully enhance Frontier's long-term competitive position, diversify our business and significantly increase shareholder value. We estimate that the completion of this transaction will provide 35% accretion to leverage free cash flow per share in the first full year and will improve our dividend payout ratio by an estimated 13 percentage points. We plan to raise capital to fund acquisition. We anticipate raising approximately $3 billion in equity or equity-linked securities, followed by an approximately $7.9 billion in debt. We have planned our financing such that the resulting capital structure will maintain our current debt ratings. We will be opportunistic in completing our equity and debt raises with a goal of completing them in the Q3 to Q4 time frame, in advance of the estimated first half of 2016 closing of this transaction.
As most of you know, on April 3, we completed a smooth, well-planned CEO transition. Maggie Wilderotter has become Executive Chairman, and I'm very honored and pleased to have the opportunity to serve as Frontier's CEO. Having witnessed the growth and transformation of our company over the last 25 years, I believe the company is at its brightest point in my career, and our team is excited about the future. I would like to thank Maggie for her vision, her dedication and her strong support during the last 10.5 years.
Finally, turning to Slide 8. Let me say a few words about my vision for Frontier. First, retaining customers will be at the top of my list of priorities. The first step in growing our business is to retain our existing customers. We will move to a more balanced approach to acquisition and retention with a laser-focus on retaining our customers. Second, we will grow broadband market share. This will be in both residential and commercial segments. We continue to focus on diversifying distribution channels and utilizing speed, simplicity and choice to different shade in our markets. We'll continue to invest in our networks to enable speed and capacity.
In this regard, let me update you on a key development on Connect America Fund II. In the last week, we received notification from the SEC that we are eligible to receive $283 million in CAF II support. This will allow us to invest in underserved as well as unserved areas. This reflects approximately $133 million of additional funding more than our current support levels. We were reviewing the support on a state-by-state basis and expect to accept the majority of the funds. Until we complete that review and determine the deployment schedule for 2015, we are maintaining our current guidance for leveraged free cash flow and CapEx. We are pleased with this development and will be an important component of our broadband strategy. Third, commercial sales offers us a growth opportunity. We've spent the last 4 years enhancing our network, having partners and distribution channels and upgrading our information systems. We are now poised to leverage all of these investments, and we have already begun to see the results in 5 quarters of SME revenue stability. This area remains one of our top opportunities, and we will continue to pursue it relentlessly. And fourth, video in all flavors will be incredibly important to our success. Following the integration of the Verizon assets in 2016, we will have close to 1.8 million video customers in all categories, more than triple our current number. This enhanced scale, together with exciting advancements in technology, will create tremendous new opportunities for Frontier.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier reported a loss per share of $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 compared to earnings per share of $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusting for acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs and severance cost, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2014. The board declared a dividend payment of $0.105 per share for the second quarter of 2015, in line with the increased dividend in the first quarter.
Please turn to Slide 9. First quarter revenue was $1.37 billion, which includes $264 million of revenue from the inclusion of the first full quarter of Connecticut. This represents a quarterly sequential decline of 0.7%, excluding Connecticut, an improvement as compared to the 2.3% sequential -- quarterly sequential decline in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Total customer revenue of $1.2 billion includes $254 million of revenue from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, customer revenue declined by $16 million or 1.6% as compared to the fourth quarter. However, taking into account the anticipated and previously discussed decline in wireless backhaul revenue, the rate of quarterly customer revenue decline improved in our legacy footprint from negative 1.8% sequentially in the fourth quarter of '14 down to negative 1.3% in the first quarter.
Total residential customer revenue of $617 million included $138 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the residential customer revenue trend improved sequentially with a decline in Q1 of only $6 million as compared to $13 million decline in Q4 '14. Residential data revenue increased 10% over the prior year, partially offsetting a decline in voice revenue. Including Connecticut, residential data revenue increased by nearly 2.5% sequentially -- pardon me, nearly 5% [ph] sequentially.
Customer revenue -- business customer revenue of $616 million included $116 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the $10 million sequential decline was primarily a result of voice declines and the expected step-down in Wireless backhaul revenue. We continue to be encouraged by the trends we're seeing in SME, as Dan discussed.
Total data and Internet services revenue increased $20 million [ph] sequentially with the first quarter -- with a full quarter impact of our Connecticut operations. The legacy operation showed a modest increase with our data services growth outstripping the non-switched revenue declines. The drivers of growth in data services included 10% year-over-year increase in residential data service and a 20% year-over-year increase in business ethernet services, for a total year-over-year quarterly increase of nearly 12%, excluding our Connecticut operations.
We continue to anticipate that Frontier's data services revenue should grow and increase as a percentage of overall mix, excluding the wireless backhaul headwinds.
Excluding Connecticut, total voice revenue was down sequentially, although an improvement in the quarterly sequential rate of decline from Q4 '14, again reflecting the industry secular headwinds of declining voice customers. This decline was offset by the incremental revenue from Connecticut.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $138 million. And excluding Connecticut, this improved $9 million sequentially.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $64.13 for the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.3% sequentially. As Dan discussed, this was due to the price migration of certain Connecticut bundle customers who moved to Frontier's pricing bundles. We have seen this migration level off in March and April and are already seeing monthly sequential stable trends early on in the second quarter.
Business ARPC was down 1.5% sequentially with a wireless backhaul being a factor in this decline. ARPC for SME was stable sequentially, illustrating stable trends in both legacy and Connecticut operations.
The adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 41.1%. Our margins continued to lead the way in our telecom cable sector with our relentless focus on expense management and continuous operational improvements.
Cash operating expenses in our legacy footprint declined 1% in the first quarter as compared to Q4 '14, and we're nearly flat year-over-year as compared to Q1 '14, despite an increased headcount to support our Frontier Secure strategic partnership service offering. We have achieved the annualized cost synergies in the Connecticut acquisition of $230 million as of the end of the first quarter, exceeding our $200 million target for synergies and far earlier than our original timing of year 3.
Capital expenditures were $170 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $10 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Further, our capital funded expenditures in Q1 were $9 million. Since inception, we have expanded $103 million of the $133 million CAF Phase 1 funds received, enabling our operating broadband service to 188,700 households today, including an incremental 24,700 households within this past quarter. We currently anticipate completing our CAF I obligations in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leverage free cash flow was $197 million in the first quarter and we are on track for our full year guidance range of $785 million to $825 million. First quarter cash tax payments were $17 million. Our trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 54%.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.85x, in line with our estimates when we first announced the transaction. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and credit availability. We've repaid debt of $129 million in the first quarter. Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness in our leverage ratio over time. We are comfortable with our leverage levels and are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
Slide 12 contains our debt maturity profile as of the end of the first quarter. Since the close of the first quarter, we have repaid an additional $97 million in maturing debt obligations.
Please turn to Slide 13. Our guidance for 2015 remains unchanged as follows: leveraged free cash flow is estimated to be in the range of $785 million to $825 million; capital expenditures, excluding those related to CAF spending, are estimated to be $650 million to $700 million; and cash taxes are estimated to be $175 million to $200 million. This guidance excludes spending related to acquisition and integration expenses. We will update our guidance after our decisions are finalized regarding CAF II.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2015 operating results, the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and our expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.

Can you provide more color on the expenses that you had in the quarter, if there were any onetimers? Or what drove that higher spending? And second question, on the churn. It picked up a little bit in the first quarter. You did mention that, in Connecticut, you went to market pricing in March. Was that the main cause of the uptick in churn? And how do you expect this new pricing in Connecticut to impact subscriber trends, both on the video and the broadband side?"

They were really upset with, I think, the disputes between DISH and some of the content players, and they opted for another provider who provided triple play for them. And then the part on our own system, really costs when we went through Connecticut conversion. We did have some hiccups that we talked about on previous calls. So we had a slightly higher churn level in January and February. That really did mitigate quite a bit in March and has come down to normal levels in April. We absolutely believe that migrating customers to the right price point in the market improves the characteristics of that customer relationship.

So first off, you should think about -- when I think about Connecticut and the impact it's had on the business, first of all, the commercial side of the business in Connecticut has been very stable. We're very pleased with the results that we're experiencing there. We think there's a lot of opportunity in Connecticut, and it just takes a little while to start to tap into that opportunity as you build your sales channels and build the relationships between our sales force and the customers and the market. You really can't accelerate that too quickly. It's really building those relationships over time. Really, a lot of the noise that occurred was around the residential customers. And the residential customers, there were a couple of things that we did in the quarter that both allowed customers to move to market-based pricing, but we also purposely held rates on promotions from increasing. We did not want customers to have a rate increase right in their first bill or second bill with us as their provider and then have to call in during a period of high call volumes because that would be a bad experience for customers. So we implemented a program of migrating those customers really starting towards the end of March with a very thorough communication plan and giving them insight into what their new bill would be, as well as the opportunity if they wanted to change plans moving forward. We've had very good experience with that. So I don't see a lot more choppiness from migrations moving forward. We've kind of steadied out. There was a big backlog, for lack of a better way of describing it, since AT&T had stopped doing marketing and really had a different approach to allowing customers to migrate to acquisition-type offers. And in our case, acquisition offers are kind of our everyday pricing in the market. So there was about 4 or 5 months of backlog that occurred just prior to conversion and then up through January and February. We worked through that. So I don't think you'll see any more of that and should start to see a stabilization as we exit Q1 and into Q2."

The way the process works is that if we were to decline to take the support as highlighted, then we would be eligible for kind of a step-down approach on the frozen support that's currently in place. In all scenarios that we envision right now, this would be a very positive benefit for us, and we would see incremental benefit to the tune of $100 million to $133 million approximately, depending upon whether we take all of the support to our current support level.

We saw some strong results. We took market share in 77% of the markets across the country. I think if there was anything that slowed down our total broadband additions, it's simply that during the first quarter we still rely on our contact centers for about 60% in any quarter of our broadband additions. And as you go through a large integration as we did, those high call volumes tend to disrupt our universal cues around the country. And as a result, it impacted our gross additions across the country, quite frankly, by a few thousand. But I would say that, in general, we still are very bullish on the legacy markets. And we look forward to the investments that we're going to make in Connecticut to expand and extend U-verse as well as upgrade the U-verse capabilities as well as upgrade the more traditional DSL services. And all of those costs to do that are in our commitments to the State of Connecticut and in our guidance for this year."

We are very pleased to report on another quarter of solid results in our continuing business, the successful completion of our first full quarter in Connecticut and good progress toward the completion of our transformative Verizon acquisition.
Let's begin on Slide 5. We added more than 17,100 net new broadband customers in the first quarter. This represents our ninth consecutive quarter of robust broadband growth. Our strong execution in broadband continued to be broadly based across our footprint. We took residential broadband share in 77% of our markets in Q1. 44% of broadband activity in the first quarter was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits, which represents another quarter of progress from the 40% of activity in Q4 and a dramatic improvement from the mid-teens level of 2 years ago. This results from our efforts to make higher-speed options available to customers. That said, roughly 3/4 of our base of residential broadband customers remain at the basic speed tier, so we still have substantial runway to migrate the majority of our customers to higher-speed tiers and to drive higher revenue.
I'm also very pleased to report that SME revenue was stable sequentially in Q1, excluding CPE and Connecticut. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of stability in SME. We exclude CPE because it tends to be very uneven from quarter-to-quarter, and we exclude Connecticut revenue because it had a large sequential step-up as a result of the Q1 period being the first full quarter of contribution. Based on our 5 months of Connecticut experience so far through March, the SME trend in the state has been stable, and we are optimistic about the potential going forward.
Looking more broadly at Connecticut. We completed our first full quarter of operations and took actions that, we believe, will promote our long-term success. In the quarter, we allowed a significant percentage of the Connecticut bundle customers who were no longer under contract to migrate to our current promotion. This is consistent with our normal practices but was not the practice in Connecticut previously. As a result, we did experience an impact to Connecticut residential revenue in the quarter. In addition, when a customer's AT&T promotions were scheduled to expire, we chose to continue the promotional price in order to shield the customer from a price increase. As of the end of March, we have begun migrating these customers to market pricing, and we expect this to have a positive impact on ARPC and residential revenues in Q2 and future periods. Our goal was to start our relationships with these customers on the right foot, and we believe it was the correct long-term choice for the business. These actions were concentrated in the months of January and February. Now that we have moved to a more normal customer-based management strategy, I am pleased with the trends and the results. For instance, in March, we experienced stabilization across all revenue segments and growth in some key areas. Based on what we've seen so far, these favorable trends continued in April, and we are confident that our execution plan is succeeding.
To recap, these actions impacted only Connecticut residential customers and revenue and were isolated to Q1 in the month of January and February. Already in March and April, we have moved back to a more normal revenue trajectory, and we feel good about the trend going forward.
With respect to Connecticut profitability, the results are strong with expenses lower as we apply the Frontier go-to-market philosophy and cost structures to these operations. Comparing the current level of OpEx of the Connecticut properties with the same period in 2014 shows we have reduced operating expense levels in excess of $230 million annually. This exceeds our original forecast, and we continue to develop additional synergy targets as we continue to operate the acquired system in our Frontier ecosystems. As a result, the contribution to EBITDA due to Connecticut operations continues to be very strong, despite the residential revenue declines we experienced in the beginning of Q1.
Let me now give you an update on the Verizon transaction. We have made significant progress with our integration planning activities and are on track with the milestones we outlined when we announced the deal in February. We have assembled a very strong integration planning team consisting of leaders with diverse skills and whose collective experience in this type of integration is truly unparalleled. We are working on functional gap identification and remediation. Our team remains confident in our ability to complete the conversion and integration in the time frame we have identified. We have begun the approval process, filing applications with regulatory authorities at the federal and state level. We are fully engaged with the commission staff and various parties in both approval processes. We remain very optimistic that we will be successful on all fronts. We'll provide additional feedback on progress as we meet key milestones and in our ongoing investor calls. We remain very excited about the benefits of the Verizon transaction for our customers and our shareholders. As we have previously stated, this transaction continues a fundamental transformation of Frontier that really commenced with our 2010 Verizon transaction.
Please turn to Slide 6. In 2009, only 30% of our revenue was data and video, with voice and regulatory comprising the remaining 70%. After the completion of the current Verizon transaction, this mix will be dramatically improved. We anticipate that data and video will comprise 55%, with voice and regulatory now constituting a declining and less significant portion and, of course, we will also have substantially greater scale. At the same time, we will continue to maintain our industry-leading margins. These high margins result from our intense focus on operational efficiency, the benefits on increased scale and our ability to transition these properties to the Frontier cost structure. The combination of these items will allow us to achieve our synergy target of $700 million per year by our third year of ownership.
Please turn to Slide 7. For these reasons, we see the Verizon acquisition as a transformative opportunity that will meaningfully enhance Frontier's long-term competitive position, diversify our business and significantly increase shareholder value. We estimate that the completion of this transaction will provide 35% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will improve our dividend payout ratio by an estimated 13 percentage points. 
We plan to raise capital to fund the acquisition. We anticipate raising approximately $3 billion in equity or equity-linked securities, followed by an approximately $7.9 billion in debt. We have planned our financing such that the resulting capital structure will maintain our current debt ratings. We'll be opportunistic in completing our equity and debt raises, with a goal of completing them in the Q3 to Q4 time frame, in advance of the estimated first half of 2016 closing of this transaction.
As most of you know, on April 3, we completed a smooth, well-planned CEO transition. Maggie Wilderotter has become Executive Chairman, and I'm very honored and pleased to have the opportunity to serve as Frontier's CEO. Having witnessed the growth and transformation of our company over the last 25 years, I believe the company is at its brightest point in my career, and our team is excited about the future. I would like to thank Maggie for her vision, her dedication and her strong support during the last 10.5 years.
Finally, turning to Slide 8. Let me say a few words about my vision for Frontier. First, retaining customers will be at the top of my list of priorities. The first step in growing our business is to retain our existing customers. We will move to a more balanced approach to acquisition and retention with a laser focus on retaining our customers. 
Second, we will grow broadband market share. This will be in both residential and commercial segments. We continue to focus on diversifying distribution channels and utilizing speed, simplicity and choice to differentiate in our markets. We'll continue to invest in our networks to enable speed and capacity. In this regard, let me update you on a key development on Connect America Fund II. In the last week, we received notification from the SEC that we are eligible to receive $283 million in CAF II support. This will allow us to invest in underserved as well as unserved areas. This reflects approximately $133 million of additional funding more than our current support levels. We were reviewing the support on a state-by-state basis and expect to accept the majority of the funds. Until we complete that review and determine the deployment schedule for 2015, we are maintaining our current guidance for leveraged free cash flow and CapEx. We are pleased with this development and will be an important component of our broadband strategy. 
Third, commercial sales offers us a growth opportunity. We've spent the last 4 years enhancing our network, adding partners and distribution channels and upgrading our information systems. We are now poised to leverage all of these investments, and you have already begun to see the results in 5 quarters of SME revenue stability. This area remains one of our top opportunities, and we will continue to pursue it relentlessly. 
And fourth, video in all flavors will be incredibly important to our success. Following the integration of the Verizon assets in 2016, we will have close to 1.8 million video customers in all categories, more than triple our current number. This enhanced scale, together with exciting advancements in technology, will create tremendous new opportunities for Frontier.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier reported a loss per share of $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 compared to earnings per share of $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusting for acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs and severance costs, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2014. The board declared a dividend payment of $0.105 per share for the second quarter of 2015, in line with the increased dividend in the first quarter.
Please turn to Slide 9. First quarter revenue was $1.37 billion, which includes $264 million of revenue from the inclusion of the first full quarter of Connecticut. This represents a quarterly sequential decline of 0.7%, excluding Connecticut, an improvement as compared to the 2.3% sequential -- quarterly sequential decline in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Total customer revenue of $1.2 billion includes $254 million of revenue from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, customer revenue declined by $16 million or 1.6% as compared to the fourth quarter. However, taking into account the anticipated and previously discussed decline in wireless backhaul revenue, the rate of quarterly customer revenue decline improved in our legacy footprint from negative 1.8% sequentially in the fourth quarter of '14 down to negative 1.3% in the first quarter.
Total residential customer revenue of $617 million included $138 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the residential customer revenue trend improved sequentially with a decline in Q1 of only $6 million as compared to $13 million decline in Q4 '14. Residential data revenue increased 10% over the prior year, partially offsetting a decline in voice revenue. Including Connecticut, residential data revenue increased by nearly 2.5% sequentially -- pardon me, nearly 5% sequentially.
Customer revenue -- business customer revenue of $616 million included $116 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the $10 million sequential decline was primarily a result of voice declines and the expected step-down in wireless backhaul revenue. We continue to be encouraged by the trends we are seeing in SME, as Dan discussed.
Total data and Internet services revenue increased $20 million sequentially, with the first quarter -- with a full quarter impact of our Connecticut operations. The legacy operation showed a modest increase with our data services growth outstripping the non-switched revenue declines. The drivers of growth in data services included 10% year-over-year increase in residential data service and a 20% year-over-year increase in business Ethernet services, for a total year-over-year quarterly increase of nearly 12%, excluding our Connecticut operations. We continue to anticipate that Frontier's data services revenue should grow and increase as a percentage of overall mix, excluding the wireless backhaul headwinds.
Excluding Connecticut, total voice revenue was down sequentially, although an improvement in the quarterly sequential rate of decline from Q4 '14, again, reflecting the industry secular headwinds of declining voice customers. This decline was offset by the incremental revenue from Connecticut.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $138 million, and excluding Connecticut, this improved $9 million sequentially.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $64.13 for the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.3% sequentially. As Dan discussed, this was due to the price migration of certain Connecticut bundled customers who moved to Frontier's pricing bundles. We have seen this migration level off in March and April and are already seeing monthly sequential stable trends early on in the second quarter.
Business ARPC was down 1.5% sequentially, with the wireless backhaul being a factor in this decline. ARPC for SME was stable sequentially, illustrating stable trends in both legacy and Connecticut operations.
The adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 41.1%. Our margins continued to lead the way in our telecom cable sector with our relentless focus on expense management and continuous operational improvements.
Cash operating expenses in our legacy footprint declined 1% in the first quarter as compared to Q4 '14, and we're nearly flat year-over-year as compared to Q1 '14 despite an increased headcount to support our Frontier Secure strategic partnership service offering. We have achieved the annualized cost synergies in the Connecticut acquisition of $230 million as of the end of the first quarter, exceeding our $200 million target for synergies and far earlier than our original timing of year 3.
Capital expenditures were $170 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $10 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Further, our CAF-funded expenditures in Q1 were $9 million. Since inception, we have expended $103 million of the $133 million CAF Phase 1 funds received, enabling our operating broadband service to 188,700 households today, including an incremental 24,700 households within this past quarter. We currently anticipate completing our CAF I obligations in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $197 million in the first quarter, and we are on track for our full year guidance range of $785 million to $825 million. First quarter cash tax payments were $17 million. Our trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 54%.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.85x, in line with our estimates when we first announced the transaction. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and credit availability. We've repaid debt of $129 million in the first quarter. Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio over time. We are comfortable with our leverage levels and are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
Slide 12 contains our debt maturity profile as of the end of the first quarter. Since the close of the first quarter, we have repaid an additional $97 million in maturing debt obligations.
Please turn to Slide 13. Our guidance for 2015 remains unchanged as follows: leveraged free cash flow is estimated to be in the range of $785 million to $825 million; capital expenditures, excluding those related to CAF spending, are estimated to be $650 million to $700 million; and cash taxes are estimated to be $175 million to $200 million. This guidance excludes spending related to acquisition and integration expenses. We will update our guidance after our decisions are finalized regarding CAF II.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2015 operating results, the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and our expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

Can you provide more color on the expenses that you had in the quarter, if there were any one-timers? Or what drove that higher spending? And second question on the churn. It picked up a little bit in the first quarter. You did mention that, in Connecticut, you went to market pricing in March. Was that the main cause of the uptick in churn?

And then the part on our own system was really caused when we went through Connecticut conversion. We did have some hiccups that we talked about on previous calls. So we had a slightly higher churn level in January and February. That really did mitigate quite a bit in March and has come down to normal levels in April. We absolutely believe that migrating customers to the right price point in the market improves the characteristics of that customer relationship, and we -- we're doing that every single day, and we think it's the right decision for the business for the long term."

So first off, you should think about -- when I think about Connecticut and the impact it's had on the business, first of all, the commercial side of the business in Connecticut has been very stable. We're very pleased with the results that we're experiencing there. We think there's a lot of opportunity in Connecticut, and it just takes a little while to start to tap into that opportunity as you build your sales channels and build the relationships between our sales force and the customers in the market. You really can't accelerate that too quickly. It's really building those relationships over time. Really, a lot of the noise that occurred was around the residential customers. And the residential customers, there were a couple of things that we did in the quarter that both allowed customers to move to market-based pricing, but we also purposely held rates on promotions from increasing. We did not want customers to have a rate increase right in their first bill or second bill with us as the provider and then have to call in during a period of high call volumes because that would be a bad experience for customers. So we implemented a program of migrating those customers, really starting towards the end of March with a very thorough communication plan and giving them insight into what their new bill would be as well as the opportunity if they wanted to change plans moving forward. We've had very good experience with that, so I don't see a lot more choppiness from migrations moving forward. We've kind of steadied out. There was a big backlog, for lack of a better way of describing it, since AT&T had stopped doing marketing and really had a different approach to allowing customers to migrate to acquisition-type offers. And in our case, acquisition offers are kind of our everyday pricing in the market. So there was about 4 or 5 months of backlog that occurred just prior to conversion and then up through January and February. We worked through that, so I don't think you'll see any more of that and should start to see a stabilization as we exit Q1 and into Q2."

In all scenarios that we envision right now, this would be a very positive benefit for us, and we would see incremental benefit to the tune of $100 million to $133 million approximately, depending upon whether we take all of the support to our current frozen support level.

We saw some strong results. We took market share in 77% of the markets across the country. I think if there was anything that slowed down our total broadband additions, it's simply that during the first quarter, we still rely on our contact centers for about 60% in any quarter of our broadband additions. And as you go through a large integration as we did, those high call volumes tend to disrupt our universal cues around the country. And as a result, it impacted our gross additions across the country, quite frankly, by a few thousand. But I would say that, in general, we still are very bullish on the legacy markets.

What we can say is that we had customers that we're migrating downwards in monthly recurring pricing during January and February. It actually swung the other way when we went to March, and now when we went from March to April is that, that pricing actually started to migrate upwards. And we saw new customers coming on toward the end of the quarter in the months at higher price points than where they were in January and February. So we're seeing a flow -- a good flow-through as we go in to the second quarter, so I'll just say I think we feel pretty good about Q2 in Connecticut."

We are very pleased to report on another quarter of solid results in our continuing business, the successful completion of our first full quarter in Connecticut and good progress toward the completion of our transformative Verizon acquisition.
Let's begin on Slide 5. We added more than 17,100 net new broadband customers in the first quarter. This represents our ninth consecutive quarter of robust broadband growth. Our strong execution in broadband continued to be broadly based across our footprint. We took residential broadband share in 77% of our markets in Q1. 44% of broadband activity in the first quarter was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits, which represents another quarter of progress from the 40% of activity in Q4 and a dramatic improvement from the mid-teens level of 2 years ago. This results from our efforts to make higher-speed options available to customers. That said, roughly 3/4 of our base of residential broadband customers remain at the basic speed tier, so we still have substantial runway to migrate the majority of our customers to higher-speed tiers and to drive higher revenue.
I'm also very pleased to report that SME revenue was stable sequentially in Q1, excluding CPE and Connecticut. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of stability in SME. We exclude CPE because it tends to be very uneven from quarter-to-quarter, and we exclude Connecticut revenue because it had a large sequential step-up as a result of the Q1 period being the first full quarter of contribution. Based on our 5 months of Connecticut experience so far through March, the SME trend in the state has been stable, and we are optimistic about the potential going forward.
Looking more broadly at Connecticut. We completed our first full quarter of operations and took actions that, we believe, will promote our long-term success. In the quarter, we allowed a significant percentage of the Connecticut bundle customers who were no longer under contract to migrate to our current promotion. This is consistent with our normal practices but was not the practice in Connecticut previously. As a result, we did experience an impact to Connecticut residential revenue in the quarter. In addition, when a customer's AT&T promotions were scheduled to expire, we chose to continue the promotional price in order to shield the customer from a price increase. As of the end of March, we have begun migrating these customers to market pricing, and we expect this to have a positive impact on ARPC and residential revenues in Q2 and future periods. Our goal was to start our relationships with these customers on the right foot, and we believe it was the correct long-term choice for the business. These actions were concentrated in the months of January and February. Now that we have moved to a more normal customer-based management strategy, I am pleased with the trends and the results. For instance, in March, we experienced stabilization across all revenue segments and growth in some key areas. Based on what we've seen so far, these favorable trends continued in April, and we are confident that our execution plan is succeeding.
To recap, these actions impacted only Connecticut residential customers and revenue and were isolated to Q1 in the month of January and February. Already in March and April, we have moved back to a more normal revenue trajectory, and we feel good about the trend going forward.
With respect to Connecticut profitability, the results are strong with expenses lower as we apply the Frontier go-to-market philosophy and cost structures to these operations. Comparing the current level of OpEx of the Connecticut properties with the same period in 2014 shows we have reduced operating expense levels in excess of $230 million annually. This exceeds our original forecast, and we continue to develop additional synergy targets as we continue to operate the acquired system in our Frontier ecosystems. As a result, the contribution to EBITDA due to Connecticut operations continues to be very strong, despite the residential revenue declines we experienced in the beginning of Q1.
Let me now give you an update on the Verizon transaction. We have made significant progress with our integration planning activities and are on track with the milestones we outlined when we announced the deal in February. We have assembled a very strong integration planning team consisting of leaders with diverse skills and whose collective experience in this type of integration is truly unparalleled. We are working on functional gap identification and remediation. Our team remains confident in our ability to complete the conversion and integration in the time frame we have identified. We have begun the approval process, filing applications with regulatory authorities at the federal and state level. We are fully engaged with the commission staff and various parties in both approval processes. We remain very optimistic that we will be successful on all fronts. We'll provide additional feedback on progress as we meet key milestones and in our ongoing investor calls. We remain very excited about the benefits of the Verizon transaction for our customers and our shareholders. As we have previously stated, this transaction continues a fundamental transformation of Frontier that really commenced with our 2010 Verizon transaction.
Please turn to Slide 6. In 2009, only 30% of our revenue was data and video, with voice and regulatory comprising the remaining 70%. After the completion of the current Verizon transaction, this mix will be dramatically improved. We anticipate that data and video will comprise 55%, with voice and regulatory now constituting a declining and less significant portion and, of course, we will also have substantially greater scale. At the same time, we will continue to maintain our industry-leading margins. These high margins result from our intense focus on operational efficiency, the benefits on increased scale and our ability to transition these properties to the Frontier cost structure. The combination of these items will allow us to achieve our synergy target of $700 million per year by our third year of ownership.
Please turn to Slide 7. For these reasons, we see the Verizon acquisition as a transformative opportunity that will meaningfully enhance Frontier's long-term competitive position, diversify our business and significantly increase shareholder value. We estimate that the completion of this transaction will provide 35% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will improve our dividend payout ratio by an estimated 13 percentage points. 
We plan to raise capital to fund the acquisition. We anticipate raising approximately $3 billion in equity or equity-linked securities, followed by an approximately $7.9 billion in debt. We have planned our financing such that the resulting capital structure will maintain our current debt ratings. We'll be opportunistic in completing our equity and debt raises, with a goal of completing them in the Q3 to Q4 time frame, in advance of the estimated first half of 2016 closing of this transaction.
As most of you know, on April 3, we completed a smooth, well-planned CEO transition. Maggie Wilderotter has become Executive Chairman, and I'm very honored and pleased to have the opportunity to serve as Frontier's CEO. Having witnessed the growth and transformation of our company over the last 25 years, I believe the company is at its brightest point in my career, and our team is excited about the future. I would like to thank Maggie for her vision, her dedication and her strong support during the last 10.5 years.
Finally, turning to Slide 8. Let me say a few words about my vision for Frontier. First, retaining customers will be at the top of my list of priorities. The first step in growing our business is to retain our existing customers. We will move to a more balanced approach to acquisition and retention with a laser focus on retaining our customers. 
Second, we will grow broadband market share. This will be in both residential and commercial segments. We continue to focus on diversifying distribution channels and utilizing speed, simplicity and choice to differentiate in our markets. We'll continue to invest in our networks to enable speed and capacity. In this regard, let me update you on a key development on Connect America Fund II. In the last week, we received notification from the SEC that we are eligible to receive $283 million in CAF II support. This will allow us to invest in underserved as well as unserved areas. This reflects approximately $133 million of additional funding more than our current support levels. We are reviewing the support on a state-by-state basis and expect to accept the majority of the funds. Until we complete that review and determine the deployment schedule for 2015, we are maintaining our current guidance for leveraged free cash flow and CapEx. We are pleased with this development and will be an important component of our broadband strategy. 
Third, commercial sales offers us a growth opportunity. We've spent the last 4 years enhancing our network, adding partners and distribution channels and upgrading our information systems. We are now poised to leverage all of these investments, and you have already begun to see the results in 5 quarters of SME revenue stability. This area remains one of our top opportunities, and we will continue to pursue it relentlessly. 
And fourth, video in all flavors will be incredibly important to our success. Following the integration of the Verizon assets in 2016, we will have close to 1.8 million video customers in all categories, more than triple our current number. This enhanced scale, together with exciting advancements in technology, will create tremendous new opportunities for Frontier.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Total customer revenue of $1.2 billion includes $254 million of revenue from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, customer revenue declined by $16 million or 1.6% as compared to the fourth quarter. However, taking into account the anticipated and previously discussed decline in wireless backhaul revenue, the rate of quarterly customer revenue decline improved in our legacy footprint from negative 1.8% sequentially in the fourth quarter of '14 down to negative 1.3% in the first quarter.
Total residential customer revenue of $617 million included $138 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the residential customer revenue trend improved sequentially with a decline in Q1 of only $6 million as compared to $13 million decline in Q4 '14. Residential data revenue increased 10% over the prior year, partially offsetting a decline in voice revenue. Including Connecticut, residential data revenue increased by nearly 2.5% sequentially -- pardon me, nearly 5% sequentially.
Customer revenue -- business customer revenue of $616 million included $116 million from Connecticut. Excluding Connecticut, the $10 million sequential decline was primarily a result of voice declines and the expected step-down in wireless backhaul revenue. We continue to be encouraged by the trends we are seeing in SME, as Dan discussed.
Total data and Internet services revenue increased $20 million sequentially, with the first quarter -- with a full quarter impact of our Connecticut operations. The legacy operation showed a modest increase with our data services growth outstripping the non-switched revenue declines. The drivers of growth in data services included 10% year-over-year increase in residential data service and a 20% year-over-year increase in business Ethernet services, for a total year-over-year quarterly increase of nearly 12%, excluding our Connecticut operations. We continue to anticipate that Frontier's data services revenue should grow and increase as a percentage of overall mix, excluding the wireless backhaul headwinds.
Excluding Connecticut, total voice revenue was down sequentially, although an improvement in the quarterly sequential rate of decline from Q4 '14, again, reflecting the industry secular headwinds of declining voice customers. This decline was offset by the incremental revenue from Connecticut.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $138 million, and excluding Connecticut, this improved $9 million sequentially.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $64.13 for the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.3% sequentially. As Dan discussed, this was due to the price migration of certain Connecticut bundled customers who moved to Frontier's pricing bundles. We have seen this migration level off in March and April and are already seeing monthly sequential stable trends early on in the second quarter.
Business ARPC was down 1.5% sequentially, with the wireless backhaul being a factor in this decline. ARPC for SME was stable sequentially, illustrating stable trends in both legacy and Connecticut operations.
The adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 41.1%. Our margins continued to lead the way in our telecom cable sector with our relentless focus on expense management and continuous operational improvements.
Cash operating expenses in our legacy footprint declined 1% in the first quarter as compared to Q4 '14, and we're nearly flat year-over-year as compared to Q1 '14 despite an increased headcount to support our Frontier Secure strategic partnership service offering. We have achieved the annualized cost synergies in the Connecticut acquisition of $230 million as of the end of the first quarter, exceeding our $200 million target for synergies and far earlier than our original timing of year 3.
Capital expenditures were $170 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $10 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Further, our CAF-funded expenditures in Q1 were $9 million. Since inception, we have expended $103 million of the $133 million CAF Phase 1 funds received, enabling our operating broadband service to 188,700 households today, including an incremental 24,700 households within this past quarter. We currently anticipate completing our CAF I obligations in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $197 million in the first quarter, and we are on track for our full year guidance range of $785 million to $825 million. First quarter cash tax payments were $17 million. Our trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 54%.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.85x, in line with our estimates when we first announced the transaction. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and credit availability. We've repaid debt of $129 million in the first quarter. Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio over time. We are comfortable with our leverage levels and are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
Slide 12 contains our debt maturity profile as of the end of the first quarter. Since the close of the first quarter, we have repaid an additional $97 million in maturing debt obligations.
Please turn to Slide 13. Our guidance for 2015 remains unchanged as follows: leveraged free cash flow is estimated to be in the range of $785 million to $825 million; capital expenditures, excluding those related to CAF spending, are estimated to be $650 million to $700 million; and cash taxes are estimated to be $175 million to $200 million. This guidance excludes spending related to acquisition and integration expenses. We will update our guidance after our decisions are finalized regarding CAF II.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2015 operating results, the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and our expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

It picked up a little bit in the first quarter. You did mention that, in Connecticut, you went to market pricing in March. Was that the main cause of the uptick in churn?

And then the part on our own system was really caused when we went through Connecticut conversion. We did have some hiccups that we talked about on previous calls. So we had a slightly higher churn level in January and February. That really did mitigate quite a bit in March and has come down to normal levels in April. We absolutely believe that migrating customers to the right price point in the market improves the characteristics of that customer relationship, and we -- we're doing that every single day, and we think it's the right decision for the business for the long term."

So first off, you should think about -- when I think about Connecticut and the impact it's had on the business, first of all, the commercial side of the business in Connecticut has been very stable. We're very pleased with the results that we're experiencing there. We think there's a lot of opportunity in Connecticut, and it just takes a little while to start to tap into that opportunity as you build your sales channels and build the relationships between our sales force and the customers in the market. You really can't accelerate that too quickly. It's really building those relationships over time. Really, a lot of the noise that occurred was around the residential customers. And the residential customers, there were a couple of things that we did in the quarter that both allowed customers to move to market-based pricing, but we also purposely held rates on promotions from increasing. We did not want customers to have a rate increase right in their first bill or second bill with us as the provider and then have to call in during a period of high call volumes because that would be a bad experience for customers. So we implemented a program of migrating those customers, really starting towards the end of March with a very thorough communication plan and giving them insight into what their new bill would be as well as the opportunity if they wanted to change plans moving forward. We've had very good experience with that, so I don't see a lot more choppiness from migrations moving forward. We've kind of steadied out. There was a big backlog, for lack of a better way of describing it, since AT&T had stopped doing marketing and really had a different approach to allowing customers to migrate to acquisition-type offers. And in our case, acquisition offers are kind of our everyday pricing in the market. So there was about 4 or 5 months of backlog that occurred just prior to conversion and then up through January and February. We've worked through that, so I don't think you'll see any more of that and should start to see a stabilization as we exit Q1 and into Q2."

In all scenarios that we envision right now, this would be a very positive benefit for us, and we would see incremental benefit to the tune of $100 million to $133 million approximately, depending upon whether we take all of the support to our current frozen support level.

One, I'm just wondering whether you guys would be willing to share or quantify what the impact of migrating to current -- to your current promotion was in Connecticut versus where they were before. Is there any way to quantify that in dollar terms? Just a quick clarification on that topic as well. You talked about extending the AT&T promotional pricing and begin moving that to Frontier towards the end of the quarter. By the end of April, are all those customers going to be off of AT&T promotional pricing and on to your pricing? And then maybe last one for Dan. Just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of broadband, maybe how things stacked up in legacy versus Connecticut market this quarter and what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint."

So on your question on extending the AT&T offers, at the -- we started the process on March 25. And as we'll finish all the bill cycles at the end of April, all of those customers will have been moved to the correct pricing. So we should see the benefit of that as we come into our April results. And then on the marketplace discussion, Scott, I would say the legacy market still seem very attractive to us. We saw some strong results. We took market share in 77% of the markets across the country. I think if there was anything that slowed down our total broadband additions, it's simply that during the first quarter, we still rely on our contact centers for about 60% in any quarter of our broadband additions. And as you go through a large integration as we did, those high call volumes tend to disrupt our universal cues around the country. And as a result, it impacted our gross additions across the country, quite frankly, by a few thousand. But I would say that, in general, we still are very bullish on the legacy markets. And we look forward to the investments that we're going to make in Connecticut to expand and extend U-verse as well as upgrade the U-verse capabilities as well as upgrade the more traditional DSL services. And all of those costs to do that are in our commitments to the state of Connecticut and in our guidance for this year."

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I am very pleased with second quarter results. Growing customer revenue, delivering strong broadband net additions and stabilizing Connecticut residential revenue were all highlights. We have also made substantial progress in the announced acquisition of the Verizon properties in California, Texas and Florida and finalized our plans for utilizing Connect America Funds to transform unserved and underserved areas in our footprint.
I will review our Q2 performance and discuss our plans for the remainder of the year as well as our deployment plans for CAF II.
Please turn to Slide 5. We achieved sequential growth in customer revenue in the second quarter. This reflects both stabilization in Connecticut and growth in our legacy Frontier footprint. Actions taken towards the end of the first quarter stabilized Connecticut residential customer migrations to lower-cost packages. That trend continued through the second quarter and through July. In other words, we've experienced 5 consecutive months of stability, and we are confident that the migration pressure that impacted Q1 will not reoccur in the remainder of the year. In addition, the Connecticut customers that migrated in early Q1 will see their promotional pricing expire in early 2016, offering an opportunity to return to more normal ARPC levels.
Second quarter net broadband additions were more than 29,200. This represents our 10th consecutive quarter of robust broadband growth, even though the second quarter is seasonally softer as full year's end. Once again, this quarter our success has been broadly based. We have gained residential broadband share in over 75% of our markets year-to-date, illustrating that our go-to-market approach continues to resonate. In addition, our alternate distribution channels have produced great results in both the residential and commercial segments.
We continue to see more customers choose higher-speed broadband products. In the second quarter, 45% of the broadband activity was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits. With about 75% of our broadband customers still utilizing our basic speed tier, we have a substantial opportunity to improve our average revenue per customer as they upgrade their Internet service to higher speeds over time. This illustrates the benefits delivered by ongoing network investments. Going forward, we will continue to expand speed and capacities. We will also focus on improving our operational support systems to make it easier for customers to self-serve and manage the use of our products.
Revenues from small, medium and enterprise were a bright spot. The second quarter marked our 6th consecutive quarter of stable SME revenue in legacy markets. In Connecticut, SME revenue grew slightly from Q1 levels. We see ample opportunity to further penetrate this segment throughout the country as we continue to build our sales distribution networks.
Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with these results. We have seen success in selling Ethernet-based products to all segments of the commercial base. In addition, we have made excellent progress in closing sales with many municipalities for next-gen 911 systems. This will yield benefits in the coming quarters and cement long-term relationships that will survive for many years.
Over the last few years, we have made substantial investments to enhance our Ethernet capabilities for both the wholesale and retail markets. These investments have produced strong year-over-year double-digit growth in our Ethernet service revenue. This growth, coupled with strong performance in all our commercial sales distribution channels, more than offset the headwinds we continue to experience in wireless backhaul segment. Wireless backhaul is now down to about 4% of our total revenue, so this will have less impact on our business in the future.
In July, we accepted $283 million in annual CAF II funding. This was the full amount for which we were eligible. We have been busy planning this deployment to maximize impact in the limited construction season left in 2015. This efforts will commence in August and will continue until the close of our construction season in October. John will cover the financial aspects of CAF II shortly. In summary, we are very excited about this program and believe it offers an opportunity to change lives and build value for our shareholders.
Turning to the Verizon transaction. We made substantial progress in the second quarter. In June, we completed our equity offering, raising $2.75 billion in common and preferred equity. We appreciate the confidence our new investors have placed in us as well as the additional commitment many of you made during this equity offering. This was a very significant element of our funding for the acquisition and was necessary to complete prior to moving forward with our debt offerings. John will cover this further in his presentation.
Our integration teams are working diligently to finalize network cutover plans and to identify customer experience gaps for remediation. We have already completed a great deal of the work. The conversion efforts are all going well with no material obstacles identified. From a regulatory standpoint, we expect to receive a limited approval needed for Texas shortly. The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a case schedule that would yield a final approval by the end of December. Under this schedule, we have been meeting with various community leaders and organizations throughout California to understand their perspectives. In addition, the CPUC is holding 11 public comment sections throughout the state. These sessions will be completed over the next several weeks. Importantly, we reached an agreement with the unions that represent the workers in these states. This was a win-win for all involved. The unions are now enthusiastically supporting approval at the state and federal level. On the federal side, we continue to work with the SEC to explain the benefits of this transaction for customers. We remain confident that we will receive SEC approval in the second half of the year. And therefore, we are now targeting a close date of March 31, 2016.
Please turn to Slide 6. The Verizon acquisition will transform Frontier. As you can see from the pie charts on this slide, with the addition of the Verizon markets, residential voice revenues will constitute less than 20% of Frontier's pro forma revenue based on 2014 run rates. Likewise, wireless backhaul revenues from the continuing Frontier territories will comprise only about 2% of overall revenues, making any future declines less consequential. We will also gain a substantially enlarged FiOS footprint and much greater scale. This transaction increases Frontier's growth profile and reduces our exposure to declining portions of our business, improving our business mix significantly. Another benefit of this transaction is the technology refresh that we will enjoy for our existing FiOS markets. We are currently finalizing our plans to introduce this new technology in these FiOS markets in Q4. The new FiOS platform and existing Verizon pricing and bundles will become the new standard for our current FiOS markets later this year. This will allow us to have 3 to 6 months of operation of the refreshed platform prior to integration of the new states. We will utilize this time to get our team very comfortable with the new features, functionality and business processes needed to support the current FiOS platform. And then we will continue the exact Verizon pricing and bundle construction in the new markets following conversion. As a result, we will not see the migration impact we saw in Connecticut in Q1. This conversion change will reduce training requirements of transferring employees, maintain the effectiveness of alternate channel partners and, most importantly, prevent the possibility of revenue decline associated with bundle migration as we experienced in Connecticut. We continue to anticipate significant synergies as we substitute Frontier's lower cost structure for Verizon's. The Frontier team is working to deliver at or above synergies and EBITDA levels that we have communicated. The key driver of our synergies is the elimination of the Verizon expense allocations. As we approach the midpoint of our integration efforts, we remain highly confident in delivering on pro forma financial projections. We continue to estimate that the completion of Verizon transaction will provide over 30% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will result in a solid improvement to our dividend payout ratio.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier reported a loss per share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss per share of $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 and earnings of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusting for acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration cost, severance cost and certain tax benefit items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On July 29, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2015, payable September 30, in line with the dividend rate of the first and second quarters. We will also be paying the first dividend on our newly issued preferred shares on September 30.
Please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter revenue was $1.37 billion. Total Connecticut revenue of $264 million was stable sequentially as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Customer revenue of $1.2 billion was up $3 million sequentially or 0.3%. This represents a very strong result, particularly considering that wireless backhaul revenue declined. Excluding the decline in wireless backhaul revenue, customer revenue would have been up 0.6% sequentially. Total residential customer revenue of $615 million included a $3 million sequential increase in our legacy operations, offset by a $5 million decline in Connecticut, which we previously anticipated within our discussion of Q1 results with respect to pricing migrations. Within our legacy footprint, quarterly residential data revenue increased more than 10% over the prior year. Further, residential data revenue increased by nearly 2.6% sequentially over Q1, inclusive of Connecticut. Notwithstanding the slight quarterly sequential decline in Connecticut residential revenue, in each of the months in Q2, we achieved a higher level of revenue than March, the month in which we saw the largest revenue impact from the residential customer pricing migrations. The actions that we took in Connecticut in the latter part of Q1 have the intended positive impact. We expect this positive momentum to continue in the second half of this year.
Business customer revenue of $621 million was up $5 million sequentially. Growth in both SME and carrier wholesale more than offset the anticipated decline in wireless backhaul. The growth came in both our legacy and Connecticut operations.
Total data and Internet services revenue increased $9 million sequentially. Growth in data services outstrip the decline in non-switch revenue. Ethernet continues to grow at about a 20% annualized rate.
Voice revenue continued to decline as anticipated, reflecting the industry secular headwinds of declining voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $132 million, down $6 million sequentially. Excluding the amounts attributable to CAF I true-ups, regulatory revenue would've shown a slight increase in Q2 as compared to Q1.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $64.43 for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.5% sequentially. Business ARPC was up 1.6% sequentially. ARPC within SME was up sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 41%, which was stable with the first quarter. We continue to deliver margins above other companies in the sector with our relentless focus on expense management and continuous operational improvements.
Cash operating expenses were nearly unchanged versus Q1, despite an increase in headcount to support our Frontier Secure strategic partnership service offering.
Last quarter, we said we have achieved annualized cost synergies in the Connecticut acquisition of $230 million as of the end of the first quarter, exceeding our $200 million target for synergies and far earlier than our original timing of year 3. We continue to believe there are additional synergies we will realize above Connecticut and centralized support areas. As a result, we will be referencing them in the future as normal cost-reduction opportunities.
Capital expenditures were $178 million in the second quarter, and we spent an additional $28 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our CAF I expenditures in Q2 were $7 million. Since inception, we have been able to operate broadband service to 197,600 households, including an incremental 8,900 households within this quarter. We continue to anticipate completing our CAF I obligations in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 8. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $200 million in the second quarter. Our trailing 4-quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 55.6%. Note that the next quarter, you will begin to see our dividend payout ratio trend upwards as a result of our June equity raise. This increase will be temporary until we close the Verizon acquisition. Post closing, the cash flow from those states will return the payout ratio to normal levels. As we report our results in these intervening quarters, we'll call out the impact of the dilutive effects of the incremental shares issued in anticipation of the incremental financial benefit from this transaction.
Please turn to Slide 9. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.64x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and credit availability, excluding our restricted cash balance. We repaid debt of $121 million in the second quarter. We're in the process of closing a portion of the debt financing to support the Verizon transaction, which will further take out another layer of the temporary bridge facility. We have a broad window prior to the transaction closing to complete the remainder of the financing, allowing us to be opportunistic in our approach as we finish our capital raise.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged: Investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio over time. We are comfortable with the leverage levels we project for after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
We announced in June that Frontier has accepted all of the CAF II support allocated to us by the FCC. These funds will begin to flow to Frontier in the third quarter with a subsequent wind-down of our frozen USF support. Based upon our analysis and review, we intend to recognize this subsidy within our regulatory revenue as we receive the funds from the FCC, similar to our historical treatment of USF subsidy revenue.
Slide 10 prevents -- presents updated full year guidance for 2015. Our leveraged free cash flow is now a range of $825 million to $865 million. Capital expenditures will be within a range of $700 million to $750 million, and cash taxes are estimated at $95 million to $110 million. This leveraged free cash flow guidance reflects the CAF II subsidy revenue, including the full year 2015 true-up payment in excess of our previous frozen USF in the second half of '15, net of the incremental CapEx and cash tax impact. The updated capital expenditure guidance includes the additional spending for the CAF II program that we estimate incurring in 2015. Over the current 6-year plan life of this CAF II subsidy program, we anticipate that the CAF II subsidy revenue that we received in excess of the historical frozen USF support levels will be sufficient to cover the incremental CapEx necessary to reach the number of customer locations we are obligated to enable. As has been the case with our prior guidance numbers, this updated guidance excludes spending related to acquisition and integration expenses.
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2015 operating results, our progress with the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend. Moreover, the CAF II subsidy program creates a tremendous opportunity to enhance our network and residential capabilities in the states in which we operate and will provide an attractive financial return for our stakeholders, all while supporting the FCC's long-term objective of broadband availability.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

From a competitive perspective, we saw competition ramp up just as others did, but I think you could see we took shares despite that in Q2. We still feel very good about where we're positioned. So I think we're in a slightly different place than some of our peers who have existing markets that they've been operating for an extended period of time. We have still opportunity in both the CAF I as well as the areas that we had enabled following the first Verizon acquisition that continue to bear fruit for us, and we continue to see our offers resonate there.

And then point two, I think that you were saying that over the life of the program, over and above what you received in USF, that incremental amount of money will cover all the CapEx spending in order to meet the requirements. I think that was clarification number two. And then just on the last piece, on the bond deal that you're-- or debt financing that you're working on. I think one of the issues for the equity over the last little while is that there's been this feedback loop where the bond market anticipating a bond raise, so the bond yields go up, and that puts pressure in equity, and that informs opinion for the bond market.

The benefits that you see on ARPC were partially associated with that as well as customers moving to higher speeds and also customers taking our Frontier Secure product set. So it's a combination of all 3 of those. So as we look at the Verizon properties that we're acquiring, we will continue to pass through the content price hikes. We also will be pricing -- passing those through our legacy FiOS markets as well as Connecticut. You'll see us do that generally in the same time frame as most others in the first half of any calendar year. And as we look at the pricing that Verizon has in the market, again we'll be replicating that pricing in those markets towards the end of the year and rolling that out in our existing markets.

But wondering if you sort of strip out CAF II, if you could talk a little bit of what the trajectory for EBITDA might look like in the second half.

Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I'd say we had very solid results in the second quarter, both in legacy and Connecticut portions of the business. We're continuing to lay the groundwork and making progress towards completion of Verizon acquisition, and the entire company is intensely focused on increasing shareholder value, and we believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I am very pleased with second quarter results. Growing customer revenue, delivering strong broadband net additions and stabilizing Connecticut residential revenue were all highlights. We've also made substantial progress in the announced acquisition of the Verizon properties in California, Texas and Florida and finalized our plans for utilizing Connect America Funds to transform unserved and underserved areas in our footprint. I will review our Q2 performance and discuss our plans for the remainder of the year as well as our deployment plans for CAF II.
Please turn to Slide 5. We achieved sequential growth in customer revenue in the second quarter. This reflects both stabilization in Connecticut and growth in our legacy Frontier footprint. Actions taken towards the end of the first quarter stabilized Connecticut residential customer migrations to lower-cost packages. That trend continued through the second quarter and through July. In other words, we have experienced 5 consecutive months of stability, and we are confident that the migration pressure that impacted Q1 will not reoccur in the remainder of the year. In addition, the Connecticut customers that migrated in early Q1 will see their promotional pricing expire in early 2016, offering an opportunity to return to more normal ARPC levels.
Second quarter net broadband additions were more than 29,200. This represents our 10th consecutive quarter of robust broadband growth, even though the second quarter is seasonally softer as full years end. Once again, this quarter our success has been broadly based. We have gained residential broadband share in over 75% of our markets year-to-date, illustrating that our go-to-market approach continues to resonate. In addition, our alternate distribution channels have produced great results in both the residential and commercial segments.
We continue to see more customers choose higher-speed broadband products. In the second quarter, 45% of the broadband activity was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits. With about 75% of our broadband customers still utilizing our basic speed tier, we have a substantial opportunity to improve our average revenue per customer as they upgrade their Internet service to higher speeds over time. This illustrates the benefits delivered by ongoing network investments. Going forward, we will continue to expand speed and capacities. We will also focus on improving our operational support systems to make it easier for customers to self-serve and manage their use of our products.
Revenues from small, medium and enterprise were a bright spot. The second quarter marked our 6th consecutive quarter of stable SME revenue in legacy markets. In Connecticut, SME revenue grew slightly from Q1 levels. We see ample opportunity to further penetrate this segment throughout the country as we continue to build our sales distribution networks.
Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with these results. We have seen success in selling Ethernet-based products to all segments of the commercial base. In addition, we have made excellent progress in closing sales with many municipalities for next-gen 911 systems. This will yield benefits in the coming quarters and cement long-term relationships that will survive for many years.
Over the last few years, we have made substantial investments to enhance our Ethernet capabilities for both the wholesale and retail markets. These investments have produced strong year-over-year double-digit growth in our Ethernet service revenue. This growth, coupled with strong performance in all our commercial sales distribution channels, more than offset the headwinds we continue to experience in wireless backhaul segment. Wireless backhaul is now down to about 4% of our total revenue, so this will have less impact on our business in the future.
In July, we accepted $283 million in annual CAF II funding. This was the full amount for which we were eligible. We have been busy planning this deployment to maximize impact in the limited construction season left in 2015. These efforts will commence in August and will continue until the close of our construction season in October. John will cover the financial aspects of CAF II shortly. In summary, we are very excited about this program and believe it offers an opportunity to change lives and build value for our shareholders.
Turning to the Verizon transaction. We made substantial progress in the second quarter. In June, we completed our equity offering, raising $2.75 billion in common and preferred equity. We appreciate the confidence our new investors have placed in us as well as the additional commitment many of you made during this equity offering. This was a very significant element of our funding for the acquisition and was necessary to complete prior to moving forward with our debt offerings. John will cover this further in his presentation.
Our integration teams are working diligently to finalize network cutover plans and to identify customer experience gaps for remediation. We have already completed a great deal of the work. The conversion efforts are all going well with no material obstacles identified. 
From a regulatory standpoint, we expect to receive the limited approval needed for Texas shortly. The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a case schedule that would yield a final approval by the end of December. Under this schedule, we have been meeting with various community leaders and organizations throughout California to understand their perspectives. In addition, the CPUC is holding 11 public comment session throughout the state. These sessions will be completed over the next several weeks. 
Importantly, we reached an agreement with the unions that represent the workers in these states. This was a win-win for all involved. The unions are now enthusiastically supporting approval at the state and federal level. 
On the federal side, we continue to work with the SEC to explain the benefits of this transaction for customers. We remain confident that we will receive SEC approval in the second half of the year and, therefore, we are now targeting a close date of March 31, 2016.
Please turn to Slide 6. The Verizon acquisition will transform Frontier. As you can see from the pie charts on this slide, with the addition of the Verizon markets, residential voice revenues will constitute less than 20% of Frontier's pro forma revenue based on 2014 run rates. Likewise, wireless backhaul revenues from the continuing Frontier territories will comprise only about 2% of overall revenues, making any future declines less consequential. We will also gain a substantially enlarged FiOS footprint and much greater scale. This transaction increases Frontier's growth profile and reduces our exposure to declining portions of our business, improving our business mix significantly. Another benefit of this transaction is the technology refresh that we will enjoy for our existing FiOS markets. We are currently finalizing our plans to introduce this new technology in these FiOS markets in Q4. 
The new FiOS platform and existing Verizon pricing and bundles will become the new standard for our current FiOS markets later this year. This will allow us to have 3 to 6 months of operation of the refreshed platform prior to integration of the new states. We will utilize this time to get our team very comfortable with the new features, functionality and business processes needed to support the current FiOS platform. And then we will continue the exact Verizon pricing and bundle construction in the new markets following conversion. As a result, we will not see the migration impact we saw in Connecticut in Q1. This conversion change will reduce training requirements of transferring employees, maintain the effectiveness of alternate channel partners and, most importantly, prevent the possibility of revenue declines associated with bundle migration as we experienced in Connecticut. 
We continue to anticipate significant synergies as we substitute Frontier's lower-cost structure for Verizon's. The Frontier team is working to deliver at or above synergies and EBITDA levels that we have communicated. The key driver of our synergies is the elimination of the Verizon expense allocations. As we approach the midpoint of our integration efforts, we remain highly confident in delivering on pro forma financial projections. We continue to estimate that the completion of Verizon transaction will provide over 30% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will result in a solid improvement to our dividend payout ratio.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier reported a loss per share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss per share of $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 and earnings of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusting for acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax benefit items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On July 29, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2015, payable September 30, in line with the dividend rate of the first and second quarters. We will also be paying the first dividend on our newly issued preferred shares on September 30.
Please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter revenue was $1.37 billion. Total Connecticut revenue of $264 million was stable sequentially as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Customer revenue of $1.2 billion was up $3 million sequentially or 0.3%. This represents a very strong result, particularly considering that wireless backhaul revenue declined. Excluding the decline in wireless backhaul revenue, customer revenue would have been up 0.6% sequentially. Total residential customer revenue of $615 million included a $3 million sequential increase in our legacy operations, offset by a $5 million decline in Connecticut, which we previously anticipated within our discussion of Q1 results with respect to pricing migrations. Within our legacy footprint, quarterly residential data revenue increased more than 10% over the prior year. Further, residential data revenue increased by nearly 2.6% sequentially over Q1, inclusive of Connecticut. Notwithstanding the slight quarterly sequential decline in Connecticut residential revenue, in each of the months in Q2, we achieved a higher level of revenue than March, the month in which we saw the largest revenue impact from the residential customer pricing migrations. The actions that we took in Connecticut in the latter part of Q1 had the intended positive impact. We expect this positive momentum to continue in the second half of this year.
Business customer revenue of $621 million was up $5 million sequentially. Growth in both SME and carrier wholesale more than offset the anticipated decline in wireless backhaul. The growth came in both our legacy and Connecticut operations.
Total data and Internet services revenue increased $9 million sequentially. Growth in data services outstripped the decline in non-switched revenue. Ethernet continues to grow at about a 20% annualized rate.
Voice revenue continued to decline as anticipated, reflecting the industry secular headwinds of declining voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $132 million, down $6 million sequentially. Excluding the amounts attributable to CAF I true-ups, regulatory revenue would've shown a slight increase in Q2 as compared to Q1.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $64.43 for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.5% sequentially. Business ARPC was up 1.6% sequentially. ARPC within SME was up sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 41%, which was stable with the first quarter. We continue to deliver margins above other companies in the sector with our relentless focus on expense management and continuous operational improvements. Cash operating expenses were nearly unchanged versus Q1, despite an increase in headcount to support our Frontier Secure strategic partnership service offering.
Last quarter, we said we had achieved annualized cost synergies in the Connecticut acquisition of $230 million as of the end of the first quarter, exceeding our $200 million target for synergies and far earlier than our original timing of year 3. We continue to believe there are additional synergies we will realize in both Connecticut and centralized support areas. As a result, we will be referencing them in the future as normal cost-reduction opportunities.
Capital expenditures were $178 million in the second quarter, and we spent an additional $28 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our CAF I expenditures in Q2 were $7 million. Since inception, we have been able to operate a broadband service to 197,600 households, including an incremental 8,900 households within this past quarter. We continue to anticipate completing our CAF I obligations in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 8. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $200 million in the second quarter. Our trailing 4-quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 55.6%. Note that the next quarter, you will begin to see our dividend payout ratio trend upwards as a result of our June equity raise. This increase will be temporary until we close the Verizon acquisition. Post closing, the cash flow from those states will return the payout ratio to normal levels. As we report our results in these intervening quarters, we'll call out the impact of the dilutive effect of the incremental shares issued in anticipation of the incremental financial benefit from this transaction.
Please turn to Slide 9. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.64x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and credit availability, excluding our restricted cash balance. We repaid debt of $121 million in the second quarter. We're in the process of closing a portion of the debt financing to support the Verizon transaction, which will further take out another layer of the temporary bridge facility. We have a broad window prior to the transaction closing to complete the remainder of the financing, allowing us to be opportunistic in our approach as we finish our capital raise.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged: investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio over time. We are comfortable with the leverage levels we project for after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
We announced in June that Frontier has accepted all of the CAF II support allocated to us by the FCC. These funds will begin to flow to Frontier in the third quarter with a subsequent wind down of our frozen USF support. Based upon our analysis and review, we intend to recognize this subsidy within our regulatory revenue as we receive the funds from the FCC, similar to our historical treatment of USF subsidy revenue.
Slide 10 prevents -- presents updated full year guidance for 2015. Our leveraged free cash flow is now a range of $825 million to $865 million. Capital expenditures will be within a range of $700 million to $750 million, and cash taxes are estimated at $95 million to $110 million. This leveraged free cash flow guidance reflects the CAF II subsidy revenue, including the full year 2015 true-up payment in excess of our previous frozen USF in the second half of '15, net of the incremental CapEx and cash tax impact. The updated capital expenditure guidance includes the additional spending for the CAF II program that we estimate incurring in 2015. Over the current 6-year plan life of this CAF II subsidy program, we anticipate that the CAF II subsidy revenue that we receive in excess of the historical frozen USF support levels will be sufficient to cover the incremental CapEx necessary to reach the number of customer locations we are obligated to enable. As has been the case with our prior guidance numbers, this updated guidance excludes spending related to acquisition and integration expenses.
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2015 operating results, our progress with the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend. Moreover, the CAF II subsidy program creates a tremendous opportunity to enhance our network and residential capabilities in the states in which we operate and will provide an attractive financial return for our stakeholders, all while supporting the FCC's long-term objective of broadband availability.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

So number one, John, so just on the revenue recognition for CAF II, I guess, inasmuch as the CAF II funding is going to be a step-function increase in the regulatory receipts starting next quarter, is that what we should be modeling in, as a step-function increase in revenues starting in 3Q and going forward? And then I think you mentioned there weren't going to be a lot of additional expenses. So it kind of sounds like there's a step-function increase in EBITDA. That was kind of point one. And then point two, I think that you were saying that over the life of the program, over and above what you received in USF, that incremental amount of money will cover all the CapEx spending in order to meet the requirements. I think that was clarification number two. And then just on the last piece is, on the bond deal that you're -- or debt financing that you're working on. I think one of the issues for the equity over the last little while has been that there's been this feedback loop where the bond market's anticipating a bond raise, so the bond yields go up, and that puts pressure on equity, and that informs an opinion for the bond market. And getting that deal done, I think will be potentially very positive for the equity. Could you kind of elaborate on your strategy for addressing that kind of part of the funding program? It would be helpful."

We will -- we continue to see in positive momentum in our customer revenue stream, and this will step it up from a regulatory revenue perspective. I will say, too, that in the back half of this year, we'll also be recognizing the amount that we get as a true-up payment as well as certain unwind of the frozen support. So in total for the year is we will have more than the $283 million of the CAF II support because it also will include some unwind, but that will be in the back half of the year. Think about this, Dave, proportionately over, call it, a 5-month period, because we'll get the true-up payment we anticipate this month here, so we'll see probably 2/5 of that impact in the third quarter and then the remaining 3/5 in Q4."

The benefits that you see on ARPC were partially associated with that as well as customers moving to higher speeds and also customers taking our Frontier Secure product set. So it's a combination of all 3 of those. As we look at the Verizon properties that we're acquiring, we will continue to pass through the content price hikes. We also will be pricing -- passing those through on our legacy FiOS markets as well as Connecticut. You'll see us do that generally in the same time frame as most others in the first half of any calendar year. And as we look at the pricing that Verizon has in the market, again we'll be replicating that pricing in those markets towards the end of the year and rolling that out in our existing markets. But more importantly, we will not have any changes to those price points or bundles or business processes, so we eliminate the potential for a similar migration effect that occurred in Connecticut.

So we have a huge amount of experience in upgrading those markets, and that's what's informed our confidence on being able to accomplish the goals of CAF II within the incremental CapEx above the current frozen support levels. We've seen nothing that's really changed our mind on that. We were able to actually accomplish all of the CAF I build-out below what the original allocation of the CAF I funds were. So we feel very good about that, and we're also very bullish based on the experience and the take rates that we've seen in the CAF I areas for what we can expect from knock-on effect for customers taking the product after we enable those areas. So many of these customers, their only solution today is either a dial-up, which seems crazy for us to be talking about that, but also a satellite-based broadband.

I will review our Q2 performance and discuss our plans for the remainder of the year, as well as our deployment plans for CAF II.
Please turn to Slide 5. We achieved sequential growth in customer revenue in the second quarter. This reflects both stabilization in Connecticut and growth in our legacy Frontier footprint. Actions taken towards the end of the first quarter stabilized Connecticut residential customer migrations to lower-cost packages. That trend continued through the second quarter and through July. In other words, we have experienced 5 consecutive months of stability, and we are confident that the migration pressure that impacted Q1 will not reoccur in the remainder of the year. In addition, the Connecticut customers that migrated in early Q1 will see their promotional pricing expire in early 2016, offering an opportunity to return to more normal ARPC levels.
Second quarter net broadband additions were more than 29,200. This represents our 10th consecutive quarter of robust broadband growth, even though the second quarter is seasonally softer, as full years end. Once again, this quarter, our success has been broadly based. We have gained residential broadband share in over 75% of our markets year-to-date, illustrating that our go-to-market approach continues to resonate. In addition, our alternate distribution channels have produced great results in both the residential and commercial segments.
We continue to see more customers choose higher-speed broadband products. In the second quarter, 45% of the broadband activity was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits. With about 75% of our broadband customers still utilizing our basic speed tier, we have a substantial opportunity to improve our average revenue per customer as they upgrade their Internet service to higher speeds over time. This illustrates the benefits delivered by ongoing network investments. Going forward, we will continue to expand speed and capacities. We will also focus on improving our operational support systems to make it easier for customers to self-serve and manage their use of our products.
Revenues from small, medium and enterprise were a bright spot. The second quarter marked our 6th consecutive quarter of stable SME revenue in legacy markets. In Connecticut, SME revenue grew slightly from Q1 levels. We see ample opportunity to further penetrate this segment throughout the country as we continue to build our sales distribution networks.
Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with these results. We have seen success in selling Ethernet-based products to all segments of the commercial base. In addition, we have made excellent progress in closing sales with many municipalities for next-gen 911 systems. This will yield benefits in the coming quarters and cement long-term relationships that will survive for many years.
Over the last few years, we have made substantial investments to enhance our Ethernet capabilities for both the wholesale and retail markets. These investments have produced strong year-over-year double-digit growth in our Ethernet service revenue. This growth, coupled with strong performance in all our commercial sales distribution channels, more than offset the headwinds we continue to experience in wireless backhaul segment. Wireless backhaul is now down to about 4% of our total revenue, so this will have less impact on our business in the future.
In July, we accepted $283 million in annual CAF II funding. This was the full amount for which we were eligible. We have been busy planning the deployment to maximize impact in the limited construction season left in 2015. These efforts will commence in August and will continue until the close of our construction season in October. John will cover the financial aspects of CAF II shortly. In summary, we are very excited about this program and believe it offers an opportunity to change lives and build value for our shareholders.
Turning to the Verizon transaction. We made substantial progress in the second quarter. In June, we completed our equity offering, raising $2.75 billion in common and preferred equity. We appreciate the confidence our new investors have placed in us, as well as the additional commitment many of you made during this equity offering. This was a very significant element of our funding for the acquisition and was necessary to complete prior to moving forward with our debt offerings. John will cover this further in his presentation.
Our integration teams are working diligently to finalize network cutover plans and to identify customer experience gaps for remediation. We have already completed a great deal of the work. The conversion efforts are all going well, with no material obstacles identified. 
From a regulatory standpoint, we expect to receive the limited approval needed for Texas shortly. The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a case schedule that would yield a final approval by the end of December. Under this schedule, we have been meeting with various community leaders and organizations throughout California to understand their perspectives. In addition, the CPUC is holding 11 public comment sessions throughout the state. These sessions will be completed over the next several weeks. 
Importantly, we reached an agreement with the unions that represent the workers in these states. This was a win-win for all involved. The unions are now enthusiastically supporting approval at the state and federal level. 
On the federal side, we continue to work with the FCC to explain the benefits of this transaction for customers. We remain confident that we will receive FCC approval in the second half of the year, and therefore, we are now targeting a close date of March 31, 2016.
Please turn to Slide 6. The Verizon acquisition will transform Frontier. As you can see from the pie charts on this slide, with the addition of the Verizon markets, residential voice revenues will constitute less than 20% of Frontier's pro forma revenue based on 2014 run rates. Likewise, wireless backhaul revenues from the continuing Frontier territories will comprise only about 2% of overall revenues, making any future declines less consequential. We will also gain a substantially enlarged FiOS footprint and much greater scale. This transaction increases Frontier's growth profile and reduces our exposure to declining portions of our business, improving our business mix significantly. Another benefit of this transaction is the technology refresh that we will enjoy for our existing FiOS markets. We are currently finalizing our plans to introduce this new technology in these FiOS markets in Q4. 
The new FiOS platform and existing Verizon pricing and bundles will become the new standard for our current FiOS markets later this year. This will allow us to have 3 to 6 months of operation of the refreshed platform prior to integration of the new states. We will utilize this time to get our team very comfortable with the new features, functionality and business processes needed to support the current FiOS platform. And then we will continue the exact Verizon pricing and bundle construction in the new markets following conversion. As a result, we will not see the migration impact we saw in Connecticut in Q1. This conversion change will reduce training requirements of transferring employees, maintain the effectiveness of alternate channel partners, and most importantly, prevent the possibility of revenue declines associated with bundle migration, as we experienced in Connecticut. 
We continue to anticipate significant synergies as we substitute Frontier's lower cost structure for Verizon's. The Frontier team is working to deliver at or above synergies and EBITDA levels that we have communicated. The key driver of our synergies is the elimination of the Verizon expense allocations. As we approach the midpoint of our integration efforts, we remain highly confident in delivering on pro forma financial projections. We continue to estimate that the completion of the Verizon transaction will provide over 30% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will result in a solid improvement to our dividend payout ratio.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Adjusting for acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax benefit items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On July 29, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2015, payable September 30, in line with the dividend rate of the first and second quarters. We will also be paying the first dividend on our newly issued preferred shares on September 30.
Please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter revenue was $1.37 billion. Total Connecticut revenue of $264 million was stable sequentially as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Customer revenue of $1.2 billion was up $3 million sequentially or 0.3%. This represents a very strong result, particularly considering that wireless backhaul revenue declined. Excluding the decline in wireless backhaul revenue, customer revenue would have been up 0.6% sequentially. Total residential customer revenue of $615 million included a $3 million sequential increase in our legacy operations, offset by a $5 million decline in Connecticut, which we previously anticipated within our discussion of Q1 results with respect to pricing migrations. Within our legacy footprint, quarterly residential data revenue increased more than 10% over the prior year. Further, residential data revenue increased by nearly 2.6% sequentially over Q1, inclusive of Connecticut. Notwithstanding the slight quarterly sequential decline in Connecticut residential revenue, in each of the months in Q2, we achieved a higher level of revenue than March, the month in which we saw the largest revenue impact from the residential customer pricing migrations. The actions that we took in Connecticut in the latter part of Q1 had the intended positive impact. We expect this positive momentum to continue in the second half of this year.
Business customer revenue of $621 million was up $5 million sequentially. Growth in both SME and carrier wholesale more than offset the anticipated decline in wireless backhaul. The growth came in both our legacy and Connecticut operations.
Total data and Internet services revenue increased $9 million sequentially. Growth in data services outstripped the decline in non-switched revenue. Ethernet continues to grow at about a 20% annualized rate.
Voice revenue continued to decline as anticipated, reflecting the industry secular headwinds of declining voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $132 million, down $6 million sequentially. Excluding the amounts attributable to CAF I true-ups, regulatory revenue would've shown a slight increase in Q2 as compared to Q1.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $64.43 for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.5% sequentially. Business ARPC was up 1.6% sequentially. ARPC within SME was up sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 41%, which was stable with the first quarter. We continue to deliver margins above other companies in the sector with our relentless focus on expense management and continuous operational improvements. Cash operating expenses were nearly unchanged versus Q1, despite an increase in headcount to support our Frontier Secure strategic partnership service offering.
Last quarter, we said we had achieved annualized cost synergies in the Connecticut acquisition of $230 million as of the end of the first quarter, exceeding our $200 million target for synergies and far earlier than our original timing of year 3. We continue to believe there are additional synergies we will realize in both Connecticut and centralized support areas. As a result, we will be referencing them in the future as normal cost-reduction opportunities.
Capital expenditures were $178 million in the second quarter, and we spent an additional $28 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our CAF I expenditures in Q2 were $7 million. Since the inception, we have been able to operate a broadband service to 197,600 households, including an incremental 8,900 households within this past quarter. We continue to anticipate completing our CAF I obligations in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 8. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $200 million in the second quarter. Our trailing 4-quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 55.6%. Note that the next quarter, you will begin to see our dividend payout ratio trend upwards as a result of our June equity raise. This increase will be temporary until we close the Verizon acquisition. Post closing, the cash flow from those states will return the payout ratio to normal levels. As we report our results in these intervening quarters, we'll call out the impact of the dilutive effect of the incremental shares issued in anticipation of the incremental financial benefit from this transaction.
Please turn to Slide 9. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.64x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. We ended the quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and credit availability, excluding our restricted cash balance. We repaid debt of $121 million in the second quarter. We're in the process of closing a portion of the debt financing to support the Verizon transaction, which will further take out another layer of the temporary bridge facility. We have a broad window prior to the transaction closing to complete the remainder of the financing, allowing us to be opportunistic in our approach as we finish our capital raise.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged: investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio over time. We are comfortable with the leverage levels we project for after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity, along with a prudently managed balance sheet.
We announced in June that Frontier has accepted all of the CAF II support allocated to us by the FCC. These funds will begin to flow to Frontier in the third quarter with a subsequent wind down of our frozen USF support. Based upon our analysis and review, we intend to recognize this subsidy within our regulatory revenue as we receive the funds from the FCC, similar to our historical treatment of USF subsidy revenue.
Slide 10 prevents -- presents updated full year guidance for 2015. Our leveraged free cash flow is now a range of $825 million to $865 million. Capital expenditures will be within a range of $700 million to $750 million, and cash taxes are estimated at $95 million to $110 million. This leveraged free cash flow guidance reflects the CAF II subsidy revenue, including the full year 2015 true-up payment in excess of our previous frozen USF in the second half of '15, net of the incremental CapEx and cash tax impact. The updated capital expenditure guidance includes the additional spending for the CAF II program that we estimate incurring in 2015. Over the current 6-year plan life of this CAF II subsidy program, we anticipate that the CAF II subsidy revenue that we receive in excess of the historical frozen USF support levels will be sufficient to cover the incremental CapEx necessary to reach the number of customer locations we are obligated to enable. As has been the case with our prior guidance numbers, this updated guidance excludes spending related to acquisition and integration expenses.
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2015 operating results, our progress with the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and expense management, all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend. Moreover, the CAF II subsidy program creates a tremendous opportunity to enhance our network and residential capabilities in the states in which we operate and will provide an attractive financial return for our stakeholders, all while supporting the FCC's long-term objective of broadband availability.
With that, let me pass the call back to the operator and open up the line for questions."

And then I think you mentioned there weren't going to be a lot of additional expenses. So it kind of sounds like there's a step-function increase in EBITDA. That was kind of point one. And then point two, I think that you were saying that over the life of the program, over and above what you receive in USF, that incremental amount of money will cover all the CapEx spending in order to meet the requirements. I think that was clarification number two. And then just on the last piece is, on the bond deal that you're -- or debt financing that you're working on, I think one of the issues for the equity over the last little while has been that there's been this feedback loop, where the bond market's anticipating a bond raise, so the bond yields go up, and that puts pressure on the equity, and that informs an opinion for the bond market. And getting that deal done, I think will be potentially very positive for the equity. Could you kind of elaborate on your strategy for addressing that kind of part of the funding program?

The benefits that you see on ARPC were partially associated with that, as well as customers moving to higher speeds and also customers taking our Frontier Secure product set. So it's a combination of all 3 of those. As we look at the Verizon properties that we're acquiring, we will continue to pass through the content price hikes. We also will be pricing -- passing those through on our legacy FiOS markets as well as Connecticut. You'll see us do that generally in the same time frame as most others, in the first half of any calendar year. And as we look at the pricing that Verizon has in the market, again, we'll be replicating that pricing in those markets towards the end of the year and rolling that out in our existing markets. But more importantly, we will not have any changes to those price points or bundles or business processes, so we eliminate the potential for a similar migration effect that occurred in Connecticut. And I think that's a key point in our change in our integration planning."

So we anticipate the same kind of phenomenon in the CAF II as we look at it. Our engineering teams have very detailed models. They're based off of not just CAF I, but also the 14 states that we upgraded previously with Verizon. So we have a huge amount of experience in upgrading those markets, and that's what's informed our confidence on being able to accomplish the goals of CAF II within the incremental CapEx above the current frozen support levels. We've seen nothing that's really changed our mind on that. We were able to actually accomplish all of the CAF I build-out below what the original allocation of the CAF I funds were. So we feel very good about that, and we're also very bullish based on the experience and the take rates that we've seen in the CAF I areas for what we can expect from knock-on effect for customers taking the product after we enable those areas. So many of these customers, their only solution today is either a dial-up, which seems crazy for us to be talking about that, but also a satellite-based broadband. So obviously, our product, even at a fully loaded cost, would be significantly better than either of those alternatives, and we're expecting some really nice development on that."

I'm pleased to report that the quarter was marked by several significant accomplishments as we head towards the closing of our transformational Verizon transaction. We completed execution of the financing plan for the acquisition and received regulatory approval from both the SEC and the state of Texas. Meanwhile, we continue to execute strongly in our current business, delivering an 11th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions. We also began our deployment under the Connect America Fund 2 program, which will meaningfully expand our business in all of America. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Today, I'm going to review our Q3 financial performance, non-financial highlights and give you an update on the Verizon integration plans. 
Revenues increased 4.1% sequentially based on the increase in regulatory revenue under CAF II. We also extended the trend of our revenue stability in Connecticut. The actions we took towards the end of Q1 to reduce the rate of customer migrations continue to result in an improved trend. I am very confident that this issue is behind us and that Connecticut is on the right path. Revenues from small, medium and enterprise were once again very encouraging as we grew SME revenues sequentially in Q3. This adds to the track record that we discussed last quarter of 6 consecutive quarters of stable SME revenues for a total of 7 quarters of very favorable SME results and legacy. We also have continued to see solid SME results in Connecticut as well. At the same time, we experienced higher operating expenses of about $29 million over the level of Q2. These costs included a number of onetime and Trenton items, and John will discuss these shortly. Despite the temporary elevation in Q3 expenses, we remain focused on expense management, anticipate a sequential decline in expense levels in Q4 and had began to implement additional expense reduction initiatives that will improve our expense levels again in 2016. 
Most importantly, I want to assure you that I am fully confident that we will achieve and even exceed the synergy targets we have outlined for Frontier, post close of the Verizon transaction. Furthermore, we also will have identified opportunities to improve efficiencies in our existing business post closing through the application of new technologies that we are developing as part of the Verizon integration. We anticipate that this will result in an incremental improvement to our expenses.
Turning to the other highlights. The quarter represents our 11th consecutive quarter of robust net broadband additions, with 27,200 added in the period. Once again this quarter, our success had been broadly-based. We have gained residential broadband share in more than 75% of our markets year-to-date. our good market approach continues to resonate. In addition, the broadening reach of our alternate distribution channels continue to contribution meaningfully both to the residential and commercial segments. We continue to see more customers choose higher-speed broadband products. In the third quarter, 47% of the broadband activity was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits. More than 70% of our residential broadband customers are still utilizing our basic speed tier, so we have substantial opportunity to improve our average revenue per customer as they upgrade their service to higher speeds overtime. This illustrates the benefit of our ongoing network investments. We are continuing to expand speed and capacities with some areas in Connecticut now being able to offer speeds in excess of 100 megabits over our copper infrastructure. 
Over time, we will be expanding technology we use for 100 megabits in Connecticut to more of our markets elsewhere. In our files markets, we already offer speeds up to 1 gigabit, and we have seen the benefit of offering these higher speeds as customers choose speed tiers to match their lifestyle choices.
Please turn to Slide 4. Let me turn to a quick update on our Verizon transaction. As you know, the Verizon acquisition will transform Frontier significantly, maturely transitioning Frontier's revenue to more diversified mix with better growth prospects. Our integration teams continue to work diligently and we remain confident that we will be ready for closing on March 31, 2016. Financing is completely in place. Regulatory approvals are nearly complete with one pending. Union agreements have been reached and integration is on track. I'd like to provide more details on the integration process and our current status. First, we now have completed all integration project plans that detail on responsibilities and critical paths and transition in the network traffic from Verizon's network onto ours. Also covered is a system conversion as well as customer data migration. This is a highly complex process and attention to detail is critical. Our goal is flawless execution. In this regard, I am very pleased to report that we have had the successful completion of our first month data conversion. This process is off to a great start. We will have several more before we are ready to close and our internal results are ahead of our expectations. In terms of IT, we are continuing to put in place the necessary features and capabilities to handle the new market. This touches all elements of the business, handling dramatically expanded customer data, processing twice the number of monthly bills and supporting double the number of employees. In terms of operational readiness, our teams are developing and testing system enhancements and converting codes and preparing to train and on board the transferring Verizon team members at close. As I was he mentioned, we have been working with the unions representing new employees who will be joining us. We have believe that we have look at staffing needs and locations. This has been a terrific partnership, and we look forward to continue to work together with the Communication Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to ensure smooth transition.
Finally, our procurement teams are expanding our portfolio of supply agreements to support our new operating markets. We are also putting in place enhanced logistics that we have been ready to run smoothly on Day 1 and beyond. We continue to anticipate significant synergies as we eliminate allocated costs from the operations and take advantage of Frontier's lower cost structure. The frontier team is working to deliver at or above the synergies and EBITDA levels that we have communicated. As we enter the latter phases of our integration efforts, we remain highly confident in delivering on the pro forma financial outlook we have provided. We continue to estimate the completion of the Verizon transaction will provide greater than 30% accretion to leverage free cash flow per share in the first full year and will result in a solid improvement towards our dividend payout ratio. Putting together the improving trends we anticipate in legacy, the stability in Connecticut and the Verizon acquisition next spring, we believe we should experience improving revenue trend following the close of the transaction. I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."
261171,312960634,889800,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 after dividends on our newly issued preferred stock compared to loss per common share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015, and income of $0.04 per common sh",1370,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 after dividends on our newly issued preferred stock compared to loss per common share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015, and income of $0.04 per common share in the third quarter 2014. Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax benefit items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter 2015 and $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2014. 
Yesterday, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, payable December 31, in line with the dividend rate of the first 3 quarters of this year. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 31. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $1.42 billion. Connecticut revenue of $264 million was stable, with both the first and second quarters of 2015. Customer revenue of $1.22 billion was down $13 million sequentially or negative 1.1%. We are pleased that we have delivered 3 consecutive quarters of relatively stable customer revenue despite the secular voice revenue headwinds and our wireless backhaul revenue declines. Total residential customer revenue of $606 million was down $9 million as compared to Q2. The decline was concentrated in our legacy operations as Connecticut was stable sequentially. Within our legacy footprint, quarterly residential data revenue increased by more than 10.6% over the prior year. Further, residential data revenue increased by nearly 1.2% sequentially in Connecticut. For our Connecticut operations, in each of the months of Q2 and Q3, we achieved a higher level of revenue than in March, the month in which we saw the largest revenue impact from residential customer pricing migrations. The actions we took in Connecticut in the latter part of Q1 have resulted in an extended period of stability within the Connecticut results. We expect this trend to continue through the end of the year. Business customer revenue of $617 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Growth in SME was offset by the anticipated decline in wireless backhaul as well as the modest decline in carrier wholesale revenue. Total data and Internet services revenue increased $5 million sequentially. Growth in data services outstripped the decline in non-switched revenue, which includes our carrier services and wireless backhaul revenue streams as part of business customer revenue. Voice revenue declined as anticipated, reflecting the continuing headwinds of pure voice customers. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $201 million, up $69 million sequentially. Regulatory revenue included $112 million of CAF II revenue recognized during the quarter, which was partially offset by the elimination of USF present support revenue. We anticipate another increase in regulatory revenue in the fourth quarter as we recognize the balance of the CAF II payment we received from the FCC in August for the first part of 2015. Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $63.83 for the third quarter of 2015, a decline of 0.9% sequentially. Lower voice ARPC, both standalone and within product on those, was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data. Business ARPC was up 0.6% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 41.4%, which was up 40 basis points from the second quarter level as a result of the CAF II revenue recognized in the period. We did have approximately $29 million in higher adjusted operating expenses in Q3 as compared to Q2. On a sequential basis, approximately half of the increase in operating expenses was from either onetime items in the quarter, such as overtime related costs for the restoration of customer service for the natural disasters we had, substantial floods in the Midwest and wildfires in the West or from the added compensation expenses associated with 1 additional work day in the quarter as compared to Q2. We did have a slight change in sales channel mix that also led to a modest increase in customer acquisition expense. Channel mix varies from quarter-to-quarter so fluctuations in this expense are inevitable. As Dan mentioned, we have initiatives underway. For instance, in network optimization and carriage that will have a benefit to our cost structure overtime. Furthermore, once we close the Verizon transaction, we will have even greater opportunities as reflected in the synergy targets we have provided. Overall, we estimate lower adjusted operating expenses in Q4 as compared to Q3 when factoring out the Q3 onetime items. That said, as we get closer to the anticipated Verizon transaction closing date, we continue to ensure that we have the right resources for day 1. We are investing in our infrastructure as we focus on operational readiness at the closing. Capital expenditures were $177 million in the third quarter, and we spent an additional $63 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our CAF I expenditures in Q3 were $6 million, and we have now met all of our CAF I requirements. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $229 million in the third quarter. Our adjusted trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 50.8%, excluding the effects of the acquisition financing that came in the form of additional common equity convertible preferred stocks and senior notes. Note that including the equity issued in Q2 and the debt issues in Q3,  are trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio is higher at 61%. This will remain elevated until we included a compilation the 4 quarters of operating cash flow from the acquired properties after closing of the Verizon transaction.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.7x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust, excluding the funds earmarked for our Verizon transaction, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and credit availability. As you know, we closed 2 substantial debt transactions in the third quarter. The first was the $1.5 billion Term Loan A facility that we completed in August, which will be drawn at the closing of the Verizon transaction, estimated to be at the end of March 2016. The second was the $6.6 billion note offering in September. The funds from this note offering are escrowed and included in our restricted cash balances. Upon completion of our permanent capital raise, we extinguished our temporary bridge loan financing commitments. As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio. We are comfortable with the leverage levels that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Slide 8 presents full year guidance for 2015. Our leveraged free cash flow guidance remains a range of $825 million to $865 million. Capital expenditure guidance remains a range of $700 million to $750 million and cash taxes are now estimated in the range at $40 million to $50 million. With solid planning, we have been able to offset the sequential increase in operating expenses that we experienced in Q3 and anticipate for the remainder of the year as compared to the first half, with a material improvement in cash taxes. This improvement in cash taxes does not take into account any benefit that might come about if bonus depreciation expansion legislation were to be enacted. If such legislation was concluded from a timing perspective, we would carry any related cash tax benefits into 2016. In summary, Frontier's Q3 2015 operating results, our progress with the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend. I'll pass the call back to the operator and open up the lines for questions."

That includes broadband expansion in some areas which we had really forecasted cash flow our models use of CAF II funds in various parts of state of California has dictated by the CAF II rules. Speed upgrades, which we had planned to do and some of the copper markets. Enhanced reporting about supplier and diversity supplies.

In this case, we try to meet customers in a different place. Not do some traditional market techniques and rely more heavily on some of our partners from the alternate channels. And we saw very good results. This time with a slightly higher cost. But again, as John pointed out, that would change quarter-to-quarter. We would target a lower cost mix as we get into Q4, which is historically when we start to see call volumes pick up more substantially in our contact centers and we get more of a mix in that channel. As far as CAF II goes, we really got the funds in and we started. But really don't spend about $2 million in the quarter. We'll start to ramp that, but we quickly get shut down as we get into October as certain municipalities prevent us from opening roads or really starting any progress.

I'm pleased to report that the quarter was marked by several significant accomplishments as we head toward the closing of our transformational Verizon transaction. We com",1170,"Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to report that the quarter was marked by several significant accomplishments as we head toward the closing of our transformational Verizon transaction. We completed execution of the financing plan for the acquisition and received regulatory approval from both the SEC and the State of Texas. Meanwhile, we continued to execute strongly in our current business, delivering an 11th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions. We also began our deployment under the Connect America Fund II program, which will meaningfully expand our business in Mall of America. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Today, I'm going to review our Q3 financial performance, nonfinancial highlights and give you an update on the Verizon integration plans. Revenues increased 4.1% sequentially based on the increase in regulatory revenue under CAF II. We also extended the trend of revenue stability in Connecticut. The actions we took towards the end of Q1 to reduce the rate of customer migrations continue to result in an improved trend. I am very confident that this issue is behind us and that Connecticut is on the right path. 
Revenues from small, medium and enterprise were, once again, very encouraging as we grew SME revenues sequentially in Q3. This adds to the track record that we discussed last quarter of 6 consecutive quarters of stable SME revenues for a total of 7 quarters of very favorable SME results in legacy. We also have continued to see solid SME results in Connecticut as well. 
At the same time, we experienced higher operating expenses of about $29 million over the level of Q2. These costs included a number of onetime and transient items, and John will discuss these shortly. Despite the temporary elevation in Q3 expenses, we remain focused on expense management, anticipate a sequential decline in expense levels in Q4 and have begun to implement additional expense reduction initiatives that will improve our expense levels again in 2016. 
Most importantly, I want to assure you that I am fully confident that we will achieve and even exceed the synergy targets we have outlined for Frontier post-close of the Verizon transaction. Furthermore, we also will have identified opportunities to improve efficiencies in our existing business post-closing through the application of new technologies that we are developing as part of the Verizon integration. We anticipate that this will result in an incremental improvement to our expenses.
Turning to the other highlights. The quarter represents our 11th consecutive quarter of robust net broadband additions, with 27,200 added in the period. Once again, this quarter, our success has been broadly-based. We have gained residential broadband share in more than 75% of our markets year-to-date, illustrating that our good market approach continues to resonate. In addition, the broadening reach of our alternate distribution channels continue to contribute meaningfully both to the residential and commercial segments. We continue to see more customers choose higher-speed broadband products. In the third quarter, 47% of the broadband activity was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits. More than 70% of our residential broadband customers are still utilizing our basic speed tier, so we have substantial opportunity to improve our average revenue per customer as they upgrade their service to higher speeds over time. This illustrates the benefit of our ongoing network investments. We are continuing to expand speed and capacities, with some areas in Connecticut now being able to offer speeds in excess of 100 megabits over our copper infrastructure. 
Over time, we will be expanding the technology we use for 100 megabits in Connecticut to more of our markets elsewhere. In our FiOS markets, we already offer speeds up to 1 gigabit, and we have seen the benefit of offering these higher speeds as customers choose speed tiers to match their lifestyle choices.
Please turn to Slide 4. Let me turn to a quick update on our Verizon transaction. As you know, the Verizon acquisition will transform Frontier significantly, maturely transitioning Frontier's revenue to a more diversified mix with better growth prospects. Our integration teams continue to work diligently, and we remain confident that we will be ready for closing on March 31, 2016. Financing is completely in place. Regulatory approvals are nearly complete with one pending. Union agreements have been reached, and integration is on track. 
I would like to provide more details on the integration process and our current status. First, we now have completed all integration project plans that detail all responsibilities and critical paths in transitioning the network traffic from Verizon's network onto ours. Also covered is the system conversion as well as customer data migration. This is a highly complex process, and attention to detail is critical. Our goal is flawless execution. In this regard, I am very pleased to report that we've had the successful completion of our first mock data conversion. This process is off to a great start. We will have several more before we are ready to close, and our internal results are ahead of our expectations. In terms of IT, we are continuing to put in place the necessary features and capabilities to handle the new market. This touches all elements of the business, handling dramatically expanded customer data, processing twice the number of monthly bills and supporting double the number of employees. 
In terms of operational readiness, our teams are developing and testing system enhancements and conversion code and preparing to train and onboard the transferring Verizon team members at close. As I have already mentioned, we have been working with the unions representing these new employees who will be joining us. Collaboratively, we have looked at staffing needs and locations. This has been a terrific partnership, and we look forward to continue to work together with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers to ensure a smooth transition.
Finally, our procurement teams are expanding our portfolio of supplier agreements to support our new operating markets. We are also putting in place enhanced logistics that will be ready to run smoothly on Day 1 and beyond. 
We continue to anticipate significant synergies as we eliminate allocated costs from the operations and take advantage of Frontier's lower cost structure. The Frontier team is working to deliver at or above the synergies and EBITDA levels that we have communicated. As we enter the latter phases of our integration efforts, we remain highly confident in delivering on the pro forma financial outlook we have provided. We continue to estimate that the completion of the Verizon transaction will provide greater than 30% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will result in a solid improvement to our dividend payout ratio. Putting together the improving trends we anticipate in legacy, the stability in Connecticut and the Verizon acquisition next spring, we believe we should experience improving revenue trends following the close of the transaction. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 after dividends on our newly issued preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015 and income of $0.04 per common s",1376,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 after dividends on our newly issued preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015 and income of $0.04 per common share in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax benefit items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2014. 
Yesterday, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, payable December 31, in line with the dividend rate of the first 3 quarters of this year. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 31. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $1.42 billion. Connecticut revenue of $264 million was stable with both the first and second quarters of 2015. Customer revenue of $1.22 billion was down $13 million sequentially or negative 1.1%. We are pleased that we have delivered 3 consecutive quarters of relatively stable customer revenue despite the secular voice revenue headwinds and our wireless backhaul revenue declines. 
Total residential customer revenue of $606 million was down $9 million as compared to Q2. The decline was concentrated in our legacy operations, as Connecticut was stable sequentially. Within our legacy footprint, quarterly residential data revenue increased by more than 10.6% over the prior year. Further, residential data revenue increased by nearly 1.2% sequentially, inclusive of Connecticut. 
For our Connecticut operations, in each of the months of Q2 and Q3, we achieved a higher level of revenue than in March, the month in which we saw the largest revenue impact from residential customer pricing migrations. The actions we took in Connecticut in the latter part of Q1 have resulted in an extended period of stability within the Connecticut results. We expect this trend to continue through the end of the year. 
Business customer revenue of $617 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Growth in SME was offset by the anticipated decline in wireless backhaul as well as a modest decline in carrier wholesale revenue. Total data and Internet services revenue increased $5 million sequentially. Growth in data services outstripped the decline in nonswitched revenue, which includes our carrier services and wireless backhaul revenue streams as part of business customer revenue. Voice revenue declined, as anticipated, reflecting the continuing headwinds of pure voice customers. 
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $201 million, up $69 million sequentially. Regulatory revenue included $112 million of CAF II revenue recognized during the quarter, which was partially offset by the elimination of USF frozen support revenue. We anticipate another increase in regulatory revenue in the fourth quarter as we recognize the balance of the CAF II true-up payment we received from the FCC in August for the first part of 2015. 
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $63.83 for the third quarter of 2015, a decline of 0.9% sequentially. Lower voice ARPC, both standalone and within product bundles, was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data. Business ARPC was up 0.6% sequentially. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 41.4%, which was up 40 basis points from the second quarter level as a result of the CAF II revenue recognized in the period. We did have approximately $29 million in higher adjusted operating expenses in Q3 as compared to Q2. On a sequential basis, approximately half of the increase in operating expenses was from either onetime items in the quarter, such as overtime-related costs for the restoration of customer service for the natural disasters we had, substantial floods in the Midwest and wildfires in the West or from the added compensation expenses associated with one additional work day in the quarter as compared to Q2. We did have a slight change in the sales channel mix that also led to a modest increase in customer acquisition expense. Channel mix varies from quarter-to-quarter, so fluctuations in this expense are inevitable. 
As Dan mentioned, we have initiatives underway, for instance, in network optimization and carriage, that will have a benefit to our cost structure over time. Furthermore, once we close the Verizon transaction, we will have even greater opportunities, as reflected in the synergy targets we have provided. Overall, we estimate lower adjusted operating expenses in Q4 as compared to Q3 when factoring out the Q3 onetime items. That said, as we get closer to the anticipated Verizon transaction closing date, we continue to ensure that we have the right resources for Day 1. We are investing in our infrastructure as we focus on operational readiness at the closing. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million in the third quarter, and we spent an additional $63 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our CAF I expenditures in Q3 were $6 million, and we have now met all of our CAF I requirements. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $229 million in the third quarter. Our adjusted trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 50.8%, excluding the effects of the acquisition financing that came in the form of additional common equity convertible preferred stock and senior notes. Note that, including the equity issued in Q2 and the debt issues in Q3, our trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio is higher at 61%. This will remain elevated until we include in the calculation the 4 quarters of operating cash flow from the acquired properties after closing of the Verizon transaction.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.7x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. Excluding the funds earmarked for our Verizon transaction, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and credit availability. 
As you know, we closed 2 substantial debt transactions in the third quarter. The first was the $1.5 billion Term Loan A facility that we completed in August, which will be drawn at the closing of the Verizon transaction estimated to be at the end of March 2016. The second was the $6.6 billion note offering in September. The funds from this note offering are escrowed and included in our restricted cash balances. Upon completion of our permanent capital raise, we extinguished our temporary bridge loan financing commitments. 
As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio. We are comfortable with the leverage levels that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Slide 8 presents full year guidance for 2015. Our leveraged free cash flow guidance remains a range of $825 million to $865 million. Capital expenditure guidance remains a range of $700 million to $750 million, and cash taxes are now estimated in a range at $40 million to $50 million. With solid planning, we have been able to offset the sequential increase in operating expenses that we experienced in Q3 and anticipate for the remainder of the year as compared to the first half with a material improvement in cash taxes. This improvement in cash taxes does not take into account any benefit that might come about if bonus depreciation extension legislation were to be enacted. If such legislation was concluded from a timing perspective, we would carry any related cash tax benefit into 2016. 
In summary, Frontier's Q3 2015 operating results, our progress with the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.

In that way, we really align some of the requirements to meet the public needs benefit test with what our business strategy is for the state. So as I sit here today, all of those agreements, although bring substantial benefit to the systems at California, are also aligned with what we want to do from a business perspective. That includes broadband expansion in some areas, which we had really forecasted in our cash flow models; use of CAF II funds in various parts of the State of California as dictated by the CAF II rules; speed upgrades, which we had planned to do in some of the copper markets; enhanced reporting about supplier and diversity supplies. And really, we are at a point now after reaching, essentially, agreements with the vast majority, if not all of the parties, that the commission will draft their order, and then we'll see what the final requirements are by the California commission.

And on the channel mix, as you rather pointed out, it was up slightly differently. We tried some different things this summer, and I think it was reflective in the strong broadband performance we were able to post. Historically, we've had -- we tried to target a mix that was more heavily based on inbound calls through our contact centers, and that's generally our lowest-cost channel. In this case, we tried to meet customers in a different place, not use some of the traditional marketing techniques and relied more heavily on some of our partners from the alternate channels. And we saw very good results. It did come with a slightly higher cost. But again, as John pointed out, that would change quarter-to-quarter. We would target a lower-cost mix as we get into Q4, which is historically when we start to see call volumes pick up more substantially in our contact centers and we get more of a mix from that channel. As far as CAF II goes, we really got the funds in, then we started. But we really only spend about $2 million in the quarter. We'll start to ramp that, but we'll quickly get shut down as we get into October as certain municipalities prevent us from opening roads or really starting any progress. So we'll see more of a ramp-up as we get into 2016. And we'll provide more guidance on that as we get through the end of the fourth quarter."

On the SME front, we see certainly robust competition on the very small that are more attributable to cable competitors that are in the different markets. At the very high end, which we don't necessarily play as much in the enterprise space -- I mean, we do in certain markets. So that seems to be where more of the higher-end service and some of the other competitors are playing. We feel very good about the total solution that we offer. Our sweet spot is more in the high-end and small and the medium and the lower-end enterprise. Those areas will bring real value to our customers in providing turnkey solutions as well as a robust network that can interconnect their local facilities. So it might be a health care customer. It could be a trucking customer. So those are places we've played well. We're doing quite well in there providing solutions. And the other area that I would just say is we're starting to see some traction in our Ethernet on our wholesale side. So you asked about SME. But I think in the future, you'll see continued growth in that segment as well. 
So in closing, we, once again, had a very solid result this quarter, both in the legacy and Connecticut portions of the business. In the third quarter, we were successful in completing a broad range of significant milestones for the acquisition of California, Texas and Florida markets, and our integration activities remain on track. The entire company remains intensely focused on increasing shareholder value, and we believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us. So thank you for joining us on our call today, and we look forward to updating you again on the fourth quarter."

I'm pleased to report that the quarter was marked by several significant accomplishments as we head toward the closing of our transformational Verizon transaction. We com",1168,"Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to report that the quarter was marked by several significant accomplishments as we head toward the closing of our transformational Verizon transaction. We completed execution of the financing plan for the acquisition and received regulatory approval from both the SEC and the State of Texas. Meanwhile, we continued to execute strongly in our current business, delivering an 11th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions. We also began our deployment under the Connect America Fund II program, which will meaningfully expand our business in rural America. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Today, I'm going to review our Q3 financial performance, nonfinancial highlights and give you an update on the Verizon integration plans. Revenues increased 4.1% sequentially based on the increase in regulatory revenue under CAF II. We also extended the trend of revenue stability in Connecticut. The actions we took towards the end of Q1 to reduce the rate of customer migrations continued to result in an improved trend. I am very confident that this issue is behind us and that Connecticut is on the right path. 
Revenues from small, medium and enterprise were, once again, very encouraging as we grew SME revenues sequentially in Q3. This adds to the track record that we discussed last quarter of 6 consecutive quarters of stable SME revenues for a total of 7 quarters of very favorable SME results in legacies. We also have continued to see solid SME results in Connecticut as well. 
At the same time, we experienced higher operating expenses of about $29 million over the level of Q2. These costs included a number of onetime and transient items, and John will discuss these shortly. Despite the temporary elevation in Q3 expenses, we remain focused on expense management, anticipate a sequential decline in expense levels in Q4 and have begun to implement additional expense reduction initiatives that will improve our expense levels again in 2016. 
Most importantly, I want to assure you that I am fully confident that we will achieve and even exceed the synergy targets we have outlined for Frontier post-close of the Verizon transaction. Furthermore, we also will have identified opportunities to improve efficiencies in our existing business post-closing, through the application of new technologies that we are developing as part of the Verizon integration. We anticipate that this will result in an incremental improvement to our expenses.
Turning to the other highlights. The quarter represents our 11th consecutive quarter of robust net broadband additions, with 27,200 added in the period. Once again, this quarter, our success has been broadly-based. We have gained residential broadband share in more than 75% of our markets year-to-date, illustrating that our go-to-market approach continues to resonate. In addition, the broadening reach of our alternate distribution channels continue to contribute meaningfully both to the residential and commercial segments. We continue to see more customers choose higher-speed broadband products. In the third quarter, 47% of the broadband activity was above the basic speed tier of 6 megabits. More than 70% of our residential broadband customers are still utilizing our basic speed tier, so we have substantial opportunity to improve our average revenue per customer as they upgrade their service to higher speeds over time. This illustrates the benefit of our ongoing network investments. We are continuing to expand speed and capacities, with some areas in Connecticut now being able to offer speeds in excess of 100 megabits over our copper infrastructure. 
Over time, we will be expanding the technology we use for 100 megabits in Connecticut to more of our markets elsewhere. In our FiOS markets, we already offer speeds up to 1 gigabit, and we have seen the benefit of offering these higher speeds as customers choose speed tiers to match their lifestyle choices.
Please turn to Slide 4. Let me turn to a quick update on our Verizon transaction. As you know, the Verizon acquisition will transform Frontier significantly, materially transition Frontier's revenue to a more diversified mix with better growth prospects. Our integration teams continue to work diligently, and we remain confident that we will be ready for closing on March 31, 2016. Financing is completely in place. Regulatory approvals are nearly complete with one pending. Union agreements have been reached, and integration is on track. 
I would like to provide more details on the integration process and our current status. First, we now have completed all integration project plans that detail all responsibilities and critical paths in transitioning the network traffic from Verizon's network onto ours. Also covered is the system conversion as well as customer data migration. This is a highly complex process, and attention to detail is critical. Our goal is flawless execution. In this regard, I am very pleased to report that we've had the successful completion of our first mock data conversion. This process is off to a great start. We will have several more before we are ready to close, and our internal results are ahead of our expectations. In terms of IT, we are continuing to put in place the necessary features and capabilities to handle the new market. This touches all elements of the business, handling dramatically expanded customer data, processing twice the number of monthly bills and supporting double the number of employees. 
In terms of operational readiness, our teams are developing and testing system enhancements and conversion code and preparing to train and onboard the transferring Verizon team members at close. As I have already mentioned, we have been working with the unions representing these new employees who will be joining us. Collaboratively, we have looked at staffing needs and locations. This has been a terrific partnership, and we look forward to continue to work together with the Communication Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers to ensure a smooth transition.
Finally, our procurement teams are expanding our portfolio of supplier agreements to support our new operating markets. We are also putting in place enhanced logistics that we'll be ready to run smoothly on Day 1 and beyond. 
We continue to anticipate significant synergies as we eliminate allocated costs from the operations and take advantage of Frontier's lower cost structure. The Frontier team is working to deliver at or above the synergies and EBITDA levels that we have communicated. As we enter the latter phases of our integration efforts, we remain highly confident in delivering on the pro forma financial outlook we have provided. We continue to estimate that the completion of the Verizon transaction will provide greater than 30% accretion to leveraged free cash flow per share in the first full year and will result in a solid improvement to our dividend payout ratio. Putting together the improving trends we anticipate in legacy, the stability in Connecticut and the Verizon acquisition next spring, we believe we should experience improving revenue trends following the close of the transaction. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 after dividends on our newly-issued preferred stock, compared to a loss per common share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015 and income of $0.04 per common",1375,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 after dividends on our newly-issued preferred stock, compared to a loss per common share of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2015 and income of $0.04 per common share in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax benefit items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2014. 
Yesterday, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, payable December 31, in line with the dividend rate of the first 3 quarters of this year. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 31. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $1.42 billion. Connecticut revenue of $264 million was stable with both the first and second quarters of 2015. Customer revenue of $1.22 billion was down $13 million sequentially or negative 1.1%. We are pleased that we have delivered 3 consecutive quarters of relatively stable customer revenue despite the secular voice revenue headwinds and our wireless backhaul revenue declines. 
Total residential customer revenue of $606 million was down $9 million as compared to Q2. The decline was concentrated in our legacy operations, as Connecticut was stable sequentially. Within our legacy footprint, quarterly residential data revenue increased by more than 10.6% over the prior year. Further, residential data revenue increased by nearly 1.2% sequentially, inclusive of Connecticut. 
For our Connecticut operations, in each of the months of Q2 and Q3, we achieved a higher level of revenue than in March, the month in which we saw the largest revenue impact from residential customer pricing migrations. The actions we took in Connecticut in the latter part of Q1 have resulted in an extended period of stability within the Connecticut results. We expect this trend to continue through the end of the year. 
Business customer revenue of $617 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Growth in SME was offset by the anticipated decline in wireless backhaul as well as a modest decline in carrier wholesale revenue. Total data and Internet services revenue increased $5 million sequentially. Growth in data services outstripped the decline in nonswitched revenue, which includes our carrier services and wireless backhaul revenue streams as part of business customer revenue. Voice revenue declined as anticipated, reflecting the continuing headwinds of fewer voice customers. 
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $201 million, up $69 million sequentially. Regulatory revenue included $112 million of CAF II revenue recognized during the quarter, which was partially offset by the elimination of USF frozen support revenue. We anticipate another increase in regulatory revenue in the fourth quarter as we recognize the balance of the CAF II true-up payment we received from the FCC in August for the first part of 2015. 
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $63.83 for the third quarter of 2015, a decline of 0.9% sequentially. Lower voice ARPC, both standalone and within product bundles, was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data. Business ARPC was up 0.6% sequentially. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 41.4%, which was up 40 basis points from the second quarter level as a result of the CAF II revenue recognized in the period. We did have approximately $29 million in higher adjusted operating expenses in Q3 as compared to Q2. On a sequential basis, approximately half of the increase in operating expenses was from either onetime items in the quarter, such as overtime-related costs for the restoration of customer service for the natural disasters we had, substantial floods in the Midwest and wildfires in the West, or from the added compensation expense associated with one additional work day in the quarter as compared to Q2. We did have a slight change in sales channel mix and that also led to a modest increase in customer acquisition expense. Channel mix varies from quarter-to-quarter, so fluctuations in this expense are inevitable. 
As Dan mentioned, we have initiatives underway, for instance in network optimization and carriage, that will have a benefit to our cost structure over time. Furthermore, once we close the Verizon transaction, we will have even greater opportunities, as reflected in the synergy targets we have provided. Overall, we estimate lower adjusted operating expenses in Q4 as compared to Q3 when factoring out the Q3 onetime items. That said, as we get closer to the anticipated Verizon transaction closing date, we continue to ensure that we have the right resources for Day 1. We are investing in our infrastructure as we focus on operational readiness at the closing. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million in the third quarter, and we spent an additional $63 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our CAF I expenditures in Q3 were $6 million, and we have now met all of our CAF I requirements. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our leveraged free cash flow was $229 million in the third quarter. Our adjusted trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio remains very strong and sustainable at 50.8%, excluding the effects of the acquisition financing that came in the form of additional common equity convertible preferred stock and senior notes. Note that, including the equity issued in Q2 and the debt issued in Q3, our trailing fourth quarter dividend payout ratio is higher at 61%. This will remain elevated until we include in the calculation the 4 quarters of operating cash flow from the acquired properties after closing of the Verizon transaction.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3, pro forma for Connecticut, was 3.7x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. Excluding the funds earmarked for our Verizon transaction, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and credit availability. 
As you know, we closed 2 substantial debt transactions in the third quarter. The first was the $1.5 billion Term Loan A facility that we completed in August, which will be drawn at the closing of the Verizon transaction estimated to be at the end of March 2016. The second was the $6.6 billion note offering in September. The funds from this note offering are escrowed and included in our restricted cash balances. Upon completion of our permanent capital raise, we extinguished our temporary bridge loan financing commitments. 
As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio. We are comfortable with the leverage levels that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Slide 8 presents full year guidance for 2015. Our leveraged free cash flow guidance remains a range of $825 million to $865 million. Capital expenditure guidance remains a range of $700 million to $750 million, and cash taxes are now estimated in a range at $40 million to $50 million. With solid planning, we have been able to offset the sequential increase in operating expenses that we experienced in Q3 and anticipate for the remainder of the year, as compared to the first half with a material improvement in cash taxes. This improvement in cash taxes does not take into account any benefit that might come about if bonus depreciation extension legislation were to be enacted. If such legislation was concluded, from a timing perspective we would carry any related cash tax benefit into 2016. 
In summary, Frontier's Q3 2015 operating results, our progress with the Connecticut transaction, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend.

So that's equivalent to how we've been reporting it. With respect to business services or promotional activity, we don't see anything major in the quarter. We've had our Amazon Prime promotion. That's really added to -- got great traction with our residential customers. So we don't see anything unusual in the quarter. I think the dynamics that we see as we go forward -- continuing pickup on our broadband net adds, we do see some of the secular headwinds still in our voice revenue streams. And we will have a little bit of step-down with respect to our wireless backhaul revenue. But other than those items, nothing has really changed with respect to our business as we go forward. Our alternate channels continue to drive great activity in SME and more business there. So we're optimistic about the path for SME revenue stream."

The commission held a number of public comment hearings really around the entire service area. At this point, our philosophy has been to work collaboratively with the different parties in the transaction. I think we've had a lot of success on that. In that way, we really align some of the requirements to meet the public needs benefit test with what our business strategy is for the state. So as I sit here today, all of those agreements, although bring substantial benefit to the systems at California, are also aligned with what we want to do from a business perspective. That includes broadband expansion in some areas, which we had really forecasted in our cash flow models; use of CAF II funds in various parts of the State of California as dictated by the CAF II rules; speed upgrades, which we had planned to do in some of the copper markets; enhanced reporting about supplier and diversity supplies. And really, we are at a point now after reaching, essentially, agreements with the vast majority, if not all of the parties, that the commission will draft their order, and then we'll see what the final requirements are by the California commission. We still expect to have that draft order over the next several weeks, and that we're still anticipating an approval in the late December time frame."

And on the channel mix, as you rather pointed out, it was up slightly differently. We tried some different things this summer, and I think it was reflective in the strong broadband performance that we were able to post. Historically, we've had -- we tried to target a mix that was more heavily-based on inbound calls through our contact centers, and that's generally our lowest-cost channel. In this case, we tried to meet customers in a different place, not use some of the traditional marketing techniques and relied more heavily on some of our partners from the alternate channels. And we saw very good results. It did come with a slightly higher cost. But again, as John pointed out, that would change quarter-to-quarter. We would target a lower-cost mix as we get into Q4, which is historically when we start to see call volumes pick up more substantially in our contact centers and we get more of a mix from that channel. As far as CAF II goes, we really got the funds in and we started. But we really only spend about $2 million in the quarter. We'll start to ramp that, but we'll quickly get shut down as we get into October as certain municipalities prevent us from opening roads or really starting any progress. So we'll see more of a ramp-up as we get into 2016. And we'll provide more guidance on that as we get through the end of the fourth quarter."
