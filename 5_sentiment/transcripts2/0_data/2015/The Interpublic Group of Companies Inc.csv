As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A.
We're very pleased to report strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights, organic revenue growth was 4.8% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 5.5% for the full year. 
Operating margin in the quarter was 19.6% and for the full year, increased 120 basis points to 10.5%. As a result, operating profit increased 12% in Q4 and grew 20% for the full year. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.73 and was $0.57 adjusted for net tax benefits in the quarter. Full year earnings per share were $1.12 and with $0.98 as adjusted for discrete items that Frank will cover in detail.
That represents an increase of 26% from comparable 2013 earnings of $0.78 per share. It's clear from these very positive results that our people outperformed the financial targets we set for 2014. Our colleagues can take pride in this accomplishment. We thank them and all the talent dedicated and for the great work that they do everyday on behalf of our clients.
Turning to more color on the fourth quarter. Revenue growth was 4%, which consisted of a 4.8% organic increase and another 1.5% due to acquisitions, while currency was a negative 2.3%. We grew in all our major markets, with the exception of Continental Europe. The U.S., China, India and Brazil were important markets in which we saw a notable strong performance. 
U.S. organic growth was 3.4%. Excluding a decrease in pass-through revenue that is offset with lower expenses, U.S. organic growth was very strong at 5% in the quarter. Organic growth was 5.4% in the U.K. and double-digits in Asia Pac, LatAm and our Other Markets group. 
Continental Europe decreased 4.1% organically in the quarter. our growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, Public Relations and media. We had especially strong performance from the digital services we have embedded across the portfolio. This strategy of nurturing native digital expertise and capabilities within all our units is something we've been working out for some time and which differentiates us from some of our peers.
In terms of the specific agencies contributing to our Q4 performance, a wide range of the portfolio was represented. That list was led by McCann, SEB, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Huge, RJ, Weber Sundry, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were health care, food and beverage and retail.
Another highlight of the quarter was that we continue to build in -- build on our new business record for the year. We were pleased to add important assignments from Sprint, Grupo Bimbo, Sherwood Williamson and Record, among others. As a result, our net new business was positive in the quarter and for the full year.
Turning to operating expenses and margin. Underneath total revenue growth of 4% in the quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1%, excluding last year's fourth quarter charge for restructuring. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 150 basis points.
Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an increase of 120 basis points, reflecting leverage on both our base payroll and on O&G expenses. In Q4, we repurchased 7 million shares using $127 million. For the full year, we utilized $275 million for the repurchase of 15 million shares and our average share count eligible for dilution decreased 4% compared to 2013.
This initiative return of capital programs in 2011, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Over this period of time, we've reduced our outstanding shares by 25%. We are additionally pleased to announce this morning that the actions of our board, raising our quarterly dividend by 26% to $0.12 per share and authorizing an additional $300 million for share repurchase.
With $144 million remaining on our existing authorization as of year-end, this brings us to a total of $444 million authorized for share repurchase. In sum, the competitiveness of our agencies and the high quality of our offerings continue to drive strong performance. The accomplishments of our agencies and our talent are also being increasingly recognized and awarded by our industry.
As we enter 2015, you can see in our report today that the overall tone of business remains solid in most markets around the world, including the U.S., the U.K. and several of the larger high-growth markets. The dynamic mix shifts we're witnessing in the media landscape also represent an opportunity for us and our industry.
Given these factors and the strength of our offerings, we believe we'll continue to see solid organic growth. There are 2 key factors that temper our outlook compared to last year, and therefore need to be called out. First, there's a volatile currency environment and its possible negative effects on client spending plans. Second, we have to consider those markets with continued macro headwinds, notably Europe. 
In light of this environment, for 2015, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Our acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth, and the currency impact to our top line as well as to our operating expenses as current FX rates is expected to be approximately negative 4% for the year. 
In line with this growth target and in order to build on the strong progress we made during 2014 and improving profitability, our 2015 target is 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. As in the past, as the year unfolds, and we get more clarity around the macro issues that are creating uncertainty, we will review our perspective and report back to you during our regular calls.
We will, of course, continue to focus on the execution of our strategy, which is built on world-class creativity and digital expertise, strength in emerging markets and our increased focus on and success in delivering customized, integrated solutions, combined, as always, with discipline on cost.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results."

On Slide 2, you'll see our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 4.8%. U.S. organic growth was 3.4% and international growth was 6.4%, with growth in all regions, except Continental Europe. 
Q4 operating profit was $433 million compared with $385 million a year ago before last year's restructuring charge. Operating profit increased 20% for the full year. Full year operating margin was 10.5% and improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.73 and $0.50 per share, excluding certain discrete tax items. For the full year, diluted EPS was $1.12 per share and $0.98 per share, excluding both the positive $0.16 per share impact of the Q4 tax items and the negative $0.02 per share impact of our charge in the second quarter for the early redemption of our 6 1/4 notes. This is an increase of 26% from 2013 earnings per share of $0.78.
We used $275 million for share repurchase during the year. Our board this morning once again significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.12 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expense in detail on the slides that follow, as well as a couple of slides to clarify nonoperating adjustments. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.21 billion, an increase of 4%. Compared to Q4 '13, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 230 basis points, while net acquisitions added 150 basis points. Resulting organic revenue increase was 4.8%. 
With the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. 
For the full year, revenue growth of 5.8%, consisting of 5.5% organic growth and 130 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 1%. 
It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $30 million compared to 2013, which is offset by $30 million decrease in our O&G expense. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, growth in the fourth quarter was mainly at our integrated HD network segment, which had 5.7% organic growth. The decrease in pass-through revenue weighed on reported growth at CMG, which grew 3.2% organically, excluding that effect, led by Public Relations and high single-digit growth in sports marketing. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see that both segments had very good growth rates for the full year, with 5.5% organic growth at IHN and 5.8% organic growth at CMG. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 3.4%, on top of 6.9% a year ago. Organic growth was approximately 5%, excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, which again are offset by lower expenses. We had strong domestic fourth quarter performance at our 3 global integrated networks, McCann, SEB and Lowe, as well at Huge and Mediabrands. Health care continue to be a leading client growth sector, followed by food and beverage.
For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 4.7% and 5.8%, excluding the impact of pass-throughs, with increases across all major disciplines and nearly all agencies. Leading client sectors were once again health care and food and beverage, as well as all auto and transportation and financial services. 
Turning to the international markets. The U.K. grew 5.4% organically in Q4 and 10.6% for the full year. We had contributions from all of our agencies. Total revenue growth in the U.K. was 21%, which includes organic plus 5% from our acquisitions such as FCB, Inferno and Profero and another 5% attributable to the strength of the pound during the year. 
In Continental Europe, the environment continue to be challenging. Our organic decrease in the quarter was 4.1% and included decreases in Germany, France and Italy. For the full year, revenue decreased 1.3% on an organic basis, slightly lower than the assumptions we factored into our planning as we enter 2013. 
Included in our acquisitions, revenue in the region increased 1.2%, excluding currency. In Asia Pac, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 12.8% in Q4. That was driven by double-digit increase in Australia, India and Singapore, as well as strong results from China. 
Mediabrands, public relations, McCann and R/GA lead our growth and these same agencies lead our 8% organic growth in the region for the full year. For the year, we had double-digit growth in Australia, China, Singapore and Korea and more modest increase in India. 
In LatAm, we increased 11% organically in the quarter, with double-digit growth at Brazil and Argentina. We had growth across all of our agencies, including our marketing services offerings, our digital specialist, McCann, FCB and our media business. 
Full year growth was strong at 10.8%, on top of 10% a year ago. In our Other Markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, organic growth was 11.7% in the quarter, driven by organic increase in the Middle East and South Africa. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.5%, corresponding to calendar year 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1% compared to 4% revenue growth. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.4% compared to total revenue growth of 5.8%. 
Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue for the full year was 64% compared to 63.8% in prior year. It's important to point out that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which is offset dollar for dollar and lower O&G expense, results in some deleveraging in SRS and some leveraging of our O&G, while resulting in no impact of operating profit. 
For the full year, our ratio of base payroll, benefits and tax expense to revenue was 52.6% compared with 52.9% a year ago, which is improvement of 30 basis points and improved 50 basis points, excluding the change of pass-through revenue. 
Expense for temporary labor was 3.8% of revenue for the full year in 2014 compared to 3.6% a year ago. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2014 compared with the 1.1% in the prior year. 
Incentive expense was 3.5% of revenue for the full year 2014, reflecting higher performance-based accruals compared to a year ago due to this year's strong performance. 
Our other salaries and related categories 3.2% of revenue, which is the same level as the prior year. At year-end, our total headcount was approximately 47,400, an increase of 4.4%, which is made up of 2% from acquisitions and 2% -- 2.4% from organic hiring. 
The increases were in higher growth areas of the portfolio, which last year included McCann, Public Relations and Digital, as well as growth regions of the world and in support of a number of major new business wins. 
Turning to ops and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 23% of Q4 revenue compared with 25.3% in Q4 '13. For the full year, compared to our revenue growth of 5.8%, total O&G expense increased only 50 basis points. 
We have leverage across all of our O&G categories. For the full year, we have 40 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 20 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 20 basis points of professional fees. 
In addition, we had 50 basis points of leverage in our category of all other O&G expense as pass-through expenses decreased from a year ago along with the related revenues. These expenses are mainly in our events and direct marketing disciplines. 
On Slide 8, which show our operating margin on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects, with the most recent data point at 10.5%, we have come a long way. While pleased to achieve double-digit operating margin, we know that there's still much work to be done. We therefore, remain highly focused on attaining our goal of competitive 13% operating margins. 
Slide 9, for clarity in our year-end comparison, we have provided more detail on below-the-line adjustments in the quarter. This is the impact of our net tax benefits this year along with the impact of the charge we took in Q4 '13. 
This year, we had a net reversal of valuation allowances for deferred tax asset in Europe. The net amount was $68 million, which is a positive to reported earnings in the quarter and the year. There were 2 primary drivers, both of which were noncash items. We reversed a previously established valuation allowance of $125 million due to our business tax planning actions. That benefit was partially offset by the establishment of a $57 million tax valuation allowance in another European market due to our operating history. 
The EPS benefit was $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter. Excluding these discrete items in the fourth quarter, as you can see on the slide, our effective Q4 tax rate was 37.1% compared to 30.1% in Q4 '13. 
Slide 10 addresses the full year comparison. This picks update of our second quarter charge for debt redemption, as well as Q4 items. As you can see, adjusted for those items, our effective tax rate for the year was 39.4%, which is in line with our indications earlier this year. 
In 2013, the full year includes a charge for debt redemption. Our comparable 2013 adjusted tax rate was 36.2%. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison was $0.98 per share this year and $0.78 per share in 2013. And while there was clearly volatility around our effective tax rate, it's worth noting that our cash tax rate was again significantly lower. 
These adjustments also makes clear the impact of our share repurchase, with average diluted shares outstanding decreasing 4% from a year to 425 million. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 11. We ended the year with $1.67 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared with $1.64 billion a year ago. We returned more than $430 million to shareholders during the year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. 
On Slide 12, we turn to cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was $1.05 billion compared with $1.02 billion a year ago. The comparison includes the seasonally strong contribution working capital. Our business tends to generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash from working capital in the first quarter. 
For the full year, cash from operations was $670 million compared with $593 million in 2013. Investing activities in Q4 used $59 million, mainly for capital expenditures. For the full year, CapEx was 140 -- $149 million, while net cash used in acquisitions was $68 million. 
Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually. Financing activities used $169 million in Q4, mainly $127 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $39 million in common stock dividends. 
For the full year, our financing activities used $344 million, that reflects $275 million to repurchase common stock and $159 million for dividends in our common shares, as well as lower bank borrowings weeks. Additionally, we issued new debt that was partially offset by debt redemption.
In 2014, our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the full year was $25 million. 
On Slide 13, we show our debt decreasing from $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.73 billion at the end of 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, we issued $500 million of new 10-year notes at 4.2% and redeemed our 6.25% $350 million notes. 
Slide 14 shows the total of our average basic plus diluted shares over the last you years, and at far right shows the total as of year-end 2014. This has been an area of strong progress for us, with our average total shares decreasing approximately 25% between 2010 and 2014. Our starting position for 2014 is $418 million on that right. 
In summary, on Slide 15, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our team has executed very well with respect to supporting strong revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation as evident in the key actions taken by our board today. That leaves as well positioned entering 2015. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

Well, as you can see from our results, 2014 was a very successful year in which we saw a significant accomplishments in terms of performance in the marketplace and our financial results. We further strengthen our capital structure and built on a capital return programs, while continuing to enhance the competitiveness of our offerings, with particular emphasis on digital and creative talent and capabilities. 
Importantly, we also expanded operating margin by the 120 basis points. Highlights of our performance included solid progress at both McCann and FCB. Further market share growth at our best-in-class ER and sports marketing agencies within CMG and strong financial performance from our media operations. 
We also continue to see dynamic growth from our digital specialist agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across the portfolio.
We posted strong performance in emerging international markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America on top of outstanding growth in recent years. The competitiveness of our agencies was reflected in a very strong new business performance for the year. I believe it's fair to say that the quality of our offerings is at its highest levels and at least a decade.
During 2014, this was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio in the form of awards from industry press, as well as our performance in the most important creative and effectiveness competitions in every marketing discipline.
We once again excelled in Cannes, where McCann kept up going its strong momentum. FCB posted its best-ever performance and Lowe also showed well. We also performed strongly at the awards shows around the world. More recently, IPG agencies enjoyed the strongest showing of any holding company in the prestigious A list by Advertising Age. 
R/GA was the #1 ranked agency in 2014 and it became the first digital agency to ever top the A List. Deutsch and were also named among the industries top 4 agencies in terms of innovation, quality of work and success with clients and the new business. 
Huge and Moen was sighted on the list of agency standouts, just out side the top 10, as was Lowe India, among international shops. And House Diamond, CEO of McCann, was named advertising Executive of the Year. 
Across the range of our agencies, we're seeing good progress in terms of talent and the quality work product. 2014 was a strong year for McCann, which saw saw a range of client wins, including additional fourth quarter assignments from record bank, State Street Global Advisers and an integrated win on Oppenheimer Funds led by MRM. 
This came on the heels of integrated McCann wins on Choice Hotels, also with MRM and Office Depot, working closely with UM. FCB continues to improve performance, attract new talent and grow and standing with clients such as Nestlé, which awarded them with new assignments from health and wellness divisions, as well as Bacardi in China. The recent win was evidence of increased vitality in the flagship Chicago office. FCB health care continues to shine and will continue to receive our support to build on their success.
At Lowe, we're pleased with the integration of Profero and the fourth quarter rates of revenue market and the CFA Institute to build on the additions of Lenovo and Fiat early in 2014. We continue to look for ways to bolster the agencies presence in the U.S., which is fundamental to sourcing large multinationals for the global network. The agency's capability as a creative powerhouse with expertise in emerging markets remain evident in a very strong relationship to continues to enjoy with Unilever.
Progress continued at CMG, led by the outstanding team at Weber. The evolution of that agency into a digital and strategically leader across all disciplines has been remarkable. Golden is filing a suit and the performance of Octagon reflects the shift they are making to transform the passion points of sports and entertainment into powerful drivers of consumer engagement. 
The integration of January, a leading digital shop, acquired at mid-quarter into Jack Morton, is going well and we see the benefits of that agencies capable it is going forward.
Mediabrands posted strong financial results in the quarter and continue to deliver on full range leading-edge traditional and digital capabilities, such as Hunter Europe and represent answerable, as well as strong specialist assets such as the Ryan Holdings, ID Media and Adam. 
Fourth quarter wins include TruValu at UM and Initiative. At a time of such dynamic change in terms of technology and media channels, the focus on the growth of programmatic platforms is understandable. Yet, we should not lose sight of the fact that what we ultimately provide to marketers is a consulted service and insights. 
So the key will continue to be our impartiality and our ability to apply consumer data to our clients realtime business challenges so as to maximize the impact of their investments.
I covered the success we are seeing in our R/GA and MRM. Huge also had a very strong year and is established itself as one of the countries most innovative digital agencies. A full range of digital capabilities is also saw what sets apart Moen and Deutsch, particularly in our LA office with it modern ages in Hill Holliday, this gives us a strong portfolio of integrated agencies that are thriving and can win business on their own, as well as take part in our our customized multiagency client solutions. 
This focus on delivering open architecture solutions that integrate the best of our talent across the organization by means of customized client was once again a contributor to our results. We are one of the largest consolidation in the industry during 2014 when we prevailed in the highly-contested Microsoft review. We also won a consolidation with one of Latin Americas most important companies when we bested number of our key competitors in the great global been hoping to Mexico. We saw many additional multiagency opportunities come into the group, domestically and internationally. And we continue to improve our delivery of custom, integrated solutions on a number of existing multinational clients.
Overall, our performance in 2014 is the result of a series of long-term strategic decisions, which we backed with significant investments over time. Talent acquisition and development particularly in creative and strategic roles, as well as building digital expertise in all our agencies have been key drivers in the strong organic revenue performance we're seeing across the group. 
We've also continued to invest behind our strength in the U.S. and in major emerging markets where we have strong and growing presence. During 2014, we saw a further progress across a range of areas related to financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability, putting us on track to achieving our goal of 13% operating margin. Our return of capital programs continue to positively impact results and we cross the $2 billion threshold in terms of total return to shareholders since 2011.
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on our robust capital return programs. The latter is evident by our boards actions today, which further increase our dividend by 26% and provide for authorization in excess of $440 million for share repurchase.
We're well positioned as we go into 2015. The value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant in today's dynamic and complex consumer media landscape. Despite of range of geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions around the world, the general tone of the business remains solid. We are therefore targeting the 3% to 4% organic growth for the year and improvement in operating margin between 80 and 100 basis points.
Coupled with strong capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on a strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. We thank you for your time and continued support and we look forward to updating you on our progress on the next call. 
At this point, I'll open it up to questions."

Our leverage in terms of improving our margin continues to be focusing on our people, our creative products, our competitive offerings and obviously, converting that revenue into 30% target that we always said. It was nice to see in 2014. We converted it to 30% ratio. So when you look at our assumptions in terms of 3% or 4%, that's how we come to the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement for 2015. We're coming to the year 2015 with some tailwinds because we were net new business positive in 2014. And, of course, Alexia, I know you're going to ask how we're doing so far. And for 2015, we continue to be net new business positive. In terms of those tailwinds, I think you'll see the effect of those more in the first half the year and in the second half of the year, we'll see some cycling down, absent any new businesses wins in the meantime. And so I think it's more focusing on our cost. We've instituted a number of additional programs to make sure that our SRS ratios don't get out of line. I mean, clearly, that's where we see the biggest leverage. We did see an improvement in base benefits, as Frank outlined in his discussion. We did have -- we have a good performance so therefore, incentives went up a bit and that accounted for some higher number on the SRS ratio. But we continue to be very careful in terms of how we add headcount and we're gaining efficiencies, where -- for example, in McCann, we have graft and we're using production facilities with great efficiency on a worldwide basis. This meant to greater margins for us in bring those dollars. We keep them in-house as opposed to going out, and we see a lot of that happening in our other agencies as well."

As the year progresses and as our clients begin to feel more comfortable, that's when we start seeing some incremental spend, which frankly helps us in terms of higher-margin business. The tone is solid. Is it there concern? Of course, there is. We're in the global business right now and the effect of currency wish affect our potential benefits of her business. That's why we tempered some of our assumptions going into 2015. It's not the translation effect on our P&L that we tempered because we're matched from a revenue and expense point of view. It's the tone of the affect of the certainties on our clients and their spending and how that potentially converts to our business. But the tone of the business is solid. Our clients are working with us in terms of our plans for the year. They're spending money. Some of their money is coming, I know, 1 of the questions is always how much of it is in TV versus digital. We're seeing a tremendous focus on allocating media dollars and where it should go. And our offerings in media brands are toned into do exactly that. The use of cash or a, the use of our tools and planning techniques and in realtime, we continue to invest in those because clients want to know whether it should be digital, whether it should be TV, how it should be allocated and can they change it quickly. So we're working very closer with our clients and, of course, programmatic and automation are part of that. So I think the question is whether it's digital versus TV, I think, we have seen certainly an impact on TV. If you just on the results of the media owners in 2014, and the challenges they faced in 2015. And our job continues to be help drop our clients to navigate through that. So we have the tools, we have the talent, our requests are talking to us. They're not going back per se. The issue is how much more they're going to spend and the pressure is on us to be efficient and for us to be responsive in terms of moving the needle. And that's what we're going to do. So we feel that good about our forecast then I think that is a realistic assumption for us to use going into 2015."

So there's timing issues in there. But the fundamental basic benefits, if you will, in tax, we saw our 50 basis point improvement in 2014 and for '15, we're going to continue to be very carefully with that and yes, the answer is ultimately we have to get those SRS numbers down and that's where our focus is going to be, John."

So if there is recovery in Europe, I think we will participate. Some of our pullback in Europe, again, was client specific. 11% of our business is in Continental Europe. That's good and bad depending on how you look at it. And so as a result, if 1 or 2 clients pull back, it has a bigger impact on the results. And we saw that in 2014, which is frankly one of the reasons we missed a little bit in terms of our planning process. But we're well positioned. We continue to invest in Continental Europe in terms of talent, and that's where we have to do and we're looking for good organic growth when the recovery becomes back.

Look, we continue to believe that our model of agnostic advice in terms of where clients should be putting their money is the proper model, okay? I think there's no question that some of our competitors, as you allude to, take inventory position on the digital assets and they're using right-hand and left-hand. And I think as this rolls out, clients are going to see the profits that are being made from inventory own then we feel that, that's inconsistent with our model of being independent in terms of how we allocate media dollars on behalf of our clients. Now have we seen -- tell us that they prefer our model? Obviously, yes. If you look at our performance, we had great performance in Mediabrands and that whole model is isn't loss in our clients. I mean, at the reason there are quite some other things is exactly that, that they view us as being their partner in terms of advising where they put their money. I've said this before, and I continue to say it, if as this rolls out, if in the marketplace, it is not viewed as we view it, then obviously we're going to relook at how we do this. We do, do it on the right of Oregon and the part of business where it's disclose up front and we're seeing very nice margins on it. But right now, our model is consistent and yes, I think larger multinational clients wanted the regions they bring some of these programmatic in-house is because they don't trust our business, not ours per se, I'm speaking generically, in terms of the transparency that goes into these pricing in this black box that they're dealing with. And I think the fact that there is inventory owned being sold doesn't help. I know they can disclose it and I know that the argue that the are buying more efficiently and so on. But in terms of pricing, we don't see that. We're being -- we don't do it and we're very competitive on the pricing side of the business. So we believe our role is to be agnostic. And that we do think our clients choose us and that's why we stick to this model. And frankly, when I was a client, I would look at a it the same way. I find it difficult to think that the wall that they claim they put top and a large margin that some of them claim are getting on that isn't the cost of that advice that I'm getting on the buying side. So that's my personal view on it. But that's -- we continue to look at it. It's a reasonable question. By the way, you are is a big rent yours in the ramp up in terms of the organic growth and potentially some margin on these. As you cycle through that, that, that advantage isn't going to be there on reported numbers, right? And I do think the margin on that business is going to shrink because clients just want a greater transparency on it and that's where the margin impact will come down."

So the finance committee is that vehicle committee and frankly, on a number of the participate sit on have separate finance committees.

As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A.
We're very pleased to report strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights, organic revenue growth was 4.8% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 5.5% for the full year. Operating margin in the quarter was 19.6% and for the full year, increased 120 basis points to 10.5%. As a result, operating profit increased 12% in Q4 and grew 20% for the full year.
Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.73 and was $0.57 adjusted for net tax benefit in the quarter. Full year earnings per share were $1.12 and with $0.98 as adjusted for discrete items that Frank will cover in detail. That represents an increase of 26% from comparable 2013 earnings of $0.78 per share.
It's clear from these very positive results that our people outperformed the financial targets we set for 2014. Our colleagues can take pride in this accomplishment. We thank them and all the talent dedicated and for the great work that they do everyday on behalf of our clients.
Turning to more color on the fourth quarter. Revenue growth was 4%, which consisted of a 4.8% organic increase and another 1.5% due to acquisitions, while currency was a negative 2.3%. We grew in all our major markets, with the exception of Continental Europe. The U.S., China, India and Brazil were important markets in which we saw a notable strong performance.
U.S. organic growth was 3.4%. Excluding a decrease in pass-through revenues that is offset with lower expenses, U.S. organic growth was very strong at 5% in the quarter. Organic growth was 5.4% in the U.K. and double digits in Asia Pac, Lat Am and our Other Markets group. Continental Europe decreased 4.1% organically in the quarter.
Our growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, public relations and media. We had especially strong performance from the digital services we have embedded across the portfolio. This strategy of nurturing native digital expertise and capabilities within all our units is something we've been working at for some time and which differentiates us from some of our peers.
In terms of the specific agencies contributing to our Q4 performance, a wide range of the portfolio was represented. That list was led by McCann, FCB, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Huge, R/GA, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were health care, food and beverage and retail.
Another highlight of the quarter was that we continued to build in our new -- build on our new business record for the year. We were pleased to add important assignments from Sprint, Grupo Bimbo, Sherwin-Williams and Reckitt Benckiser, among others. As a result, our net new business was positive in the quarter and for the full year.
Turning to operating expenses and margin. Underneath total revenue growth of 4% in the quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1%, excluding last year's fourth quarter charge for restructuring. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 150 basis points.
Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an increase of 120 basis points, reflecting the leverage on both our base payroll and on O&G expenses. In Q4, we repurchased 7 million shares using $127 million. For the full year, we utilized $275 million for the repurchase of 15 million shares, and our average share count eligible for dilution decreased 4% compared to 2013.
Since initiating our return of capital programs in 2011, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Over this period of time, we've reduced our outstanding shares by 25%. We are additionally pleased to announce this morning that the actions of our board, raising our quarterly dividend by 26% to $0.12 per share and authorizing an additional $300 million for share repurchase.
With $144 million remaining on our existing authorization as of year-end, this brings us to a total of $444 million authorized for share repurchase. In sum, the competitiveness of our agencies and the high quality of our offerings continue to drive strong performance. The accomplishments of our agencies and our talent are also being increasingly recognized and awarded by our industry.
As we entered 2015, you can see in our report today that the overall tone of business remains solid in most markets around the world, including the U.S., the U.K. and several of the larger high-growth markets. The dynamic mix shifts we are witnessing in the media landscape also represent an opportunity for us and our industry.
Given these factors and the strength of our offerings, we believe we'll continue to see solid organic growth. There are key -- 2 key factors that temper our outlook compared to last year and therefore need to be called out. First, there's a volatile currency environment and its possible negative effect on client spending plans. Second, we have to consider those markets with continued macro headwinds, notably Europe.
In light of this environment, for 2015, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Our acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth, and the currency impact to our top line as well as to our operating expenses at current FX rates is expected to be approximately negative 4% for the year.
In line with this growth target and in order to build on the strong progress we made during 2014 and improving profitability, our 2015 target is 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. As in the past, as the year unfolds and we get more clarity around the macro issues that are creating uncertainty, we will review our perspective and report back to you during our regular calls.
We will, of course, continue to focus on the execution of our strategy, which is built on world-class creativity and digital expertise, strength in emerging markets and our increased focus on and success in delivering customized integrated solutions, combined as always with discipline on cost.
At this stage, I'll turn the things over to Frank for additional detail on our results."

Fourth quarter organic growth was 4.8%. U.S. organic growth was 3.4%. International growth was 6.4%, with growth in all regions, except Continental Europe.
Q4 operating profit was $433 million compared with $385 million a year ago before last year's restructuring charge. Operating profit increased 20% for the full year. Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago.
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.73 and $0.50 per share, excluding certain discrete tax items. For the full year, diluted EPS was $1.12 per share and $0.98 per share, excluding both the positive $0.16 per share impact of the Q4 tax items and the negative $0.02 per share impact of our charge in the second quarter for the early redemption of our 6.25% notes. This is an increase of 26% from 2013 earnings per share of $0.78.
We used $275 million for share repurchase during the year. Our board, this morning, once again, significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.12 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expense in detail on the slides that follow, as well as a couple of slides to clarify nonoperating adjustments.
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.21 billion, an increase of 4%. Compared to Q4 '13, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 230 basis points, while net acquisitions added 150 basis points. Resulting organic revenue increase was 4.8%.
With the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. For the full year, revenue growth of 5.8% consisted of 5.5% organic growth and 130 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 1%. It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $30 million compared to 2013, which is offset by $30 million decrease in our O&G expense.
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, growth in the fourth quarter was mainly at our Integrated Agency Network segment, which had 5.7% organic growth. The decrease in pass-through revenue weighed on reported growth at CMG, which grew 3.2% organically, excluding that effect, led by public relations and high single-digit growth in sports marketing. On the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see that both segments had very good growth rates for the full year, with 5.5% organic growth at IAN and 5.8% organic growth at CMG.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 3.4%, on top of 6.9% a year ago. Organic growth was approximately 5%, excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, which again are offset with lower expenses. We had strong domestic fourth quarter performance at our 3 global integrated networks, McCann, FCB and Lowe, as well as at Huge and Mediabrands. Health care continue to be a leading client growth sector, followed by food and beverage.
For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 4.7% and 5.8%, excluding the impact of pass-throughs, with increases across all major disciplines and nearly all agencies. Leading client sectors were once again health care and food and beverage, as well as all auto and transportation and financial services.
Turning to the international markets. The U.K. grew 5.4% organically in Q4 and 10.6% for the full year. We had contributions from all of our agencies. Total revenue growth in the U.K. was 21%, which includes organic plus 5% from our acquisitions such as FCB, Inferno and Profero and another 5% attributable to the strength of the pound during the year.
In Continental Europe, the environment continue to be challenging. Our organic decrease in the quarter was 4.1% and included decreases in Germany, France and Italy. For the full year, revenue decreased 1.3% on an organic basis, slightly lower than the assumptions we factored into our planning as we enter 2013.
Including our acquisitions, revenue in the region increased 1.2%, excluding currency. In Asia Pac, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 12.8% in Q4. That was driven by double-digit increases in Australia, India and Singapore, as well as strong results from China. Mediabrands, public relations, McCann and R/GA led our growth, and these same agencies led our 8% organic growth in the region for the full year. For the year, we had double-digit growth in Australia, China, Singapore and Korea and more modest increase in India.
In Lat Am, we increased 11% organically in the quarter, with double-digit growth at Brazil and Argentina. We had growth across all of our agencies, including our marketing services offerings, our digital specialist, McCann, FCB and our media business. Full year growth was strong at 10.8%, on top of 10% a year ago.
In our Other Markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, organic growth was 11.7% in the quarter, driven by organic increases in the Middle East and South Africa.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.5%, corresponding to calendar year 2014.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1% compared to 4% revenue growth. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.4% compared to total revenue growth of 5.8%.
Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue for the full year was 64% compared to 63.8% in the prior year. It's important to point out that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which has offset dollar for dollar and lower O&G expense, results in some deleveraging in SRS and some leveraging of our O&G, while resulting in no impact at operating profit.
For the full year, our ratio of base payroll, benefits and tax expense to revenue was 52.6% compared with 52.9% a year ago, which is an improvement of 30 basis points, and improved 50 basis points, excluding the change in pass-through revenue.
Expense for temporary labor was 3.8% of revenue for the full year in 2014 compared to 3.6% a year ago. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2014 compared with the 1.1% in the prior year. Incentive expense was 3.5% of revenue for the full year 2014, reflecting higher performance-based accruals compared to a year ago due to this year's strong performance. Our other salaries and related category is 3.2% of revenue, which is the same level as our prior year.
At year-end, our total headcount was approximately 47,400, an increase of 4.4%, which is made up of 2% from acquisitions and 2% -- 2.4% from organic hiring. The increases were in higher growth areas of the portfolio, which last year included McCann, public relations and digital, as well as growth regions of the world and in support of a number of major new business wins.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 23% of Q4 revenue compared with 25.3% in Q4 '13. For the full year, compared to our revenue growth of 5.8%, total O&G expense increased only 50 basis points.
We had leverage across all of our O&G categories. For the full year, we had 40 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 20 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 20 basis points of professional fees. In addition, we had 50 basis points of leverage in our category of all other O&G expense as pass-through expenses decreased from a year ago, along with the related revenues. These expenses are mainly in our events and direct marketing disciplines.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects, with the most recent data point at 10.5%, we have come a long way. While pleased to achieve double-digit operating margin, we are -- we know that there is still much work to be done. We therefore remain highly focused on attaining our goal of competitive 13% operating margins.
Slide 9. For clarity on our year-end comparison, we have provided more detail on below-the-line adjustments in the quarter. This is the impact of our net tax benefits this year, along with the impact of the charge we took in Q4 '13.
This year, we had a net reversal of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in Europe. The net amount was $68 million, which is a positive to reported earnings in the quarter and the year. There were 2 primary drivers, both of which were noncash items. We reversed a previously established valuation allowance of $125 million due to our business tax planning actions. That benefit was partially offset by the establishment of a $57 million tax valuation allowance in other European markets due to our operating history.
The EPS benefit was $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter. Excluding these discrete items in the fourth quarter, as you can see on the slide, our effective Q4 tax rate was 37.1% compared to 30.1% in Q4 '13.
Slide 10 addresses the full year comparison. This picks up the impact of our second quarter charge for debt redemption, as well as Q4 items. As you can see, adjusted for those items, our effective tax rate for the year was 39.4%, which is in line with our indications earlier this year.
In 2013, the full year includes a charge for debt redemption. Our comparable 2013 adjusted tax rate was 36.2%. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison was $0.98 per share this year and $0.78 per share in 2013. And while there was clearly volatility around our effective tax rate, it's worth noting that our cash tax rate was again significantly lower. These adjustments also makes clear the impact of our share repurchase, with average diluted shares outstanding decreasing 4% from a year ago to 425 million.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 11. We ended the year with $1.67 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared with $1.64 billion a year ago. We returned more than $430 million to shareholders during the year through share repurchases and common stock dividends.
On Slide 12, we turn to cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was $1.05 billion compared with $1.02 billion a year ago. The comparison includes a seasonally strong contribution working capital. Our business tends to generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash from working capital in the first quarter.
For the full year, cash from operations was $670 million compared with $593 million in 2013. Investing activities in Q4 used $59 million, mainly for capital expenditures. For the full year, CapEx was $149 million, while net cash used in acquisitions was $68 million.
Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually. Financing activities used $169 million in Q4, mainly $127 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $39 million in common stock dividends.
For the full year, our financing activities used $344 million. That reflects $275 million to repurchase common stock and $159 million for dividends in our common shares, as well as lower bank borrowings. Additionally, we issued new debt that was partially offset by debt redemption. In 2014, our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the full year was $25 million.
On Slide 13, we show our debt decreasing from $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.73 billion at the end of 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, we issued $500 million of new 10-year notes at 4.2% and redeemed our 6.25% $350 million notes.
Slide 14 shows the total of our average basic plus diluted shares over the last few years. And at far right, it shows the total as of year-end 2014. This has been an area of strong progress for us, with our average total shares decreasing approximately 25% between 2010 and 2014. Our starting position for 2014 is $418 million on the right.
In summary, on Slide 15, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our team has executed very well with respect to supporting strong revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation, as evident in the key actions taken by our board today. That leaves as well positioned entering 2015.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

Well, as you can see from our results, 2014 was a very successful year in which we saw significant accomplishments in terms of performance in the marketplace and our financial results. We further strengthened our capital structure and built on our capital return programs while continuing to enhance the competitiveness of our offerings, with particular emphasis on digital and creative talent and capabilities. Importantly, we also expanded operating margin by 120 basis points.
Highlights of our performance included solid progress at both McCann and FCB, further market share growth at our best-in-class PR and sports marketing agencies within CMG and strong financial performance from our media operations. We also continue to see dynamic growth from our digital specialist agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across the portfolio.
We posted strong performance in emerging international markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, on top of outstanding growth in recent years. The competitiveness of our agencies was reflected in a very strong new business performance for the year. I believe it's fair to say that the quality of our offerings is at its highest level in at least a decade.
During 2014, this was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio in the form of awards from industry press, as well as our performance in the most important creative and effectiveness competitions in every marketing discipline.
We once again excelled in Cannes, where McCann kept up its strong momentum. FCB posted its best-ever performance and Lowe also showed well. We also performed strongly at the Effie Awards shows around the world. More recently, IPG agencies enjoyed the strongest showing of any holding company in the prestigious A-List by Advertising Age.
R/GA was the #1 ranked agency in 2014, and it became the first digital agency to ever top the A-List. Deutsch and Weber Shandwick were also named among the industry's top 4 agencies in terms of innovation, quality of work and success with clients and in new business.
Huge and Mullen were cited on the list of agency standouts, just outside the top 10, as was Lowe India, among international shops. And Harris Diamond, the CEO of McCann, was named Advertising Executive of the Year.
Across the range of our agencies, we're seeing good progress in terms of talent and the quality of work product. 2014 was a strong year for McCann, which saw a range of client wins, including additional fourth quarter assignments from Reckitt Benckiser, State Street Global Advisers and an integrated win on Oppenheimer Funds led by MRM. This came on the heels of integrated McCann wins on Choice Hotels, also with MRM, and Office Depot, working closely with UM.
FCB continues to improve performance, attract new talent and grow and standing with clients such as Nestlé, which awarded them new assignments from their Waters and Health & Wellness divisions, as well as Bacardi in China. The recent Michelob ULTRA win was evidence of increased vitality in the flagship Chicago office. FCB health care continues to shine and will continue to receive our support to build on their success.
At Lowe, we're pleased with the integration of Profero and with fourth quarter wins of Remy Martin and the CFA Institute to build on the additions of Lenovo and Fiat early in 2014. We continue to look for ways to bolster the agency's presence in the U.S., which is fundamental to sourcing large multinationals for the global network. The agency's capability as a creative powerhouse, with expertise in emerging markets, remain evident in a very strong relationship it continues to enjoy with Unilever.
Progress continued at CMG, led by the outstanding team at Weber Shandwick. The evolution of that agency into a digital and strategic leader across all disciplines has been remarkable. Golin is filing suit, and the performance of Octagon reflects the shifts they are making to transform their passion points of sports and entertainment into powerful drivers of consumer engagement. The integration of Genuine, a leading digital shop acquired at mid-year, into Jack Morton, is going well, and we should see the benefits of that agency's capabilities going forward.
Mediabrands posted strong financial results in the quarter and continued to deliver on full range leading-edge traditional and digital capabilities, such as Cadreon and Reprise and Ansible, as well as strong specialist assets such as Orion Holdings, ID Media and our out-of-home offering, Rapport.
Fourth quarter wins included True Value at UM and Bose at Initiative. At a time of such dynamic change in terms of technology and media channels, the focus on the growth of programmatic platforms is understandable, yet we should not lose sight of the fact that what we ultimately provide to marketers is a consulted service and insights. So the key will continue to be our impartiality and our ability to apply consumer data to our clients' real-time business challenges so as to maximize the impact of their investments.
I'm coming off this [ph] success we are seeing at R/GA and MRM. Huge also had a very strong year and has established itself as one of the country's most innovative digital agencies. A full range of digital capabilities is also what sets apart Mullen and Deutsch, particularly in their L.A. office. With the Martin Agency in Hill Holliday, this gives us a strong portfolio of integrated agencies that are thriving and can win business on their own, as well as take part in our customized multi-agency client solutions.
This focus on delivering open architecture solutions that integrate the best of our talent across the organization by means of customized client teams was once again a contributor to our results. We won the largest consolidation in the industry during 2014 when we prevailed in a hotly contested Microsoft review.
We also won a consolidation with one of Latin America's most important companies when we bested a number of our key competitors in the Grupo Bimbo pitch in Mexico. We saw many additional multi-agency opportunities come into the group, domestically and internationally. And we continue to improve our delivery of custom integrated solutions on a number of existing multinational clients.
Overall, our performance in 2014 is the result of a series of long-term strategic decisions, which we backed with significant investments over time. Talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, as well as building digital expertise in all our agencies, have been key drivers in the strong organic revenue performance we're seeing across the group.
We've also continued to invest behind our strength in the U.S. and in major emerging markets where we have strong and growing presence. During 2014, we saw a further progress across a range of areas related to financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability put us on track to achieving our goal of 13% operating margin. Our return of capital programs continued to positively impact results, and we crossed the $2 billion threshold in terms of total return to shareholders since 2011.
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on our robust capital return programs. The latter is evident by our board's actions today, which further increase our dividend by 26% and provided for our current authorization in excess of $440 million for share repurchase.
We're well positioned as we go into 2015. The value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant in today's dynamic and complex consumer media landscape. Despite a range of geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions around the world, the general tone of the business remains solid. We are therefore targeting the 3% to 4% organic growth for the year and improvement in operating margin between 80 and 100 basis points.
Coupled with strong capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on a strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. We thank you for your time and continued support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on the next call.
At this point, I'll open it up to questions."

The fact that we were down in 2014 was a little bit below our plan. With the uncertainty out there, it's not wise for us to count on a big recovery there. So what -- we are refreshing our talent, we've made some changes in personnel in Continental Europe. We did some acquisitions certainly with Inferno and Profero and a couple of smaller acquisitions, and we continue to look to bolster our competitiveness there. But we're basically keeping an eye in there without making any big bets in terms of strong recovery in terms of our forecast for the rest of the year. Our leverage in terms of improving our margin continues to be focusing on our people, our creative products, our competitive offerings and obviously, converting that revenue into 30% target that we always said. It was nice to see, in 2014, we converted it to 30% ratio. So when you look at our assumptions in terms of 3% to 4%, that's how we come to the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement for 2015. We're coming to the year of 2015 with some tailwinds because we were net new business positive in 2014. And of course, Alexia, I know you're going to ask how are we doing so far. And for 2015, we continue to be net new business positive. In terms of those tailwinds, I think you'll see the effect of those more in the first half the year. And in the second half of the year, we'll see some cycling down, absent any new businesses wins in the meantime. And so I think it's more focusing on our cost. We've instituted a number of additional programs to make sure that our SRS ratios don't get out of line. I mean, clearly, that's where we see the biggest leverage. We did see an improvement in base benefits, as Frank outlined in his discussion. We did have -- we had a good performance. So therefore, incentives went up a bit, and that accounted for some -- the higher number on the SRS ratio. But we continue to be very careful in terms of how we add headcount, and we're gaining efficiencies. We're -- for example, in McCann, we have Craft and we're using production facilities with great efficiency on a worldwide basis. These led to greater margins for us in bringing those dollars. We keep them in-house as opposed to going out, and we see a lot of that happening in our other agencies as well."

So we look at existing AOR contracts. As the year progresses and as our clients begin to feel more comfortable, that's when we start seeing some incremental spend, which frankly helps us in terms of higher-margin business. The tone is solid. Is there concern? Of course, there is. We're in a global business right now, and there are effects of currency which affects or potentially affects our business. That's why we tempered some of our assumptions going into 2015. It's not the translation effect on our P&L that we tempered because we're matched from a revenue and expense point of view. It's the tone of the effect of these currencies on our clients and their spending and how that potentially converts to our business. But the tone of the business is solid. Our clients are working with us in terms of our plans for the year. They're spending money. Some of the money is coming. I know, one of the questions is always how much of it is in TV versus digital. We're seeing a tremendous focus on allocating media dollars and where it should go. And our offerings in media brands are attuned into doing exactly that. The use of Cadreon, the use of our tools and planning techniques and real time, we continue to invest in those because clients want to know whether it should be digital, whether it should be TV, how it should be allocated and can they change it quickly. So we're working very closer with our clients and of course, programmatic and automation are part of that. So I think the question is whether it's digital versus TV, I think, we've seen certainly an impact on TV. If you just look at the results of the media owners in 2014 and the challenges they face in 2015, and our job continues to be help drop our clients navigate through that. So we have the tools, we have the talent, our clients are talking to us. They're not pulling back per se. The issue is how much more they're going to spend, and the pressure is on us to be efficient and for us to be responsive in terms of moving the needle, and that's what we're going to do. So we feel good about our forecast, and I think it's a realistic assumption for us to use going into 2015."

If we're investing with new business, it's not atypical for us when we win a new business to have to ramp up and add 50 to 100 people in terms of staffing, and that staffing usually comes ahead of revenue. So there's timing issues in there. But the fundamental basic benefits, if you will, in tax, we saw our 50 basis point improvement in 2014 and for '15, we're going to continue to be very careful with that.

But we have 3 global networks that are very competitive, and on top of that, our marketing disciplines and media businesses and so on, and we're very well positioned. So if there is a recovery in Europe, I think we will participate. Some of our pullback in Europe, again, was client-specific. 11% of our business is in Continental Europe. That's good and bad depending on how you look at it. And so as a result, if 1 or 2 clients pulled back, it has a bigger impact on our results. And we saw that in 2014, which is frankly one of the reasons we missed a little bit in terms of our planning process. But we're well positioned. We continue to invest in Continental Europe in terms of talent, and that's where we have to. And we're looking for good organic growth as the recovery becomes back.

Look -- and as we have, look, we continue to believe that our model of agnostic advice in terms of where clients should be putting their money is the proper model, okay? I think there's no question that some of our competitors, as you allude to, would take inventory position on the digital assets, and they're using right hand and left hand. And I think as this rolls out, clients are going to see the profits that are being made from inventory owned. Then we feel that, that's inconsistent with our model of being independent in terms of how we allocate media dollars on behalf of our clients. Now have we seen -- do clients tell us that they prefer our model? Obviously, yes. If you look at our performance, we had great performance at Mediabrands and that whole model isn't loss on our clients. I mean, the reason there are clients, among other things, is exactly that, that they view us as being their partner in terms of advising where they put their money. I've said this before and I continue to say it. If, as this rolls out -- if, in the marketplace, it is not viewed as we view it, then obviously we're going to relook at how we do this. We do, do it on the part [ph] of Orion and the part [ph] of business where it's disclose upfront, and we're seeing very nice margins on it. But right now, our model is consistent. And yes, I think larger multinational clients won in the regions, they bring some of this programmatic in-house is because they don't trust our business, not ours per se, I'm speaking generically, in terms of the transparency that goes into this pricing in this black box that they're dealing with. And I think the fact that there's inventory owned being sold doesn't help. I know they can disclose it, and I know they argue that they're buying more efficiently and so on. But in terms of pricing, we don't see that. We're being -- we don't do it, and we're very competitive on the pricing side of the business. So we believe our role is to be agnostic, and that we do think our clients choose us and that's why we stick to this model. And frankly, when I was a client, I would look at it the same way. I find it difficult to think that the wall that they claim they put up and the large margins that some of them claim they're getting on that isn't at the cost of that advice that they're -- I'm getting on the buying side. So that's my personal view on it. But that's -- we continue to look at it. It's a reasonable question. By the way, you're seeing a big ramp -- might as well do this. You're seeing a big ramp up in terms of the organic growth and spend potentially some margin on this. As you cycle through that, that advantage isn't going to be there on reported numbers, right? And I do think the margin on that business is going to shrink because clients there are just going to want greater transparency on it, and that's where the margin impact will be -- will come down, so..."

Yes, as we pick up clients and as we add more services, typically, the additional services carry with it a greater margin, and that's the nature of our business. Which is why, as you know, Brian, when we pick up new clients, margins on new clients in the early years aren't quite where they are as they mature as we go forward, and that's the business model. We bring in other services and we add value. But none of the services that we bring to the table are clients willing to pay extraordinary margins on. So the burden is on us to show the value add. So when we bring in the extra services, it's all with a view towards moving the needle and how we enhance their margin and frankly, at the same time, it helps us. I think that pressure is there. It will continue to be there. It will be on the media side just evidenced by, as you note in your write-ups, the big client reviews typically are occurring on the media side of the business because they continue to believe there's pricing advantages by putting that stuff up for bids and review. And it's incumbent upon us to be able to buy appropriately, give advice, couple it with proper planning and be efficient in how we operate our own businesses. And so that's never going away."

We always look at strategic plans, capital allocation and costs and how we target and so on. So the finance committee is a typical committee, frankly. The number of the boards that I sit on have separate finance committees. So since our focus is on making sure we achieve our margins, the emphasis on focusing on that for the finance committee is going to be welcomed.

As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A.
We're very pleased to report strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights, organic revenue growth was 4.8% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 5.5% for the full year. Operating margin in the quarter was 19.6% and for the full year, increased 120 basis points to 10.5%. As a result, operating profit increased 12% in Q4 and grew 20% for the full year.
Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.73 and was $0.57 adjusted for net tax benefit in the quarter. Full year earnings per share were $1.12 and with $0.98 as adjusted for discrete items that Frank will cover in detail. That represents an increase of 26% from comparable 2013 earnings of $0.78 per share.
It's clear from these very positive results that our people outperformed the financial targets we set for 2014. Our colleagues can take pride in this accomplishment. We thank them and all the talent dedicated and for the great work that they do everyday on behalf of our clients.
Turning to more color on the fourth quarter. Revenue growth was 4%, which consisted of a 4.8% organic increase and another 1.5% due to acquisitions, while currency was a negative 2.3%. We grew in all our major markets, with the exception of Continental Europe. The U.S., China, India and Brazil were important markets in which we saw a notable strong performance.
U.S. organic growth was 3.4%. Excluding a decrease in pass-through revenues that is offset with lower expenses, U.S. organic growth was very strong at 5% in the quarter. Organic growth was 5.4% in the U.K. and double digits in Asia Pac, Lat Am and our Other Markets group. Continental Europe decreased 4.1% organically in the quarter.
Our growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, public relations and media. We had especially strong performance from the digital services we have embedded across the portfolio. This strategy of nurturing native digital expertise and capabilities within all our units is something we've been working at for some time and which differentiates us from some of our peers.
In terms of the specific agencies contributing to our Q4 performance, a wide range of the portfolio was represented. That list was led by McCann, FCB, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Huge, R/GA, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were health care, food and beverage and retail.
Another highlight of the quarter was that we continued to build in our new -- build on our new business record for the year. We were pleased to add important assignments from Sprint, Grupo Bimbo, Sherwin-Williams and Reckitt Benckiser, among others. As a result, our net new business was positive in the quarter and for the full year.
Turning to operating expenses and margin. Underneath total revenue growth of 4% in the quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1%, excluding last year's fourth quarter charge for restructuring. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 150 basis points.
Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an increase of 120 basis points, reflecting the leverage on both our base payroll and on O&G expenses. In Q4, we repurchased 7 million shares using $127 million. For the full year, we utilized $275 million for the repurchase of 15 million shares, and our average share count eligible for dilution decreased 4% compared to 2013.
Since initiating our return of capital programs in 2011, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Over this period of time, we've reduced our outstanding shares by 25%. We are additionally pleased to announce this morning that the actions of our board, raising our quarterly dividend by 26% to $0.12 per share and authorizing an additional $300 million for share repurchase.
With $144 million remaining on our existing authorization as of year-end, this brings us to a total of $444 million authorized for share repurchase. In sum, the competitiveness of our agencies and the high quality of our offerings continue to drive strong performance. The accomplishments of our agencies and our talent are also being increasingly recognized and awarded by our industry.
As we entered 2015, you can see in our report today that the overall tone of business remains solid in most markets around the world, including the U.S., the U.K. and several of the larger high-growth markets. The dynamic mix shifts we are witnessing in the media landscape also represent an opportunity for us and our industry.
Given these factors and the strength of our offerings, we believe we'll continue to see solid organic growth. There are key -- 2 key factors that temper our outlook compared to last year and therefore need to be called out. First, there's a volatile currency environment and its possible negative effect on client spending plans. Second, we have to consider those markets with continued macro headwinds, notably Europe.
In light of this environment, for 2015, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Our acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth, and the currency impact to our top line as well as to our operating expenses at current FX rates is expected to be approximately negative 4% for the year.
In line with this growth target and in order to build on the strong progress we made during 2014 in improving profitability, our 2015 target is 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. As in the past, as the year unfolds and we get more clarity around the macro issues that are creating uncertainty, we will review our perspective and report back to you during our regular calls.
We will, of course, continue to focus on the execution of our strategy, which is built on world-class creativity and digital expertise, strength in emerging markets and our increased focus on and success in delivering customized integrated solutions, combined as always with discipline on cost.
At this stage, I'll turn the things over to Frank for additional detail on our results."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 4.8%. U.S. organic growth was 3.4%. International growth was 6.4%, with growth i",2124,"Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 4.8%. U.S. organic growth was 3.4%. International growth was 6.4%, with growth in all regions, except Continental Europe.
Q4 operating profit was $433 million compared with $385 million a year ago before last year's restructuring charge. Operating profit increased 20% for the full year. Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago.
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.73 and $0.50 per share, excluding certain discrete tax items. For the full year, diluted EPS was $1.12 per share and $0.98 per share, excluding both the positive $0.16 per share impact of the Q4 tax items and the negative $0.02 per share impact of our charge in the second quarter for the early redemption of our 6.25% notes. This is an increase of 26% from 2013 earnings per share of $0.78.
We used $275 million for share repurchase during the year. Our board, this morning, once again, significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.12 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expense in detail on the slides that follow, as well as a couple of slides to clarify nonoperating adjustments.
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.21 billion, an increase of 4%. Compared to Q4 '13, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 230 basis points, while net acquisitions added 150 basis points. Resulting organic revenue increase was 4.8%.
With the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. For the full year, revenue growth of 5.8% consisted of 5.5% organic growth and 130 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 1%. It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $30 million compared to 2013, which is offset by $30 million decrease in our O&G expense.
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, growth in the fourth quarter was mainly at our Integrated Agency Network segment, which had 5.7% organic growth. The decrease in pass-through revenue weighed on reported growth at CMG, which grew 3.2% organically, excluding that effect, led by public relations and high single-digit growth in sports marketing. On the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see that both segments had very good growth rates for the full year, with 5.5% organic growth at IAN and 5.8% organic growth at CMG.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 3.4%, on top of 6.9% a year ago. Organic growth was approximately 5%, excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, which again are offset with lower expenses. We had strong domestic fourth quarter performance at our 3 global integrated networks, McCann, FCB and Lowe, as well as at Huge and Mediabrands. Health care continue to be a leading client growth sector, followed by food and beverage.
For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 4.7% and 5.8%, excluding the impact of pass-throughs, with increases across all major disciplines and nearly all agencies. Leading client sectors were once again health care and food and beverage, as well as auto and transportation and financial services.
Turning to the international markets. The U.K. grew 5.4% organically in Q4 and 10.6% for the full year. We had contributions from all of our agencies. Total revenue growth in the U.K. was 21%, which includes organic plus 5% from our acquisitions such as FCB, Inferno and Profero and another 5% attributable to the strength of the pound during the year.
In Continental Europe, the environment continued to be challenging. Our organic decrease in the quarter was 4.1% and included decreases in Germany, France and Italy. For the full year, revenue decreased 1.3% on an organic basis, slightly lower than the assumptions we factored into our planning as we enter 2014.
Including our acquisitions, revenue in the region increased 1.2%, excluding currency. In Asia Pac, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 12.8% in Q4. That was driven by double-digit increases in Australia, India and Singapore, as well as strong results from China. Mediabrands, public relations, McCann and R/GA led our growth, and these same agencies led our 8% organic growth in the region for the full year. For the year, we had double-digit growth in Australia, China, Singapore and Korea and more modest increase in India.
In Lat Am, we increased 11% organically in the quarter, with double-digit growth at Brazil and Argentina. We had growth across all of our agencies, including our marketing services offerings, our digital specialist, McCann, FCB and our media business. Full year growth was strong at 10.8%, on top of 10% a year ago.
In our Other Markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, organic growth was 11.7% in the quarter, driven by organic increases in the Middle East and South Africa.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.5%, corresponding to calendar year 2014.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1% compared to 4% revenue growth. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.4% compared to total revenue growth of 5.8%.
Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue for the full year was 64% compared to 63.8% in the prior year. It's important to point out that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which has offset dollar for dollar in lower O&G expense, results in some deleveraging in SRS and some leveraging of our O&G, while resulting in no impact at operating profit.
For the full year, our ratio of base payroll, benefits and tax expense to revenue was 52.6% compared with 52.9% a year ago, which is an improvement of 30 basis points, and improved 50 basis points, excluding the change in pass-through revenue.
Expense for temporary labor was 3.8% of revenue for the full year in 2014 compared to 3.6% a year ago. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2014 compared with the 1.1% in the prior year. Incentive expense was 3.5% of revenue for the full year 2014, reflecting higher performance-based accruals compared to a year ago due to this year's strong performance. Our other salaries and related category is 3.2% of revenue, which is the same level as our prior year.
At year-end, our total headcount was approximately 47,400, an increase of 4.4%, which is made up of 2% from acquisitions and 2% -- 2.4% from organic hiring. The increases were in higher growth areas of the portfolio, which last year included McCann, public relations and digital, as well as growth regions of the world and in support of a number of major new business wins.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 23% of Q4 revenue compared with 25.3% in Q4 '13. For the full year, compared to our revenue growth of 5.8%, total O&G expense increased only 50 basis points.
We had leverage across all of our O&G categories. For the full year, we had 40 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 20 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 20 basis points of professional fees. In addition, we had 50 basis points of leverage in our category of all other O&G expense as pass-through expenses decreased from a year ago, along with the related revenues. These expenses are mainly in our events and direct marketing disciplines.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects, with the most recent data point at 10.5%, we have come a long way. While pleased to achieve double-digit operating margin, we are -- we know that there is still much work to be done. We therefore remain highly focused on attaining our goal of competitive 13% operating margins.
Slide 9. For clarity on our year-end comparison, we have provided more detail on below-the-line adjustments in the quarter. This is the impact of our net tax benefits this year, along with the impact of the charge we took in Q4 '13.
This year, we had a net reversal of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in Europe. The net amount was $68 million, which is a positive to reported earnings in the quarter and the year. There were 2 primary drivers, both of which were noncash items. We reversed a previously established valuation allowance of $125 million due to our business tax planning actions. That benefit was partially offset by the establishment of a $57 million tax valuation allowance in other European markets due to our operating history.
The EPS benefit was $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter. Excluding these discrete items in the fourth quarter, as you can see on the slide, our effective Q4 tax rate was 37.1% compared to 30.1% in Q4 '13.
Slide 10 addresses the full year comparison. This picks up the impact of our second quarter charge for debt redemption, as well as Q4 items. As you can see, adjusted for those items, our effective tax rate for the year was 39.4%, which is in line with our indications earlier this year.
In 2013, the full year includes a charge for debt redemption. Our comparable 2013 adjusted tax rate was 36.2%. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison was $0.98 per share this year and $0.78 per share in 2013. And while there was clearly volatility around our effective tax rate, it's worth noting that our cash tax rate was again significantly lower. These adjustments also makes clear the impact of our share repurchase, with average diluted shares outstanding decreasing 4% from a year ago to 425 million.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 11. We ended the year with $1.67 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared with $1.64 billion a year ago. We returned more than $430 million to shareholders during the year through share repurchases and common stock dividends.
On Slide 12, we turn to cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was $1.05 billion compared with $1.02 billion a year ago. The comparison includes a seasonally strong contribution working capital. Our business tends to generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash from working capital in the first quarter.
For the full year, cash from operations was $670 million compared with $593 million in 2013. Investing activities in Q4 used $59 million, mainly for capital expenditures. For the full year, CapEx was $149 million, while net cash used in acquisitions was $68 million.
Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually. Financing activities used $169 million in Q4, mainly $127 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $39 million in common stock dividends.
For the full year, our financing activities used $344 million. That reflects $275 million to repurchase common stock and $159 million for dividends in our common shares, as well as lower bank borrowings. Additionally, we issued new debt that was partially offset by debt redemption. In 2014, our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the full year was $25 million.
On Slide 13, we show our debt decreasing from $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.73 billion at the end of 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, we issued $500 million of new 10-year notes at 4.2% and redeemed our 6.25% $350 million notes.
Slide 14 shows the total of our average basic plus diluted shares over the last few years. And at far right, it shows the total as of year-end 2014. This has been an area of strong progress for us, with our average total shares decreasing approximately 25% between 2010 and 2014. Our starting position for 2014 is $418 million on the right.
In summary, on Slide 15, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our team has executed very well with respect to supporting strong revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation, as evident in the key actions taken by our board today. That leaves as well positioned entering 2015.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

Well, as you can see from our results, 2014 was a very successful year in which we saw significant accomplishments in terms of performance in the marketplace and our financial results. We further strengthened our capital structure and built on our capital return programs while continuing to enhance the competitiveness of our offerings, with particular emphasis on digital and creative talent and capabilities. Importantly, we also expanded operating margin by 120 basis points.
Highlights of our performance included solid progress at both McCann and FCB, further market share growth at our best-in-class PR and sports marketing agencies within CMG and strong financial performance from our media operations. We also continue to see dynamic growth from our digital specialist agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across the portfolio.
We posted strong performance in emerging international markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, on top of outstanding growth in recent years. The competitiveness of our agencies was reflected in a very strong new business performance for the year. I believe it's fair to say that the quality of our offerings is at its highest level in at least a decade.
During 2014, this was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio in the form of awards from industry press, as well as our performance in the most important creative and effectiveness competitions in every marketing discipline.
We once again excelled in Cannes, where McCann kept up its strong momentum. FCB posted its best-ever performance and Lowe also showed well. We also performed strongly at the Effie Awards shows around the world. More recently, IPG agencies enjoyed the strongest showing of any holding company in the prestigious A-List by Advertising Age.
R/GA was the #1 ranked agency in 2014, and it became the first digital agency to ever top the A-List. Deutsch and Weber Shandwick were also named among the industry's top 4 agencies in terms of innovation, quality of work and success with clients and in new business.
Huge and Mullen were cited on the list of agency standouts, just outside the top 10, as was Lowe India, among international shops. And Harris Diamond, the CEO of McCann, was named Advertising Executive of the Year.
Across the range of our agencies, we're seeing good progress in terms of talent and the quality of work product. 2014 was a strong year for McCann, which saw a range of client wins, including additional fourth quarter assignments from Reckitt Benckiser, State Street Global Advisers and an integrated win on Oppenheimer Funds led by MRM. This came on the heels of integrated McCann wins on Choice Hotels, also with MRM, and Office Depot, working closely with UM.
FCB continues to improve performance, attract new talent and grow in standing with clients such as Nestlé, which awarded them new assignments from their Waters and Health & Wellness divisions, as well as Bacardi in China. The recent Michelob ULTRA win was evidence of increased vitality in the flagship Chicago office. FCB health care continues to shine and will continue to receive our support to build on their success.
At Lowe, we're pleased with the integration of Profero and with fourth quarter wins of Remy Martin and the CFA Institute to build on the additions of Lenovo and SEAT early in 2014. We continue to look for ways to bolster the agency's presence in the U.S., which is fundamental to sourcing large multinationals for the global network. The agency's capability as a creative powerhouse, with expertise in emerging markets, remain evident in a very strong relationship it continues to enjoy with Unilever.
Progress continued at CMG, led by the outstanding team at Weber Shandwick. The evolution of that agency into a digital and strategic leader across all disciplines has been remarkable. Golin is following suit, and the performance of Octagon reflects the shifts they are making to transform their passion points of sports and entertainment into powerful drivers of consumer engagement. The integration of Genuine, a leading digital shop acquired at mid-year, into Jack Morton, is going well, and we should see the benefits of that agency's capabilities going forward.
Mediabrands posted strong financial results in the quarter and continued to deliver on full range leading-edge traditional and digital capabilities, such as Cadreon and Reprise and Ansible, as well as strong specialist assets such as Orion Holdings, ID Media and our out-of-home offering, Rapport.
Fourth quarter wins included True Value at UM and Bose at Initiative. At a time of such dynamic change in terms of technology and media channels, the focus on the growth of programmatic platforms is understandable, yet we should not lose sight of the fact that what we ultimately provide to marketers is a consultive service and insights. So the key will continue to be our impartiality and our ability to apply consumer data to our clients' real-time business challenges so as to maximize the impact of their investments.
I've covered off the success we are seeing at R/GA and MRM. Huge also had a very strong year and has established itself as one of the country's most innovative digital agencies. A full range of digital capabilities is also what sets apart Mullen and Deutsch, particularly in their L.A. office. With the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday, this gives us a strong portfolio of integrated agencies that are thriving and can win business on their own, as well as take part in our customized multi-agency client solutions.
This focus on delivering open architecture solutions that integrate the best of our talent across the organization by means of customized client teams was once again a contributor to our results. We won the largest consolidation in the industry during 2014 when we prevailed in a hotly contested Microsoft review.
We also won a consolidation with one of Latin America's most important companies when we bested a number of our key competitors in the Grupo Bimbo pitch in Mexico. We saw many additional multi-agency opportunities come into the group, domestically and internationally. And we continue to improve our delivery of custom integrated solutions on a number of existing multinational clients.
Overall, our performance in 2014 is the result of a series of long-term strategic decisions, which we backed with significant investments over time. Talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, as well as building digital expertise in all our agencies, have been key drivers in the strong organic revenue performance we're seeing across the group.
We've also continued to invest behind our strength in the U.S. and in major emerging markets where we have strong and growing presence. During 2014, we saw a further progress across a range of areas related to financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability put us on track to achieving our goal of 13% operating margin. Our return of capital programs continued to positively impact results, and we crossed the $2 billion threshold in terms of total return to shareholders since 2011.
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on our robust capital return programs. The latter is evident by our board's actions today, which further increase our dividend by 26% and provided for our current authorization in excess of $440 million for share repurchase.
We're well positioned as we go into 2015. The value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant in today's dynamic and complex consumer media landscape. Despite a range of geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions around the world, the general tone of the business remains solid. We are therefore targeting the 3% to 4% organic growth for the year and improvement in operating margin between 80 and 100 basis points.
Coupled with strong capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on a strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. We thank you for your time and continued support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on the next call.
At this point, I'll open it up to questions."

The fact that we were down in 2014 was a little bit below our plan. With the uncertainty out there, it's not wise for us to count on a big recovery there. So what -- we are refreshing our talent, we've made some changes in personnel in Continental Europe. We did some acquisitions certainly with Inferno and Profero and a couple of smaller acquisitions, and we continue to look to bolster our competitiveness there. But we're basically keeping an eye in there without making any big bets in terms of strong recovery in terms of our forecast for the rest of the year. Our leverage in terms of improving our margin continues to be focusing on our people, our creative products, our competitive offerings and obviously, converting that revenue into 30% target that we always said. It was nice to see, in 2014, we converted it to 30% ratio. So when you look at our assumptions in terms of 3% to 4%, that's how we come to the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement for 2015. We're coming to the year of 2015 with some tailwinds because we were net new business positive in 2014. And of course, Alexia, I know you're going to ask how are we doing so far. And for 2015, we continue to be net new business positive. In terms of those tailwinds, I think you'll see the effect of those more in the first half the year. And in the second half of the year, we'll see some cycling down, absent any new businesses wins in the meantime. And so I think it's more focusing on our cost. We've instituted a number of additional programs to make sure that our SRS ratios don't get out of line. I mean, clearly, that's where we see the biggest leverage. We did see an improvement in base benefits, as Frank outlined in his discussion. We did have -- we had a good performance. So therefore, incentives went up a bit, and that accounted for some -- the higher number on the SRS ratio. But we continue to be very careful in terms of how we add headcount, and we're gaining efficiencies. We're -- for example, in McCann, we have Craft and we're using production facilities with great efficiency on a worldwide basis. These led to greater margins for us in bringing those dollars. We keep them in-house as opposed to going out, and we see a lot of that happening in our other agencies as well."

So we look at existing AOR contracts. As the year progresses and as our clients begin to feel more comfortable, that's when we start seeing some incremental spend, which frankly helps us in terms of higher-margin business. The tone is solid. Is there concern? Of course, there is. We're in a global business right now, and there are effects of currency which affects or potentially affects our business. That's why we tempered some of our assumptions going into 2015. It's not the translation effect on our P&L that we tempered because we're matched from a revenue and expense point of view. It's the tone of the effect of these currencies on our clients and their spending and how that potentially converts to our business. But the tone of the business is solid. Our clients are working with us in terms of our plans for the year. They're spending money. Some of the money is coming. I know, one of the questions is always how much of it is in TV versus digital. We're seeing a tremendous focus on allocating media dollars and where it should go. And our offerings in media brands are attuned into doing exactly that. The use of Cadreon, the use of our tools and planning techniques and real time, we continue to invest in those because clients want to know whether it should be digital, whether it should be TV, how it should be allocated and can they change it quickly. So we're working very closely with our clients and of course, programmatic and automation are part of that. So I think the question is whether it's digital versus TV, I think, we've seen certainly an impact on TV. If you just look at the results of the media owners in 2014 and the challenges they face in 2015, and our job continues to be help drop our clients navigate through that. So we have the tools, we have the talent, our clients are talking to us. They're not pulling back per se. The issue is how much more they're going to spend, and the pressure is on us to be efficient and for us to be responsive in terms of moving the needle, and that's what we're going to do. So we feel good about our forecast, and I think it's a realistic assumption for us to use going into 2015."

But putting that aside, our biggest bucket is SRS improvement. So Frank and his -- the entire financial organization and of all our units are focusing on those SRS ratios. Now the good news is, as we develop new business, we ramp up and that causes us to throw those ratios a little bit out of track. And frankly, that's not a bad thing to happen, okay? If we're investing with new business, it's not atypical for us when we win a new business to have to ramp up and add 50 to 100 people in terms of staffing, and that staffing usually comes ahead of revenue. So there's timing issues in there. But the fundamental basic benefits, if you will, in tax, we saw our 50 basis point improvement in 2014 and for '15, we're going to continue to be very careful with that. And yes, the answer is ultimately we have to get those SRS numbers down, and that's where our focus is going to be, John."

But we have 3 global networks that are very competitive, and on top of that, our marketing disciplines and media businesses and so on, and we're very well positioned. So if there is a recovery in Europe, I think we will participate. Some of our pullback in Europe, again, was client-specific. 11% of our business is in Continental Europe. That's good and bad depending on how you look at it. And so as a result, if 1 or 2 clients pulled back, it has a bigger impact on our results. And we saw that in 2014, which is frankly one of the reasons we missed a little bit in terms of our planning process. But we're well positioned. We continue to invest in Continental Europe in terms of talent, and that's where we have to. And we're looking for good organic growth as the recovery comes back. But we're monitoring it and we will be looking at efficiencies, whether it be combining agencies -- not agencies, but combining some local situations. We are always looking at that."

Look -- and as we have, look, we continue to believe that our model of agnostic advice in terms of where clients should be putting their money is the proper model, okay? I think there's no question that some of our competitors, as you allude to, would take inventory position on the digital assets, and they're using right hand and left hand. And I think as this rolls out, clients are going to see the profits that are being made from inventory owned. Then we feel that, that's inconsistent with our model of being independent in terms of how we allocate media dollars on behalf of our clients. Now have we seen -- do clients tell us that they prefer our model? Obviously, yes. If you look at our performance, we had great performance at Mediabrands and that whole model isn't lost on our clients. I mean, the reason they're our clients, among other things, is exactly that, that they view us as being their partner in terms of advising where they put their money. I've said this before and I continue to say it. If, as this rolls out -- if, in the marketplace, it is not viewed as we view it, then obviously we're going to relook at how we do this. We do, do it on the barter of Orion and the barter business where it's disclose upfront, and we're seeing very nice margins on it. But right now, our model is consistent. And yes, I think larger multinational clients, one of the reasons they bring some of this programmatic in-house is because they don't trust our business, not ours per se, I'm speaking generically, in terms of the transparency that goes into this pricing in this black box that they're dealing with. And I think the fact that there's inventory owned being sold doesn't help. I know they can disclose it, and I know they argue that they're buying more efficiently and so on. But in terms of pricing, we don't see that. We're being -- we don't do it, and we're very competitive on the pricing side of the business. So we believe our role is to be agnostic, and that we do think our clients choose us and that's why we stick to this model. And frankly, when I was a client, I would look at it the same way. I find it difficult to think that the wall that they claim they put up and the large margins that some of them claim they're getting on that isn't at the cost of that advice that they're -- I'm getting on the buying side. So that's my personal view on it. But that's -- we continue to look at it. It's a reasonable question. By the way, you're seeing a big ramp -- might as well do this. You're seeing a big ramp up in terms of the organic growth and potentially some margin on this. As you cycle through that, that advantage isn't going to be there on reported numbers, right? And I do think the margin on that business is going to shrink because clients there are just going to want greater transparency on it, and that's where the margin impact will be -- will come down, so..."

So when we bring in the extra services, it's all with a view towards moving the needle and how we enhance their margin and frankly, at the same time, it helps us. I think that pressure is there. It will continue to be there. It will be on the media side just evidenced by, as you note in your write-ups, the big client reviews typically are occurring on the media side of the business because they continue to believe there's pricing advantages by putting that stuff up for bids and review.

As gasoline prices fall, the consumer has more money in the pocket, discretionary spending in terms of consumer goods products and things like that. Have I seen a big change in their forecast as a result of that? No. But does everyone kind of use that as a bit of a buffer in terms of the expectations on the economy? I would say the answer is yes. And Barry, the concern we raise is of uncertainties. It's not that I can specifically point to a client and say, because of currency, we're cutting our spend by 10%. This is the beginning of the year. This business -- just like I was talking before with Greg, this business is a journey over the year. And all we can do is take our best shot right now in terms of bottoms up and what we overlay in terms of potential wins and God forbid, losses. But I think the tone is solid, and that's the takeaway, I think, from this call. And some clients are a little more concerned than others. And that has to do with their geographic locations. So it's a legitimate question. I think all of our competitors have raised it, and it's more of a sense of making sure we're cautious before we put numbers out there because we always want to make sure that we at least meet or exceed the numbers we put out, Barry."

I think we've added -- I know we've added 3 very capable independent board members. The finance committee, a lot of what the finance committee is doing is what the audit committee was doing. We always look at strategic plans, capital allocation and costs and how we target and so on. So the finance committee is a typical committee, frankly. The number of the boards that I sit on have separate finance committees. So since our focus is on making sure we achieve our margins, the emphasis on focusing on that for the finance committee is going to be welcomed. And knowing our board, because we usually view these things as a full board, I would suspect the attendance at our finance committee will probably be made up of our entire board. So I think, well, it does show that our continued emphasis on getting to those margins that we put out there."

We'd like to thank you for joining us as we review our results for the quarter. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by the Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. Organic revenue grew 5.7% in Q1 on top of 6.6% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines and most geographic regions. 
It's worth noting that in the quarter, acquisitions added 1.1% to growth and currency translation was a 4.4% drag on revenue. 
Given the further strengthening of the dollar during Q1, currency translation would be a full year headwind of 5.1% at recent exchange rates. 
It's also important to note that the course of our revenue and expenses are evenly matched as current exchange rate, we expect currency would be neutral to our percentage operating margins for the year. 
Operating profit was $8 million compared to a loss of $12 million a year ago. As you all know, our first quarter was seasonally small in terms of revenue While cost are distributive fairly evenly throughout the year. 
Our first positive Q1 result in terms of profit in over a decade is, therefore, yet another milestone that points to the continued progress at Interpublic. 
During the quarter, we achieved leverage on both our principal expense categories, driving breakeven earnings per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the same period a year ago. 
Turning to more color on revenue. Our growth reflects both increases with existing clients, as well as new business wins. We were led by increases in the health care, food and beverage, tech and telecom and retail sectors. 
In the U.S., organic growth was 6.1% with outstanding performance across a broad range of agencies and disciplines. International organic growth was also strong at 5.1% with nearly all major regions contributing. We had increases in Asia Pac, the U.K. and the Middle East, as well as a welcome return to growth in Continental Europe. Lat Am decreased less than 1% on an organic basis. 
Turning to expenses and margin. Total operating expenses increased 1.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.4%. 
As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 120 basis points. Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority, and we were able to execute against that objective again during the quarter. 
Our capital structure also continued to be a source of value creation. Earlier this month, S&P raised our credit rating to investment grade. This is the culmination of an extended process and reflects significant positive development at IPG in recent years. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 major credit rating agencies according and as an important recognition of financial strength and fulfilling a long-standing management objective. 
As previously announced in February, our Board approved a 26% increase to our quarterly dividend and authorized an additional 300 million share repurchase program. 
During Q1, we repurchased 2.5 million shares, using $51 million. Since the inception of our repurchase program in February 2011, we repurchased 124 million shares at an average cost of $12.63 per share. 
We are encouraged that our performance in the quarter continues to reflect the competitiveness of our agencies. The quality of our offerings reflects the full spectrum of digital services within advertising, marketing services, as well as media agencies was once again a key contributor to our strong results. 
Our strategic focus remains on delivering outstanding creativity, top-tier digital capabilities embedded across the portfolio and on crafting integrated solutions for our clients. 
This culmination will ensure that we continue to be called upon by clients for higher value services, thereby, allowing us to grow and win in today's world of dynamic technology-enabled consumer marketing. 
Given the strength of our offerings and our first quarter performance, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our financial targets for the full year. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for some additional details on our results. After his remarks, I'll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of the business to be followed by the Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Organic growth was 5.7% in the first quarter, 6.1% in the U.S. and 5.1% in our international markets. Q1 operating profit was $8 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an improvement of $20 million compared to last year. 
Operating margin was 50 basis points compared with negative 70 basis points in Q1 2014. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow. Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.68 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.4%. Compared to Q1, 2014, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 4.4%, while net acquisitions added 1.1%. The resulting organic revenue increase was 5.7%. 
With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. 
FX change have minimal impact on our change in operating profit and margin in the quarter. 
It's also worth noting that our past due revenue decreased slightly compared to Q1 2014, which is offset by a decrease in our O&G expense. 
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 6.7% at our Integrated Agency Network segment with contributions from all major disciplines with notable increases at all 3 of our global networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe. 
CMG grew 1.6% organically with continued solid growth in our PR businesses. On a net basis, growth at CMG was in the mid-single digits. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic growth of 6.1% was broad-based across a number of our agencies, led by McCann, FCB, Deutsche, Mediabrands and CMG. 
Leading client sectors were health care, tech and telecom and food and beverage. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 6.4% organically, which is on top of 10.7% a year ago. 
We had strong growth at all 3 global integrated networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe, as well as our digital specialist, Huge and R/GA.  Most client sectors grew well, notably retail, consumer goods and food and beverage. 
Continental Europe increased 3.5% to 5% organically on top of 3.8% a year ago. We were led by Mediabrands, Lowe and R/GA. 
Geographically, these results included growth in Spain and moderate decreases in both Germany and France. 
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q1 organic growth was 6%, with increases in many national markets led by China, India and Singapore. Lowe and McCann were very strong across the region, as were Huge and R/GA. 
In Lat Am, we decreased 0.7% organically on top of 18% growth a year ago, as well as 16% growth in Q1 2013. The decrease was driven by increasingly challenged economy in Brazil and the timing of client spending, partially offset by growth in other markets such as Argentina and Mexico.  Our other markets group increased 10.4% organically in Q1, driven mainly by growth in the Middle East. 
On Slide 6, which are the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.4%. 
Moving to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the first quarter, total operating expenses increased 1.2% from a year ago compared to our reported revenue increase of 2.4%. Our Q1 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 72.5% this year compared with 72.6% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. It is important to note that the decrease in past due revenue, which is offset dollar-for-dollar and lower O&G expense results in some deleveraging on SRS and some leveraging of our O&G while resulting in no impact on operating profit. 
Adjusted for the change in past due revenue, our SRS leverage is 40 basis points. Our base salaries benefit tax was 60.5% of revenue compared with 60.3% a year ago, an increase of 20 basis points. Expense for temporary labor was 3.9% of revenue, the same level as the year ago.  Incentive expense as a percentage of revenue was also unchanged from the year ago and severance expense improved 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
All other salaries and related expense was 3.2% of revenue compared with 3.3% a year ago. Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,000. Headcount increased during the quarter by approximately 1% from Q4 of 2014 on higher growth areas of the portfolio and to support new business wins. 
Turning to Office and General expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 27% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 100 basis points for the year ago with leverage across most major components of. We had 50 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 30 basis points of leverage on telecom, office supplies and travel and 30 basis points on our category of all other O&G expense as past due expenses decreased. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.7%, which reflects solid progress towards our full year target of 80 to 100 basis points. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the first quarter with $741 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level of seasonal and it tends to peak at year-end. 
On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $797 million compared with $726 million a year ago. Operating cash flow is also seasonal as our business generate significant cash in working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in working capital in the first quarter. 
During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $801 million compared with the use of $723 million a year ago. Investing activities in Q1 used $20 million for capital expenditures. 
Financing activity used $51 million, mainly in capital returns to shareholders, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings. 
We used $51 million per share repurchases and our common stock dividend was $49 million. Typically, the pace of our share repurchases is geared to our fourth quarter when our cash flows are strongest. 
Our net decrease in cash to marketable securities for the quarter was $926 million compared with $866 million a year ago. 
On Slides 11, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.76 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Organic revenue performance was not only competitive, it looks to have come in at the top end of our sector. It's noting that digital services across the group were significant contributors to organic revenue growth. 
Other highlights in terms of organic growth include the fact that we saw contributions from our cost of portfolio, including all 3 global networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe. 
Performance at Mediabrands and at our PR agencies continue to be strong. Asia and the U.K. grew well, and we saw positive growth quarter in Continental Europe. The deceleration we experienced in Lat Am largely reflects macroeconomic issues in Brazil, as well as the fact that we were facing difficult comps in that region. 
We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management, and we remain focused on converting the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions should ensure that we maintained a very high level of our professional offerings.  We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders. 
Moving on to the tone of the business. What we are hearing from our operators and in our conversations with major multinational clients is that there is a consistent commitment to investing behind brands as companies seek to drive their business forward. We are seeing areas of macro uncertainties such as Brazil, Russia and certain markets in the Middle East. Of course, it's still early in the year with only 3 months in the books at this point, but the overall environment is such that we continue to see sufficient opportunities for us to achieve our stated growth objectives for the year. 
The marketing mix that is right for each of our clients in order to meet a range of marketing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. We therefore need to be able to customize our approach for each specific situation as we continued to have at our disposal all of the tools required to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace. 
Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are tracking solid activity at most of our agencies. The first quarter saw some notable wins, and we're involved in the full range of major opportunities that are currently being contested. Other than those, we are conflicted and unable to participate. 
Our performance in new business were very strong last year, and we want to keep building on that result. Highlights at our agencies include a very strong quarter for McCann with continued new business momentum, increased levels of integration within Worldgroup and in working with a range of IPG agencies, as well as a very strong showing in terms of industry honors, including the recent news from the global awards that McCann has been named the industry's second -ranked network in terms of marketing effectiveness. 
Lowe ranked #4 globally on the index in terms of marketing effectiveness and one of its campaigns for Unilever was recognized as the best in the world in terms of driving marketplace results. 
The integration of Profero continues to go well, and that's providing Lowe with a strong digital partner on a range of client engagements. 
As previously mentioned, our focus with Lowe remains to scale the network more broadly in the U.S. and unlock potential growth in the U.S. base multinationals. 
Progress at FCB continued to be evident in these results, especially domestically and in the U.K., with the merger with Inferno has been a success. The agency's flagship Chicago office won significant assignments during the quarter with in Bev, and more recently, the New York Agency was named AUR for bondage. We see further promise of the FCB health operations especially as we add the ICC Lowe assets to that portfolio. 
At Mediabrands, the management succession has been quite seamless with Henry moving from his global COO role to CEO. Initiative NUM are strong in competitive networks. We continue to be a leader in addressing the changes that technology is bringing to the media landscape as evident by Cadreon's recent announcement that it will be the first in programmatic radio. Our investment in Samba TV and Magnus' global creation of consortium of 15 cable networks to enable targeted automated buying of TV inventory. 
It bids [indiscernible] to hear that our overall organic growth results do not benefit from taking inventory positions in media, particularly the programmatic space, where our offering is strong but predicated on a whole consultant of model in which our impartiality and expertise are key differentiators. 
CMG agencies continue to perform well in the quarter, led by public relations. We will consistently win market share, new assignments from client such as Unilever, Mattel, Sealed Air, United Nations, and most recently, the American Cancer Society, as well as major awards, including Weber Shandwick, once again, being named Agency of the Year by PR. 
Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Coming off outstanding overall performance in 2014, Mollen and Deutsche continues to be leader in the marketplace. Carmichael Lynch added U.S. Bank after a highly competitive review that just concluded in early April. 
Along with the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday, all of our domestic independence provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged creative, digital experiential, analytics and social capabilities. 
Huge, MRM and R/GA are all leaders in the marketplace. MRM is among the leading industry's top global digital networks, with 30 offices in over 20 world markets. The growth at Huge has been significant and the agency continues to be known for its best-in-class capabilities in the area of marketing utility. R/GA remains the leader in innovations that have defined digital marketing since its inception. 
We are also very proud that this year, the Confit Festival recognized Bob Greenberg with the most prestigious honor for and I quote, ""having helped show the way forward the industry."" 
Some among our peers have approached digital primarily by means of headline grabbing, M&A transactions and a silent approach to this key competencies. 
We continue to see the benefits of our long-term approach on investing in talent and embedding digital expertise and capabilities throughout our portfolio of agencies. We believe this is consistent with the changing dynamics of media usage and consumer behavior. 
This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a client-centric connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance. 
As we look to the balance of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring, and we will, of course, remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. 
While first quarter results were quite positive, it bears repeating that it is our seasonally smallest quarter and there's still work ahead for us to deliver the year. 
At this point, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieved our organic growth target of 3% to 4% and to improve operating margin by 80 to 100 basis points. 
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we have been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I thank you for your time, and open up the floor to questions."

Look, now that we're investment-grade from all 3 rating agencies, what it does give us is additional flexibility on liquidity. It should open up an opportunity for us to utilize commercial paper. That will add to our existing lines of credit that we have, which are almost $1 billion. So clearly, that gives us financial flexibility as we go forward. We can't say when, but we are looking at all opportunities in commercial paper. And as that freeze up cash in our balance sheet, that will be factored into our needs for the business in terms of acquisitions and certainly, dividends and buybacks will be reflective of our balance sheet strength and excess cash we have. So I think it gives us additional cushion, if you will, as we move forward. We still have a significant amount of authorized buyback from our Board, a $390-somewhat million. And obviously, at this point, that's sufficient, and we will continue to monitor that as we go forward. We're committed to returning our cash to our shareholders in both dividends, as well as buyback methodologies."

Now this whole issue of ADBs and rebates is not new to IPG, some 10 years ago, you may recall that we made that as an important issue as we became sore Bains compliant. At that point in time, you recall, we set up a significant amount of liability to pay back to our clients, and we embarked on a full transparency program within IPG to make sure that this transparency and that any rebates will be probably reflected in our contracts and given to our clients. So consistent with that, in those market, we'll -- first of all, in the U.S., we had no rebates and therefore, it's not an issue for us in the U.S. And in those markets where there are rebates, we've, in fact, encouraged by our clients to get as much volume rebates as possible. And our contracts are clear that those rebates belong to our clients or how they instruct us to treat those rebates. So we are extremely comfortable with the notion that we don't have any issues with respect to that. And in fact, all of our contracts are fully transparent and consistent with that notion that we established 10 years ago. So we're comfortable there. On the issue of Brazil, of course, we're disappointed in what happened in Brazil. I might point out that we, in fact, instigated that review prior to what the news that you saw in the media. And in fact, we had an extensive review of what was going on in Brazil, and we took action internally and the fact that we dismissed 1 or 2 employees within that organization. And based on the reviews that we've seen, this has been an isolated case of those 1 or 2 individuals. We have been cooperating with all the authorities with respect to that. We do not see a systemic issue here with respect to that, this is the action of 1 or 2 individuals. From a financial point of view, the numbers that are involved are not material to both IPG and our revenue numbers and our profitability, and we are following up on this very carefully and cooperating. We do not believe that this is systemic issue for us in Brazil and we're cooperating as best we can. By the way, part of your question might be that we did see a decline in Brazil this year, that had nothing to do with this particular issue. With the decline client in Sioux Falls, one is, we had a very strong comp versus last year well in double digits; and two, the macroeconomic environment in Brazil is difficult at the current time."

So I guess, my question is, as you kind of settle into that, we are in a period of unprecedented change in an unprecedented short period of time in marketing and media. Can you take your focus, or do you take your focus and shift it a little longer term? And whatever -- can you talk a little bit about like in 5 years, how does IPG need to be different?

It's interesting, I just addressed -- Harris had a global meeting of the McCann Worldgroup that's 500 people down in Florida. It was great meeting and I was addressing the very issues that you're talking about. First of all, we don't settle in, okay? This business, as you know, is very difficult. And if you settle in and anything, you lose. So we are continually focusing on, as you pointed out, keeping the back door closed. And if you look at -- as I answered a question before, of our top 20 clients, we had very nice organic revenue growth from those position clients. And clearly, the fact that we were keeping the back door closed is one of those reasons. And we do not take clients for granted. Quite frantically, the mantra around here is that we treat existing clients as if we're pitching them for new business because that's the way we should treat existing clients. And settling in is hardly a thing to do when we had this large fragmented media environment, very competitive from our clients in terms of prices and so on. And our main mantra is going to be, we have to be client-centric. And with that means we have to continue to focus on the needs of our clients. And in order to do that, we have to invest in talent, we have to invest in all the technology that's out there, we have to provide integrated offerings because clients are looking for one plays or places that gives them the edge of on a competitive situation. And clearly, media, digital, talent, creative, all come together finally, in this business. For years, it's always been siloed. And now, if we don't provide an integrated offering, clients will look for it elsewhere. So we are not taking anything for granted. Obviously, we're very pleased with both the last year's results and the first quarter, but we are constantly focusing on how to be better. We don't have to be bigger, but we have to be best-in-class in terms of meeting the needs of our clients. And that is what our operators are focused on, and the results of that, you're seeing in organic growth that we're having and the margin improvement because we're still focused on narrowing that gap. So I think the key to the future of IPG is not being the biggest, we have to be client-centric, we have to be the place where talent wants to go. One of the things that I really am pleased about is the fact that we've been able to recruit high-caliber talents across all of our networks. And frankly, we like the fact that IPG is viewed as a good place to be within our peer group because of the fact that we are client-centric, and we are focused on meeting the needs of the clients directly. Other than that, we don't pay attention to it, David."

We have, historically, been different than our competitor, certainly more recently on the issue of taking inventory. The reason that there's gross versus net with respect to some of our competitors is that they take inventory on their own behalf and then, in essence, sell that inventory to our -- to their clients. We act as, in essence, agents for our clients. We do not take inventory. And as a result, when you see our growth versus net, the only item that affects our gross versus net is our experiential and passed through type expenses. And by the way, those expenses do not carry margin, along with it. So we do not have a gross up in our organic revenue that reflects media owned. And it is our stated policy, and frankly, we believe that being agnostic in the market basis is competitive advantage to us versus our competitors because it's hard to be an adviser went on one hand, you're giving them advice as to where they should place their media dollars and then on the other hand, you have an inventory component that you are an equity interest in getting rid of it at a profit. So we believe that it's a distinction that we will maintain in the marketplace. Now if, as some of our competitors say, it makes no difference as long as the net of buying and effectiveness is there, if we see the marketplace develop over a period of time where, in fact, that is recognized and not giving us an advantage in terms of meeting the needs of our clients, then we will rethink it. But right now, as recently as this month, we looked at that again, and we believe, as you'll see in some of the pictures, that taking that inventory position is not consistent with our overall model as being agnostic in the marketplace. And frankly, if I were a consumer, that's the way I would look at it, so that's our strategy. And the accounting follows your business practice, and therefore, our accounting does not require us to grow anything other than the pass-throughs that we have. As far CMG, I'll let Frank talk about CMG."

Obviously, the Russian markets are not the strongest right now. But recently, I've actually had some direct conversations with our clients because frankly, for years now, we've been talking to our partner in Russia. And in fact, we've got some approval in Russia for us to do a transaction with respect to our partner on some of the properties there with enabling us to have better control of the quality of the product with respect to our multinational clients in Russia. And we're planning on going forward with that transaction. So you might say, gee, in this environment, why are you doing that in Russia? And the answer is, our clients still believe that Russia is an important market and consistent with that, it's important for us to have the top talent and resources servicing those clients in Russia. So we're going forward with our transaction with ADV. I have say it, it's at achievable price, obviously, in terms of both the movement of the currency, as well as the economics in Russia, and we took advantage of that. But we are still moving forward and believe Russia is an important market. And frankly, it's a place that we still believed we have to be there to service our multinational clients. Brazil, everyone knows, is going through a difficult time right now, and it was a pullback when we saw up in our multinational larger global agencies down there. It was partially offset by other areas in Latin America that were positive, Mexico, for example. But Brazil, we're watching very carefully. We hope to return to growth in Brazil throughout the year. But the benefit of being a multinational and global service provider that we are where one region becomes a little difficult. Fortunately there are other regions that are strong. What I'm particularly pleased to see is the growth in India. We went through a period in India where the growth wasn't there during the elections. And now that Modi is in place and things are happening, we have double-digit growth, almost double-digit growth in India. So I think that's a positive sign. And obviously, China continues to grow for us at a double-digit rate. And of course, we are very strong in the U.S. So we're watching Brazil carefully. We still have top-tier of talent in our agencies down there are best-in-class. And as they Brazil will get through this. Look the growth of the middle-class in Brazil isn't real, and I think eventually with all the events, the Olympics, and so on, I think we'll see a snap back in Brazil once this all happens. On our balance sheet, we've always said we wanted to be strong, have a strong balance sheet, maybe that's part of the DNA of our company given the difficulties we had many years ago. And yes, there might be a little room in our leverage right now. And frankly, we would wait to make sure that we will finally get S&P over the finish line. And we will take a hard look in terms of our leverage and use, as I said, of the commercial paper market. And then maybe some opportunity for us in terms of buybacks. But we make business decision in terms of what we do with our cash, and that cash has decided either it goes through reinvesting in our business, whether it be strategic acquisitions, investments in talent or just overall investment in our businesses versus returning it to our shareholders. And if we return it to our shareholders, we'll take a look at the mix between dividends and buybacks. And obviously, we're very sensitive to the needs of our investors. And, in fact, every investor meeting we have, we ask them what their preference versus dividend versus buybacks, and we'll listen to our investors and we'll respond accordingly. The good news is, we will have the financial flexibility to do both. And what that mix is, will be decided by the marketplace and the needs of our businesses. Frank agree."

Just any color you could give on the puts and takes where you see relative net opportunities versus where you might be defending maybe a little bit more business might be helpful. And then just second, you've given good color in terms of the margins, in terms of where the leverage is coming from especially adjusting for things like pass-throughs. I guess, just from a business perspective, as you look across your agencies, are there certain things, which you're seeing that's driving the leverage growth in terms of greater share of wallet from existing clients or just better utilization of personnel individual basis or just hitting more performance incentives across your contracts, just anything from a business perspective that you're seeing as you look across your agencies, which is starting to kick in for you."

You did see the announcement of P&G, for example, they're anticipating cutting agency fees, if you will, by a significant amount. Clients are all -- and it's not new to the industry, our clients are always looking for more for less. And what we have to be able to do is twofold: One, the most important thing is we have to show that we're adding value to what we're delivering. And therefore, we have to be responsive to the effectiveness -- the creativity and effectiveness of the work that we do. And then we have to be able to measure it and be accountable for it. So I think the pressure is much greater now given that these tools are out there for measurement to prove the return on investment with respect to marketing dollars. And we're in a position to be able to do that and clients appropriately are asking to see that return on investment. And at the same time, they're looking to have savings and be able to show that the effectiveness of what they're spending is greater and spending less also gives them a similar response rate. And frankly, that's where we add value. If we can show that if you spend dollars in one place versus another and the one that's cheaper is as effective, if not better, then it's a win-win. We add value, we get paid for the value that we're adding. Clients show effectiveness and market share, and they spend less. And that is going to be a dialogue between us and our clients forever. And as these tools become sharper, as media plays more and more an importance in terms of the integrated offering, we have to have the best talent, tools and resources and scale in order to be able to make that happen. And that's the dialogue that's going on every day with our clients. And frankly, when I was a client, that's what I would do, and that's what's happening. And we're being responsive for it. And if you look at our organic growth, that's a good indication that we're able to overcome and be able to have those conversations. As far as pitchers, I think the big pitches that are out there are principally media. And every couple of years, every multinational clients looks at their media agencies and puts it through a pitch and a lot of these pitches are focusing on efficiencies, which is exactly what I just said. And so you see Coca-Cola having a media pitch. You have Unilever having a media pitch. These are global clients. L'Oreal is having a media pitch. These are global clients that not necessarily aren't happy with the services that they're getting, but they want to make sure they're optimizing the use of their media dollars in an efficient way and moving the needle, and we're responsive. We have a good track record in those pitches, and we expect to see that continue. On the creative side, we do have a couple of big pitches coming up, particularly contractual pitches. For example, the Army, which is a mandatory review and the Navy has a mandatory review. Both of which we've been successful in retaining and obviously we hope to do the same moving forward. And on the other side, there are pitches out there where we are what we call opportunities because we aren't in those pitches, we aren't existing clients relationships and this is an opportunity. For example, Chrysler has a digital pitch out there, and we're participating in that one. So yes, the marketplace it has -- and by the way, there are a fair amount of pitches out there that aren't public, and those are the ones that we have existing relationships where we're looking for the largest share of the wallet. So I think that bodes well for us, frankly, in the industry and there are these opportunities where we can get to go head-to-head with our competitors and show where we add value. So it's a pretty exciting time."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance, frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by the Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. Organic revenue grew 5.7% in Q1 on top of 6.6% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines and most geographic regions. It's worth noting that in the quarter, acquisitions added 1.1% to growth and currency translation was a 4.4% drag on revenue. Given the further strengthening of the dollar during Q1, currency translation would be a full year headwind of 5.1% at recent exchange rates. It's also important to note that because our revenue and expenses are evenly matched at current exchange rate, we expect currency would be neutral to our percentage operating margin for the year. 
Operating profit was $8 million compared to a loss of $12 million a year ago. As you all know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue while cost are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Our first positive Q1 result in terms of profit in over a decade is, therefore, yet another milestone that points to the continued progress at Interpublic. During the quarter, we achieved leverage on both our principal expense categories, driving break-even earnings per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the same period a year ago. 
Turning to more color on revenue. Our growth reflects both increases with existing clients as well as new business wins. We were led by increases in the health care, food and beverage, tech and telecom and retail sectors. In the U.S., organic growth was 6.1% with outstanding performance across a broad range of agencies and disciplines. International organic growth was also strong at 5.1% with nearly all major regions contributing. We had increases in Asia Pac, the U.K. and the Middle East as well as a welcome return to growth in Continental Europe. LatAm decreased less than 1% on an organic basis. 
Turning to expenses and margin. Total operating expenses increased 1.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.4%. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 120 basis points. Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority. And we were able to execute against that objective again during the quarter. 
Our capital structure also continued to be a source of value creation. Earlier this month, S&P raised our credit rating to investment grade. This is the culmination of an extended process and reflects significant positive development at IPG in recent years. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 major credit rating agencies according us an important recognition of financial strength and fulfilling a long-standing management objective. 
As previously announced in February, our Board approved a 26% increase to our quarterly dividend and authorized an additional 300 million share repurchase program. During Q1, we repurchased 2.5 million shares, using $51 million. Since the inception of a repurchase program in February 2011, we repurchased 124 million shares at an average cost of $12.63 per share. 
We are encouraged that our performance in the quarter continues to reflect the competitiveness of our agencies. The quality of our offerings across the full spectrum of digital services within our advertising, marketing services as well as media agencies was once again a key contributor to our strong results. Our strategic focus remains on delivering outstanding creativity, top-tier digital capabilities embedded across the portfolio and on crafting integrated solutions for our clients. This culmination will ensure that we continue to be called upon by clients for higher-value services, thereby, allowing us to grow and win in today's world of dynamic, technology-enabled consumer marketing. Given the strength of our offerings and our first quarter performance, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our financial targets for the full year. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for some additional details on our results. After his remarks, I'll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of the business, to be followed by the Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Organic growth was 5.7% in the first quarter, 6.1% in the U.S. and 5.1% in our international markets. Q1 operating profit was $8 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an improvement of $20 million compared to last year. Operating margin was 50 basis points compared with negative 70 basis points in Q1 2014. 
Turning to Slide 3. You'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow. Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.68 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.4%. Compared to Q1 2014, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 4.4% while net acquisitions added 1.1%. The resulting organic revenue increase was 5.7%. 
With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. FX change had minimal impact on our change in operating profit and margin in the quarter. It is also worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased slightly compared to Q1 2014, which is offset by a decrease in our O&G expense. 
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 6.7% at our Integrated Agency Network segment with contributions from all major disciplines with notable increases at all 3 of our global networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe. CMG grew 1.6% organically with continued solid growth in our PR businesses. On a net basis, growth at CMG was in the mid-single digits. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic growth of 6.1% was broad-based across a number of our agencies, led by McCann, FCB, Deutsche, Mediabrands and CMG. Leading client sectors were health care, tech and telecom and food and beverage. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 6.4% organically, which is on top of 10.7% a year ago. We had strong growth at all 3 global integrated networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe as well as our digital specialists, Huge and R/GA. Most client sectors grew as well, notably retail, consumer goods and food and beverage. Continental Europe increased 3.5% to 5% organically on top of 3.8% a year ago. We were led by Mediabrands, Lowe and R/GA. Geographically, this result included growth in Spain and moderate decreases in both Germany and France. 
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q1 organic growth was 6% with increases in many national markets led by China, India and Singapore. Lowe and McCann were very strong across the region as were Huge and R/GA. In LatAm, we decreased 0.7% organically on top of 18% growth a year ago as well as 16% growth in Q1 2013. The decrease was driven by increasingly challenged economy in Brazil and the timing of client spending, partially offset by growth in other markets, such as Argentina and Mexico. Our Other Markets group increased 10.4% organically in Q1, driven mainly by growth in the Middle East. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.4%. Moving to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the first quarter, total operating expenses increased 1.2% from a year ago compared to our reported revenue increase of 2.4%. Our Q1 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 72.5% this year compared with 72.6% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. It is important to note that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which is offset dollar-for-dollar at lower O&G expense, results in some deleveraging on SRS and some leveraging of O&G while resulting in no impact on operating profit. Adjusted for the change in pass-through revenue, our SRS leverage is 40 basis points. 
Our base salaries' benefit tax was 60.5% of revenue compared with 60.3% a year ago, an increase of 20 basis points. Expense for temporary labor was 3.9% of revenue, the same level as the year ago. Incentive expense as a percentage of revenue was also unchanged from a year ago and severance expense improved 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. All other salaries and related expense was 3.2% of revenue compared with 3.3% a year ago. Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,000. Headcount increased during the quarter by approximately 1% from Q4 of 2014 on higher growth areas of the portfolio and to support new business wins. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 27% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 100 basis points from a year ago with leverage across most major components. We had 50 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 30 basis points of leverage on telecom, office supplies and travel and 30 basis points on our category of all other O&G expense as pass-through expenses decreased. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.7%, which reflects solid progress towards our full year target of 80 to 100 basis points. Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the first quarter with $741 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level is seasonal and it tends to peak at year end. 
On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $797 million compared with $726 million a year ago. Operating cash flow is also seasonal as our business generates significant cash in working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in working capital in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $801 million compared with the use of $723 million a year ago. Investing activities in Q1 used $20 million for capital expenditures. 
Financing activity used $51 million, mainly in capital return to shareholders, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings. We used $51 million per share repurchases and our common stock dividend was $49 million. Typically, the pace of our share repurchases is geared to our fourth quarter when our cash flows are strongest. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $926 million compared with $866 million a year ago. 
On Slides 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.76 billion at the most recent quarter end. In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Organic revenue performance was not only competitive, it looks to have come in at the top end of our sector. It bears noting that digital services across the group were significant contributors to organic revenue growth. 
Other highlights in terms of organic growth include the fact that we saw contributions from across the portfolio, including all 3 global networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe. Performance at Mediabrands and at our PR agencies continue to be strong. Asia and the U.K. grew well, and we saw positive growth quarter in Continental Europe. The deceleration we experienced in LatAm largely reflects macroeconomic issues in Brazil as well as the fact that we were facing difficult comps in that region. 
We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management. And we remain focused on converting the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions should ensure that we maintained the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders. 
Moving on to the tone of the business. What we are hearing from our operators and in our conversations with major multinational clients is that there is a consistent commitment to investing behind brands as companies seek to drive their business forward. We are seeing areas of macro uncertainties, such as Brazil, Russia and certain markets in the Middle East. Of course, it's still early in the year with only 3 months in the books at this point, but the overall environment is such that we continue to see sufficient opportunities for us to achieve our stated growth objectives for the year. 
The marketing mix that is right for each of our clients in order to meet a range of marketing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. We therefore need to be able to customize our approach for each specific situation as we continue to have at our disposal all of the tools required to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace. Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are tracking solid activity at most of our agencies. The first quarter saw some notable wins, and we're involved in the full range of major opportunities that are currently being contested. Other than those, we are conflicted and unable to participate. 
Our performance in new business were very strong last year, and we want to keep building on that result. Highlights at our agencies include a very strong quarter for McCann with continued new business momentum, increased levels of integration within Worldgroup and in working with a range of IPG agencies as well as a very strong showing in terms of industry honors, including the recent news from the global Effie Awards that McCann has been named the industry's second-ranked network in terms of marketing effectiveness. 
Lowe ranked #4 globally on the Effies index in terms of marketing effectiveness. And one of its campaigns for Unilever was recognized as the best in the world in terms of driving marketplace results. The integration of Profero continues to go well. And that's providing Lowe with a strong digital partner on a range of client engagements. As previously mentioned, our focus with Lowe remains to scale the network more broadly in the U.S. and unlock potential growth in the U.S. base multinationals. 
Progress at FCB continued to be evident in its results, especially domestically and in the U.K., with the merger with Inferno has been a success. The agency's flagship Chicago office won significant assignments during the quarter with In Bev, and more recently, the New York agency was named AOR for Vonage. We see further promise at the FCB health operations, especially as we add the ICC Lowe assets to that portfolio. 
At Mediabrands, the management succession has been quite seamless with Henry Tajer moving from his global COO role to CEO. Initiative and UM are strong and competitive networks. We continue to be a leader in addressing the changes that technology is bringing to the media landscape as evident by Cadreon's recent announcement that it will be the first in programmatic radio. Our investment in Samba TV and MAGNA GLOBAL creation of a consortium of 15 cable networks to enable targeted automated buying of TV inventory. It bears noting here that our overall organic growth results do not benefit from taking inventory positions in media, particularly the programmatic space, where our offering is strong but predicated on a whole consultive of model in which our impartiality and expertise are key differentiators. 
CMG agencies continued to perform well in the quarter, led by public relations. We were consistently winners in market share, new assignments from client, such as Unilever, Mattel, Sealed Air, United Nations, and most recently, the American Cancer Society as well as major awards, including Weber Shandwick once again being named Agency of the Year by PRWeek. Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Coming off outstanding overall performance in 2014, Mullen and Deutsche continued to be leaders in the marketplace. Carmichael Lynch added U.S. Bank after a highly competitive review that just concluded in early April. 
Along with the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday, all of our domestic independents provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged creative, digital, experiential, analytics and social capabilities. Huge, MRM and R/GA are all leaders in the marketplace. MRM is among the leading industry's top global digital networks with 30 offices in over 20 world markets. The growth at Huge has been significant and the agency continues to be known for its best-in-class capabilities in the area of marketing utility. R/GA remains the leader in innovations that have defined digital marketing since its inception. We are also very proud that this year, the Cannes Festival will recognize Bob Greenberg with its most prestigious honor for, and I quote, ""having helped show the way forward for the industry."" 
Some among our peers have approached digital primarily by means of headline-grabbing M&A transactions and a siloed approach to this key competency. 
We continue to see the benefits of our long-term approach on investing in talent and embedding digital expertise and capabilities throughout our portfolio of agencies. We believe this is consistent with the changing dynamics of media usage and consumer behavior. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a client-centric connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance. 
As we look to the balance of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring. And we will, of course, remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. While first quarter results were quite positive, it bears repeating that it is our seasonally smallest quarter and there is still work ahead for us to deliver the year. At this point, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieved our organic growth target of 3% to 4% and to improve operating margin by 80 to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we have been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I thank you for your time and open up the floor to questions."

Look, now that we're investment grade from all 3 rating agencies, what it does give us is additional flexibility on liquidity. It should open up an opportunity for us to utilize commercial paper. That will add to our existing lines of credit that we have, which are almost $1 billion. So clearly, that gives us financial flexibility as we go forward. We can't say when, but we are looking at all opportunities on commercial paper. And as that frees up cash on our balance sheet, that will be factored into our needs for the business in terms of acquisitions. And certainly, dividends and buybacks will be reflective of our balance sheet strength and excess cash we have. So I think it gives us additional cushion, if you will, as we move forward. We still have a significant amount of authorized buyback from our board, a $390-some-odd million. And obviously, at this point, that's sufficient and we will continue to monitor that as we go forward. We're committed to returning cash to our shareholders in both dividend as well as buyback methodologies."

Some 10 years ago, you may recall that we made that as an important issue as we became Sarbanes-compliant. At that point in time, you recall, we set up a significant amount of liability to pay back to our clients. And we embarked on a full transparency program within IPG to make sure that there's transparency and that any rebates will be properly reflected in our contracts and given to our clients. So consistent with that, in those market -- well, first of all, in the U.S., we have no rebates and therefore, it's not an issue for us in the U.S. And in those markets where there are rebates, we're, in fact, encouraged by our clients to get as much volume rebates as possible. And our contracts are clear that those rebates belong to our clients or how they instruct us to treat those rebates. So we are extremely comfortable with the notion that we don't have any issues with respect to that. And in fact, all of our contracts are fully transparent and consistent with that notion that we established 10 years ago. So we're comfortable there. On the issue of Brazil, of course, we're disappointed in what happened in Brazil. I might point out that we, in fact, instigated that review prior to what the news that you saw in the media. And in fact, we had an extensive review of what was going on in Brazil, and we took action internally in the fact that we dismissed 1 or 2 employees within that organization. And based on the reviews that we've seen, this has been an isolated case of those 1 or 2 individuals. We have been cooperating with all the authorities with respect to that. We do not see a systemic issue here with respect to that. This is the action of 1 or 2 individuals. From a financial point of view, the numbers that are involved are not material to both IPG and our revenue numbers and our profitability. And we are following up on this very carefully and cooperating. We do not believe that this is a systemic issue for us in Brazil and we're cooperating as best we can. By the way, part of your question might be that we did see a decline in Brazil in this year. That had nothing to do with this particular issue. This was a -- the decline is twofold: one is we had a very strong comp versus last year well in double digits; and two, the macroeconomic environment in Brazil is difficult at the current time."

We can spend an hour talking about that, David, and we probably will. But it's interesting, I just addressed -- Harris had a global meeting of the McCann Worldgroup that's for 500 people down in Florida. It was great meeting. And I was addressing the very issues that you're talking about. First of all, we don't settle in, okay? This business, as you know, is very difficult. And if you settle in, in anything, you lose. So we are continually focusing on, as you pointed out, keeping the backdoor closed. And if you look at -- as I answered the question before, of our top 20 clients, we had very nice organic revenue growth from those existing clients. And clearly, the fact that we were keeping the backdoor closed is one of those reasons. And we do not take clients for granted. Frankly, the mantra around here is that we treat existing clients as if we're pitching them for new business because that's the way we should treat existing clients. And settling in is hardly a thing to do when we have this large fragmented media environment, very competitive from our clients in terms of prices and so on. And our main mantra is going to be we have to be client-centric. And what that means is we have to continue to focus on the needs of our clients. And in order to do that, we have to invest in talent, we have to invest in all the technology that's out there, we have to provide integrated offerings because clients are looking for one place or places that gives them the edge up on a competitive situation. And clearly, media, digital, talent, creative all come together finally in this business. For years, it's always been siloed. And now if we don't provide an integrated offering, clients will look for it elsewhere. So we are not taking anything for granted. Obviously, we're very pleased with both the last year's results and the first quarter. But we are constantly focusing on how to be better. We don't have to be bigger, but we have to be best-in-class in terms of meeting the needs of our clients. And that is what our operators are focused on. And the results of that, you're seeing in the organic growth that we're having and the margin improvement because we are still focused on narrowing that gap. So I think the key to the future of IPG is not being the biggest, we have to be client-centric, we have to be the place where talent wants to go. One of the things that I really am pleased about is the fact that we've been able to recruit high-caliber talent across all of our networks. And frankly, we like the fact that IPG is viewed as a good place to be within our peer group because of the fact that we are client-centric and we are focused on meeting the needs of the clients directly. Other than that, we don't pay attention to it, David."

We have, historically, been different than our competitor, certainly more recently on the issue of taking inventory. The reason that there's gross versus net with respect to some of our competitors is that they take inventory on their own behalf, and then in essence, sell that inventory to our -- to their clients. We act as, in essence, agents for our clients. We do not take inventory. And as a result, when you see our gross versus net, the only item that affects our gross versus net is our experiential and pass-through type expenses. And by the way, those expenses do not carry margin along with it. So we do not have a gross up in our organic revenue that reflects media-owned. And it is our stated policy. And frankly, we believe that being agnostic in the marketplace is a competitive advantage to us versus our competitors because it's hard to be an adviser when on one hand, you're giving them advice as to where they should place their media dollars, and then on the other hand, you have an inventory component that you have an equity interest in, in getting rid of it at a profit. So we believe that it's a distinction that we will maintain in the marketplace. Now if, as some of our competitors say, it makes no difference as long as the net of buying and effectiveness is there, if we see the marketplace develop over a period of time where, in fact, that is recognized and not giving us an advantage in terms of meeting the needs of our clients, then we will rethink it. But right now, as recently as this month, we looked at that again. And we believe, as you'll see in some of the pitches, that taking that inventory position is not consistent with our overall model as being agnostic in the marketplace. And frankly, if I were a consumer, that's the way I would look at it. So that's our strategy. And the accounting follows your business practice. And therefore, our accounting does not require us to gross anything other than the pass-throughs that we have. As far as CMG, I'll let Frank talk about CMG."

You guys set out a number a year or 2 ago, which I never really took as a realistic but more like a reach figure of doing somewhere toward half of totally buying on a programmatic basis in a few years time. Your acquisition or your partnership with Samba TV seems to be a step in that direction. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about how you're moving toward programmatic buying in online video, and then in more traditional media, like TV and radio."

It may be over a period of time. But what we said 50% was going to be automation. And that's a little bit different than putting everything under the programmatic. I mean, frankly, our media business, we're using cables and faxes. So our main objective was moving towards automation. We do see a significant rise in programmatic, but it is not at the levels of 50%. And we have been rolling that out on a global basis because we think it is a very efficient and effective way to handle video certainly on the digital side of the business. So we are committed to it. Cadreon was one of the leaders in the business. We keep investing in Cadreon in talents and tools. And as you point out, we entered into all these agreements with various cable operators and, in fact, with radio now and our investment in Samba TV, all of these things are related about having the right data to place the media dollars in the right place to reach the right people at an efficient way. And we believe that it should be -- automation should play an important part of it, and programmatic falls within that automation."

Obviously, the Russian markets are not the strongest right now. But recently, I've actually had some direct conversations with our clients because frankly, for years now, we've been talking to our partner in Russia. And in fact, we've got some approval in Russia for us to do a transaction with respect to our partner on some of their properties there, enabling us to have better control of the quality of the product with respect to our multinational clients in Russia. And we're planning on going forward with that transaction. So you might say, ""Gee, in this environment, why are you doing that in Russia?"" And the answer is our clients still believe that Russia is an important market. And consistent with that, it's important for us to have the top talent and resources servicing those clients in Russia. So we're going forward with our transaction with ADV. I have say it's at a cheaper price obviously in terms of both the movement of the currency as well as the economics in Russia, and we took advantage of that. But we are still moving forward and believe Russia is an important market. And frankly, it's a place that we still believed we have to be there to service our multinational clients. Brazil, everyone knows, is going through a difficult time right now. And it was a pullback when we saw up in our multinational, our larger global agencies down there. It was partially offset by other areas in Latin America that were positive, Mexico, for example. But Brazil, we're watching very carefully. We hope to return to growth in Brazil throughout the year. But the benefit of being a multinational and global service provider that we are, where one region becomes a little difficult, fortunately there are other regions that are strong. What I'm particularly pleased to see is the growth in India. We went through a period in India where the growth wasn't there during the elections. And now that Modi is in place and things are happening, we have double-digit growth, almost double-digit growth in India. So I think that's a positive sign. And obviously, China continues to grow for us at a double-digit rate. And of course, we're very strong in the U.S. So we're watching Brazil carefully. We still have top-tier talent and our agencies down there are best-in-class. And as Brazil will get through this, look, the growth of the middle class in Brazil isn't real. And I think eventually with all the events, the Olympics and so on, I think we'll see a snapback in Brazil once this all happens. On our balance sheet, we've always said we wanted to be strong, have a strong balance sheet. Maybe that's part of the DNA of our company, given the difficulties we had many years ago. And yes, there might be a little room in our leverage right now. And frankly, we were that way to make sure that we finally get S&P over the finish line. And we will take a hard look in terms of our leverage and use, as I said, of the commercial paper market, and then maybe some opportunity for us in terms of buybacks. But we make business decision in terms of what we do with our cash. And that cash has decided either it goes to reinvesting in our business, whether it be strategic acquisitions, investments in talent or just overall investment in our businesses, versus returning it to our shareholders. And if we return it to our shareholders, we'll take a look at the mix between dividends and buybacks. And obviously, we're very sensitive to the needs of our investors. And in fact, every investor meeting we have, we ask them what their preference versus dividend versus buybacks. And we'll listen to our investors and we'll respond accordingly. The good news is we will have the financial flexibility to do both. And what that mix is will be decided by the marketplace and the needs of our businesses. And Frank agrees."

I guess, just from a business perspective, as you look across your agencies, are there certain things, which you're seeing that's driving the leverage growth in terms of greater share of wallet from existing clients or just better utilization of a personnel on an individual basis or just hitting more performance incentives across your contracts?

Now you did see the announcement of P&G, for example, they're anticipating cutting agency fees, if you will, by a significant amount. Clients are all -- and it's not new to the industry. Our clients are always looking for more for less. And what we have to be able to do is twofold. One, the most important thing is we have to show that we're adding value to what we're delivering. And therefore, we have to be responsive to the effectiveness -- the creativity and effectiveness of the work that we do. And then we have to be able to measure it and be accountable for it. So I think the pressure is much greater now, given that these tools are out there for measurement to prove the return on investment with respect to marketing dollars. And we're in a position to be able to do that. And clients appropriately are asking to see that return on investment. And at the same time, they're looking to have savings and be able to show that the effectiveness of what they're spending is greater and spending less also gives them a similar response rate. And frankly, that's where we add value. If we can show that if you spend dollars in one place versus another and the one that's cheaper is as effective, if not better, then it's a win-win. We add value. We get paid for the value that we're adding. Clients show effectiveness and market share. And they spend less. And that is going to be a dialogue between us and our clients forever. And as these tools become sharper, as media plays more and more an importance in terms of the integrated offering, we have to have the best talent, tools and resources and scale in order to be able to make that happen. And that's the dialogue that's going on every day with our clients. And frankly, when I was a client, that's what I would do and that's what's happening. And we're being responsive for it. And if you look at our organic growth, that's a good indication that we're able to overcome and be able to have those conversations. As far as pitches, I think the big pitches that are out there are principally media. And every couple of years, every multinational client looks at their media agencies and puts it through a pitch. And a lot of these pitches are focusing on efficiencies, which is exactly what I just said. And so you see Coca-Cola having a media pitch. You have Unilever having a media pitch. These are global clients. L'Oréal is having a media pitch. These are global clients that not necessarily are unhappy with the services that they're getting, but they want to make sure they're optimizing the use of their media dollars in an efficient way and moving the needle. And we're responsive. We have a good track record in those pitches, and we expect to see that continue. On the creative side, we do have a couple of big pitches coming up, particularly contractual pitches. For example, the Army, which is a mandatory review, and the Navy has a mandatory review, both of which we've been successful in retaining. And obviously, we hope to do the same moving forward. And on the other side, there are pitches out there where we -- are what we call opportunities because we aren't in those pitches, we aren't existing client relationships. And this is an opportunity. For example, Chrysler has a digital pitch out there, and we're participating in that one. So yes, the marketplace has -- and by the way, there are a fair amount of pitches out there that aren't public. And those are the ones where we have existing relationships, where we're looking for a larger share of the wallet. So I think that bodes well for us, frankly, in the industry in that there are these opportunities, where we can get to go head-to-head with our competitors and show where we add value. So it's a pretty exciting time."

We'd like to thank you for joining us as we review our results for the quarter. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance, frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by the Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. Organic revenue grew 5.7% in Q1 on top of 6.6% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines and most geographic regions. It's worth noting that in the quarter, acquisitions added 1.1% to growth and currency translation was a 4.4% drag on revenue. Given the further strengthening of the dollar during Q1, currency translation would be a full year headwind of 5.1% at recent exchange rates. It's also important to note that because our revenue and expenses are evenly matched at current exchange rate, we expect currency would be neutral to our percentage operating margin for the year. 
Operating profit was $8 million compared to a loss of $12 million a year ago. As you all know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue while cost are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Our first positive Q1 result in terms of profit in over a decade is, therefore, yet another milestone that points to the continued progress at Interpublic. During the quarter, we achieved leverage on both our principal expense categories, driving break-even earnings per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the same period a year ago. 
Turning to more color on revenue. Our growth reflects both increases with existing clients as well as new business wins. We were led by increases in the health care, food and beverage, tech and telecom and retail sectors. In the U.S., organic growth was 6.1% with outstanding performance across a broad range of agencies and disciplines. International organic growth was also strong at 5.1% with nearly all major regions contributing. We had increases in Asia Pac, the U.K. and the Middle East as well as a welcome return to growth in Continental Europe. LatAm decreased less than 1% on an organic basis. 
Turning to expenses and margin. Total operating expenses increased 1.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.4%. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 120 basis points. Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority. And we were able to execute against that objective again during the quarter. 
Our capital structure also continued to be a source of value creation. Earlier this month, S&P raised our credit rating to investment grade. This is the culmination of an extended process and reflects significant positive development at IPG in recent years. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 major credit rating agencies according us an important recognition of financial strength and fulfilling a long-standing management objective. 
As previously announced in February, our Board approved a 26% increase to our quarterly dividend and authorized an additional 300 million share repurchase program. During Q1, we repurchased 2.5 million shares, using $51 million. Since the inception of a repurchase program in February 2011, we repurchased 124 million shares at an average cost of $12.63 per share. 
We are encouraged that our performance in the quarter continues to reflect the competitiveness of our agencies. The quality of our offerings across the full spectrum of digital services within our advertising, marketing services as well as media agencies was once again a key contributor to our strong results. Our strategic focus remains on delivering outstanding creativity, top-tier digital capabilities embedded across the portfolio and on crafting integrated solutions for our clients. This combination will ensure that we continue to be called upon by clients for higher-value services, thereby, allowing us to grow and win in today's world of dynamic, technology-enabled consumer marketing. Given the strength of our offerings and our first quarter performance, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our financial targets for the full year. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for some additional details on our results. After his remarks, I'll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of the business, to be followed by the Q&A."

Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results.

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Organic growth was 5.7% in the first quarter, 6.1% in the U.S. and 5.1% in our international markets. Q1 operating profit was $8 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an improvement of $20 million compared to last year. Operating margin was 50 basis points compared with negative 70 basis points in Q1 2014. 
Turning to Slide 3. You'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow. Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.68 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.4%. Compared to Q1 2014, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 4.4% while net acquisitions added 1.1%. The resulting organic revenue increase was 5.7%. 
With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. FX change had minimal impact on our change in operating profit and margin in the quarter. It is also worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased slightly compared to Q1 2014, which is offset by a decrease in our O&G expense. 
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 6.7% at our Integrated Agency Network segment with contributions from all major disciplines with notable increases at all 3 of our global networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe. CMG grew 1.6% organically with continued solid growth in our PR businesses. On a net basis, growth at CMG was in the mid-single digits. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic growth of 6.1% was broad-based across a number of our agencies, led by McCann, FCB, Deutsche, Mediabrands and CMG. Leading client sectors were health care, tech and telecom and food and beverage. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 6.4% organically, which is on top of 10.7% a year ago. We had strong growth at all 3 global integrated networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe as well as our digital specialists, Huge and R/GA. Most client sectors grew as well, notably retail, consumer goods and food and beverage. Continental Europe increased 3.5% to 5% organically on top of 3.8% a year ago. We were led by Mediabrands, Lowe and R/GA. Geographically, this result included growth in Spain and moderate decreases in both Germany and France. 
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q1 organic growth was 6% with increases in many national markets led by China, India and Singapore. Lowe and McCann were very strong across the region as were Huge and R/GA. In LatAm, we decreased 0.7% organically on top of 18% growth a year ago as well as 16% growth in Q1 2013. The decrease was driven by increasingly challenged economy in Brazil and the timing of client spending, partially offset by growth in other markets, such as Argentina and Mexico. Our Other Markets group increased 10.4% organically in Q1, driven mainly by growth in the Middle East. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.4%. Moving to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the first quarter, total operating expenses increased 1.2% from a year ago compared to our reported revenue increase of 2.4%. Our Q1 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 72.5% this year compared with 72.6% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. It is important to note that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which is offset dollar-for-dollar at lower O&G expense, results in some deleveraging on SRS and some leveraging of O&G while resulting in no impact on operating profit. Adjusted for the change in pass-through revenue, our SRS leverage is 40 basis points. 
Our base salaries' benefit tax was 60.5% of revenue compared with 60.3% a year ago, an increase of 20 basis points. Expense for temporary labor was 3.9% of revenue, the same level as the year ago. Incentive expense as a percentage of revenue was also unchanged from a year ago and severance expense improved 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. All other salaries and related expense was 3.2% of revenue compared with 3.3% a year ago. Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,000. Headcount increased during the quarter by approximately 1% from Q4 of 2014 on higher growth areas of the portfolio and to support new business wins. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 27% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 100 basis points from a year ago with leverage across most major components. We had 50 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 30 basis points of leverage on telecom, office supplies and travel and 30 basis points on our category of all other O&G expense as pass-through expenses decreased. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.7%, which reflects solid progress towards our full year target of 80 to 100 basis points. Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the first quarter with $741 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level is seasonal and it tends to peak at year end. 
On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $797 million compared with $726 million a year ago. Operating cash flow is also seasonal as our business generates significant cash in working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in working capital in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $801 million compared with the use of $723 million a year ago. Investing activities in Q1 used $20 million for capital expenditures. 
Financing activity used $51 million, mainly in capital return to shareholders, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings. We used $51 million per share repurchases and our common stock dividend was $49 million. Typically, the pace of our share repurchases is geared to our fourth quarter when our cash flows are strongest. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $926 million compared with $866 million a year ago. 
On Slides 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.76 billion at the most recent quarter end. In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Organic revenue performance was not only competitive, it looks to have come in at the top end of our sector. It bears noting that digital services across the group were significant contributors to organic revenue growth. 
Other highlights in terms of organic growth include the fact that we saw contributions from across the portfolio, including all 3 global networks: McCann, FCB and Lowe. Performance at Mediabrands and at our PR agencies continue to be strong. Asia and the U.K. grew well, and we saw positive growth quarter in Continental Europe. The deceleration we experienced in LatAm largely reflects macroeconomic issues in Brazil as well as the fact that we were facing difficult comps in that region. 
We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management. And we remain focused on converting the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions should ensure that we maintained the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders. 
Moving on to the tone of the business. What we are hearing from our operators and in our conversations with major multinational clients is that there is a consistent commitment to investing behind brands as companies seek to drive their business forward. We are seeing areas of macro uncertainties, such as Brazil, Russia and certain markets in the Middle East. Of course, it's still early in the year with only 3 months in the books at this point, but the overall environment is such that we continue to see sufficient opportunities for us to achieve our stated growth objectives for the year. 
The marketing mix that is right for each of our clients in order to meet a range of marketing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. We therefore need to be able to customize our approach for each specific situation as we continue to have at our disposal all of the tools required to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace. Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are tracking solid activity at most of our agencies. The first quarter saw some notable wins, and we're involved in the full range of major opportunities that are currently being contested. Other than those, we are conflicted and unable to participate. 
Our performance in new business were very strong last year, and we want to keep building on that result. Highlights at our agencies include a very strong quarter for McCann with continued new business momentum, increased levels of integration within Worldgroup and in working with a range of IPG agencies as well as a very strong showing in terms of industry honors, including the recent news from the global Effie Awards that McCann has been named the industry's second-ranked network in terms of marketing effectiveness. 
Lowe ranked #4 globally on the Effies index in terms of marketing effectiveness. And one of its campaigns for Unilever was recognized as the best in the world in terms of driving marketplace results. The integration of Profero continues to go well. And that's providing Lowe with a strong digital partner on a range of client engagements. As previously mentioned, our focus with Lowe remains to scale the network more broadly in the U.S. and unlock potential growth in the U.S. base multinationals. 
Progress at FCB continued to be evident in its results, especially domestically and in the U.K., with the merger with Inferno has been a success. The agency's flagship Chicago office won significant assignments during the quarter with InBev, and more recently, the New York agency was named AOR for Vonage. We see further promise at the FCB health operations, especially as we add the ICC Lowe assets to that portfolio. 
At Mediabrands, the management succession has been quite seamless with Henry Tajer moving from his global COO role to CEO. Initiative and UM are strong and competitive networks. We continue to be a leader in addressing the changes that technology is bringing to the media landscape as evident by Cadreon's recent announcement that it will be the first in programmatic radio. Our investment in Samba TV and MAGNA GLOBAL creation of a consortium of 15 cable networks to enable targeted automated buying of TV inventory. It bears noting here that our overall organic growth results do not benefit from taking inventory positions in media, particularly the programmatic space, where our offering is strong but predicated on a whole consultive of model in which our impartiality and expertise are key differentiators. 
CMG agencies continued to perform well in the quarter, led by public relations. We were consistently winners in market share, new assignments from client, such as Unilever, Mattel, Sealed Air, United Nations, and most recently, the American Cancer Society as well as major awards, including Weber Shandwick once again being named Agency of the Year by PRWeek. Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Coming off outstanding overall performance in 2014, Mullen and Deutsche continued to be leaders in the marketplace. Carmichael Lynch added U.S. Bank after a highly competitive review that just concluded in early April. 
Along with the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday, all of our domestic independents provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged creative, digital, experiential, analytics and social capabilities. Huge, MRM and R/GA are all leaders in the marketplace. MRM is among the leading industry's top global digital networks with 30 offices in over 20 world markets. The growth at Huge has been significant and the agency continues to be known for its best-in-class capabilities in the area of marketing utility. R/GA remains the leader in innovations that have defined digital marketing since its inception. We are also very proud that this year, the Cannes Festival will recognize Bob Greenberg with its most prestigious honor for, and I quote, ""having helped show the way forward for the industry."" 
Some among our peers have approached digital primarily by means of headline-grabbing M&A transactions and a siloed approach to this key competency. 
We continue to see the benefits of our long-term approach on investing in talent and embedding digital expertise and capabilities throughout our portfolio of agencies. We believe this is consistent with the changing dynamics of media usage and consumer behavior. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a client-centric connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance. 
As we look to the balance of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring. And we will, of course, remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. While first quarter results were quite positive, it bears repeating that it is our seasonally smallest quarter and there is still work ahead for us to deliver the year. At this point, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieved our organic growth target of 3% to 4% and to improve operating margin by 80 to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we have been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I thank you for your time and open up the floor to questions."

Look, now that we're investment grade from all 3 rating agencies, what it does give us is additional flexibility on liquidity. It should open up an opportunity for us to utilize commercial paper. That will add to our existing lines of credit that we have, which are almost $1 billion. So clearly, that gives us financial flexibility as we go forward. We can't say when, but we are looking at all opportunities on commercial paper. And as that frees up cash on our balance sheet, that will be factored into our needs for the business in terms of acquisitions. And certainly, dividends and buybacks will be reflective of our balance sheet strength and excess cash we have. So I think it gives us additional cushion, if you will, as we move forward. We still have a significant amount of authorized buyback from our board, a $390-some-odd million. And obviously, at this point, that's sufficient and we will continue to monitor that as we go forward. We're committed to returning cash to our shareholders in both dividend as well as buyback methodologies."

Some 10 years ago, you may recall that we made that as an important issue as we became Sarbanes-compliant. At that point in time, you recall, we set up a significant amount of liability to pay back to our clients. And we embarked on a full transparency program within IPG to make sure that there's transparency and that any rebates will be properly reflected in our contracts and given to our clients. So consistent with that, in those market -- well, first of all, in the U.S., we have no rebates and therefore, it's not an issue for us in the U.S. And in those markets where there are rebates, we're, in fact, encouraged by our clients to get as much volume rebates as possible. And our contracts are clear that those rebates belong to our clients or how they instruct us to treat those rebates. So we are extremely comfortable with the notion that we don't have any issues with respect to that. And in fact, all of our contracts are fully transparent and consistent with that notion that we established 10 years ago. So we're comfortable there. On the issue of Brazil, of course, we're disappointed in what happened in Brazil. I might point out that we, in fact, instigated that review prior to what the news that you saw in the media. And in fact, we had an extensive review of what was going on in Brazil, and we took action internally in the fact that we dismissed 1 or 2 employees within that organization. And based on the reviews that we've seen, this has been an isolated case of those 1 or 2 individuals. We have been cooperating with all the authorities with respect to that. We do not see a systemic issue here with respect to that. This is the action of 1 or 2 individuals. From a financial point of view, the numbers that are involved are not material to both IPG and our revenue numbers and our profitability. And we are following up on this very carefully and cooperating. We do not believe that this is a systemic issue for us in Brazil and we're cooperating as best we can. By the way, part of your question might be that we did see a decline in Brazil in this year. That had nothing to do with this particular issue. This was a -- the decline is twofold: one is we had a very strong comp versus last year well in double digits; and two, the macroeconomic environment in Brazil is difficult at the current time."

We can spend an hour talking about that, David, and we probably will. But it's interesting, I just addressed -- Harris had a global meeting of the McCann Worldgroup that's for 500 people down in Florida. It was great meeting. And I was addressing the very issues that you're talking about. First of all, we don't settle in, okay? This business, as you know, is very difficult. And if you settle in, in anything, you lose. So we are continually focusing on, as you pointed out, keeping the backdoor closed. And if you look at -- as I answered the question before, of our top 20 clients, we had very nice organic revenue growth from those existing clients. And clearly, the fact that we were keeping the backdoor closed is one of those reasons. And we do not take clients for granted. Frankly, the mantra around here is that we treat existing clients as if we're pitching them for new business because that's the way we should treat existing clients. And settling in is hardly a thing to do when we have this large fragmented media environment, very competitive from our clients in terms of prices and so on. And our main mantra is going to be we have to be client-centric. And what that means is we have to continue to focus on the needs of our clients. And in order to do that, we have to invest in talent, we have to invest in all the technology that's out there, we have to provide integrated offerings because clients are looking for one place or places that gives them the edge up on a competitive situation. And clearly, media, digital, talent, creative all come together finally in this business. For years, it's always been siloed. And now if we don't provide an integrated offering, clients will look for it elsewhere. So we are not taking anything for granted. Obviously, we're very pleased with both the last year's results and the first quarter. But we are constantly focusing on how to be better. We don't have to be bigger, but we have to be best-in-class in terms of meeting the needs of our clients. And that is what our operators are focused on. And the results of that, you're seeing in the organic growth that we're having and the margin improvement because we are still focused on narrowing that gap. So I think the key to the future of IPG is not being the biggest, we have to be client-centric, we have to be the place where talent wants to go. One of the things that I really am pleased about is the fact that we've been able to recruit high-caliber talent across all of our networks. And frankly, we like the fact that IPG is viewed as a good place to be within our peer group because of the fact that we are client-centric and we are focused on meeting the needs of the clients directly. Other than that, we don't pay attention to it, David."

We have, historically, been different than our competitor, certainly more recently on the issue of taking inventory. The reason that there's gross versus net with respect to some of our competitors is that they take inventory on their own behalf, and then in essence, sell that inventory to our -- to their clients. We act as, in essence, agents for our clients. We do not take inventory. And as a result, when you see our gross versus net, the only item that affects our gross versus net is our experiential and pass-through type expenses. And by the way, those expenses do not carry margin along with it. So we do not have a gross up in our organic revenue that reflects media-owned. And it is our stated policy. And frankly, we believe that being agnostic in the marketplace is a competitive advantage to us versus our competitors because it's hard to be an adviser when on one hand, you're giving them advice as to where they should place their media dollars, and then on the other hand, you have an inventory component that you have an equity interest in, in getting rid of it at a profit. So we believe that is a distinction that we will maintain in the marketplace. Now if, as some of our competitors say, it makes no difference as long as the net of buying and effectiveness is there, if we see the marketplace develop over a period of time where, in fact, that is recognized and not giving us an advantage in terms of meeting the needs of our clients, then we will rethink it. But right now, as recently as this month, we looked at that again. And we believe, as you'll see in some of the pitches, that taking that inventory position is not consistent with our overall model as being agnostic in the marketplace. And frankly, if I were a consumer, that's the way I would look at it. So that's our strategy. And the accounting follows your business practice. And therefore, our accounting does not require us to gross anything other than the pass-throughs that we have. As far as CMG, I'll let Frank talk about CMG."

The overall segment was relatively flat because we had a fairly large project in the U.K. from our experiential business that didn't repeat this year, it happens every 3 years.

But it's not an inventory position, it's acting on behalf of our client with respect to that inventory, which is why we don't gross that up either. So yes, there is a part of our business that does have some -- it's not an equity, but we do take inventory, but it's on behalf of our client for a specific reason. So our barter business is a little bit different than the rest of our business. And in fact, it's a separate and distinct business. So I have to clarify that point."

Obviously, the Russian markets are not the strongest right now. But recently, I've actually had some direct conversations with our clients because frankly, for years now, we've been talking to our partner in Russia. And in fact, we've got some approval in Russia for us to do a transaction with respect to our partner on some of their properties there, enabling us to have better control of the quality of the product with respect to our multinational clients in Russia. And we're planning on going forward with that transaction. So you might say, ""Gee, in this environment, why are you doing that in Russia?"" And the answer is our clients still believe that Russia is an important market. And consistent with that, it's important for us to have the top talent and resources servicing those clients in Russia. So we're going forward with our transaction with ADV. I have say it's at a cheaper price obviously in terms of both the movement of the currency as well as the economics in Russia, and we took advantage of that. But we are still moving forward and believe Russia is an important market. And frankly, it's a place that we still believed we have to be there to service our multinational clients. Brazil, everyone knows, is going through a difficult time right now. And it was a pullback and we saw it in our multinational, our larger global agencies down there. It was partially offset by other areas in Latin America that were positive, Mexico, for example. But Brazil, we're watching very carefully. We hope to return to growth in Brazil throughout the year. But the benefit of being a multinational and global service provider that we are, where one region becomes a little difficult, fortunately there are other regions that are strong. What I'm particularly pleased to see is the growth in India. We went through a period in India where the growth wasn't there during the elections. And now that Modi is in place and things are happening, we have double-digit growth, almost double-digit growth in India. So I think that's a positive sign. And obviously, China continues to grow for us at a double-digit rate. And of course, we're very strong in the U.S. So we're watching Brazil carefully. We still have top-tier talent and our agencies down there are best-in-class. And as Brazil will get through this, look, the growth of the middle class in Brazil isn't real. And I think eventually with all the events, the Olympics and so on, I think we'll see a snapback in Brazil once this all happens. On our balance sheet, we've always said we wanted to be strong, have a strong balance sheet. Maybe that's part of the DNA of our company, given the difficulties we had many years ago. And yes, there might be a little room in our leverage right now. And frankly, we were that way to make sure that we finally get S&P over the finish line. And we will take a hard look in terms of our leverage and use, as I said, of the commercial paper market, and there may be some opportunity for us in terms of buybacks. But we make business decision in terms of what we do with our cash. And that cash has decided either it goes to reinvesting in our business, whether it be strategic acquisitions, investments in talent or just overall investment in our businesses, versus returning it to our shareholders. And if we return it to our shareholders, we'll take a look at the mix between dividends and buybacks. And obviously, we're very sensitive to the needs of our investors. And in fact, every investor meeting we have, we ask them what their preference versus dividend versus buybacks. And we'll listen to our investors and we'll respond accordingly. The good news is we will have the financial flexibility to do both. And what that mix is will be decided by the marketplace and the needs of our businesses. And Frank agrees."

Now you did see the announcement of P&G, for example, they're anticipating cutting agency fees, if you will, by a significant amount. Clients are all -- and it's not new to the industry. Our clients are always looking for more for less. And what we have to be able to do is twofold. One, the most important thing is we have to show that we're adding value to what we're delivering. And therefore, we have to be responsive to the effectiveness -- the creativity and effectiveness of the work that we do. And then we have to be able to measure it and be accountable for it. So I think the pressure is much greater now, given that these tools are out there for measurement to prove the return on investment with respect to marketing dollars. And we're in a position to be able to do that. And clients appropriately are asking to see that return on investment. And at the same time, they're looking to have savings and be able to show that the effectiveness of what they're spending is greater and spending less also gives them a similar response rate. And frankly, that's where we add value. If we can show that if you spend dollars in one place versus another and the one that's cheaper is as effective, if not better, then it's a win-win. We add value. We get paid for the value that we're adding. Clients show effectiveness and market share. And they spend less. And that is going to be a dialogue between us and our clients forever. And as these tools become sharper, as media plays more and more an importance in terms of the integrated offering, we have to have the best talent, tools and resources and scale in order to be able to make that happen. And that's the dialogue that's going on every day with our clients. And frankly, when I was a client, that's what I would do and that's what's happening. And we're being responsive for it. And if you look at our organic growth, that's a good indication that we're able to overcome and be able to have those conversations. As far as pitches, I think the big pitches that are out there are principally media. And every couple of years, every multinational client looks at their media agencies and puts it through a pitch. And a lot of these pitches are focusing on efficiencies, which is exactly what I just said. And so you see Coca-Cola having a media pitch. You have Unilever having a media pitch. These are global clients. L'Oréal is having a media pitch. These are global clients that not necessarily are unhappy with the services that they're getting, but they want to make sure they're optimizing the use of their media dollars in an efficient way and moving the needle. And we're responsive. We have a good track record in those pitches, and we expect to see that continue. On the creative side, we do have a couple of big pitches coming up, particularly contractual pitches. For example, the Army, which is a mandatory review, and the Navy has a mandatory review, both of which we've been successful in retaining. And obviously, we hope to do the same moving forward. And on the other side, there are pitches out there where we -- are what we call opportunities because we aren't in those pitches, we aren't existing client relationships. And this is an opportunity. For example, Chrysler has a digital pitch out there, and we're participating in that one. So yes, the marketplace has -- and by the way, there are a fair amount of pitches out there that aren't public. And those are the ones where we have existing relationships, where we're looking for a larger share of the wallet. So I think that bodes well for us, frankly, in the industry in that there are these opportunities, where we can get to go head-to-head with our competitors and show where we add value. So it's a pretty exciting time."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of business, to be followed by a Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue as well as profit growth. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6.7%. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.7%. Notably, FX had essentially no impact on our percentage margin. 
Total revenue growth was 1.3%. We saw positive contributions to our top line performance by a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities, which are embedded across the portfolio and consistently among the best in the industry, were significant drivers of growth for us again this past quarter. 
Regionally, our largest markets were standouts, as the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. showed very good growth, with health care and tech and telecom the leading client sectors. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $216 million, up 10% from a year ago. 
Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.5%, reflecting leverage on base payroll, benefits and tax and all O&G expenses. 
Diluted EPS was $0.29 a share, an increase of 16% compared to last year's adjusted Q2. 
Moving to the first half of the year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% on top of a strong 5.6% a year ago. For the 6 months, we posted a 21% increase to operating profit and a 45% increase in diluted earnings per share. This performance continues to lead our industry and builds on a record of accomplishments, in which our people can take great pride. 
Turning back to additional color on the quarter. In the U.S, organic growth was 7.7% in Q2, an outstanding result. We had notable growth at most of our agencies, including McCann, RGA Huge, Mediabrands, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Our international organic growth was also very solid at 5.3%, once again, driven by a full range of services. 
By region, we were led by 11.8% growth in Asia Pac, highlighted by continued double-digit increase in India and China. We again saw a strong performance in the U.K. which was up 7.9% organically. 
In Continental Europe, organic growth was 3.6% in the quarter and 3.6% for the 6 months as well. LatAm decreased 1.6% organically in the quarter, chiefly due to challenging macro conditions in Brazil, which we had called out for you during our first quarter call. 
For the first half of the year, our 6.2% organic growth reflected contributions across all major disciplines as well as all regions of the world, with the exception being a small decrease in LatAm. First half operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses. 
As we have said previously, cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be a top priority, and we continue to successfully execute against that objective. 
With respect to share repurchase, during Q2, we used $51 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months, we have utilized approximately $280 million for share repurchases. We had $342 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter. 
Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 25%. In sum, our performance in the quarter and the first half continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in terms of our digital expertise and in many of the world's key advertising and media markets. 
While economic conditions in some areas of the world present macro headwinds and uncertainties, the overall tone of business remains solid, and we are effectively managing expenses. At the midway point of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to exceed our targeted organic growth for 2015. We are, therefore, upping that target from the previous 3% to 4% organic revenue growth to a new range of 4% to 5% for the full year. Consistent with that, we will look to deliver toward the upper end of our full range operating margin target of 80 to 100 basis points improvement over 2014. At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results, a number of which Michael touched upon. 
Organic growth was 6.7% in the second quarter, with the U.S. up 7.7% and international growth of 5.3%. In our first half, organic revenue growth was 6.2%, reflecting 7% U.S. growth and 5.2% international growth. 
Q2 operating profit was $216 million, an increase of 10%. Operating profit grew 20% -- 21% for the first 6 months. 
Q2 margin was 11.5%, an improvement of 90 basis points compared with last year's Q2. There was essentially no impact from FX on percentage operating margin compared to last year. 
Diluted EPS of $0.29 compares to Q2 '14 at $0.23 as reported and $0.25, excluding a charge of $0.02 per share for early redemption of debt in last year's second quarter. Q2 average fully diluted share has decreased 2% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in the detailed slides that follow. 
Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.88 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q2 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was significant at negative 5.7%. While the dollar was strong against almost all currencies, the most significant changes for our revenue mix were Europe, pound sterling, the Brazilian real and Australian dollar. Acquisitions added 30 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%. 
It is worth noting that our organic growth was, actually, higher at 7.5% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events business. As we have pointed out previously, lower pass-through was offset dollar-for-dollar by lower pass-through expense, and therefore, has no impact on profit. 
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 7.7%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB by Deutsche in the U.S., our digital specialists R/GA and Huge and by Mediabrands. IAM's first half organic growth was 7.2%. 
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.3%, but was mid-single digits, excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We had double-digit organic growth at our PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin, which continue to gain market share. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was an outstanding 7.7% with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. We also had strong performance in the U.K. Organic growth was 7.9% with notable growth at McCann, FCB, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Organic growth was 7.1% over the first 6 months. 
Continental Europe increased 3.6% organically in the quarter. We have positive contributions from Weber Shandwick, McCann, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Among our larger national markets, we continue to see very good growth in Spain and had mid-single digits in France, Germany and Italy also had slight increases. While Q2 is our second consecutive quarter of good growth on the continent, which is certainly welcome, our bottoms-up market view and macro conditions, nonetheless, indicate caution for the near term. 
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q2 organic growth was 11.8%. We had double-digit growth in China, India and Singapore, as well as notably strong growth in Australia. Regional performance speaks to the strong positioning across our 3 global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings. 
In LatAm, our organic decrease was 1.6% in the quarter. The decrease was driven by the increasingly challenged economy in Brazil, partially offset by growth in other markets such as Argentina and Mexico. As you can see on this slide, our recorded revenue decreased includes the effect of sharply weaker local currencies relative to U.S. dollar. 
Our other markets group, which made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, decreased slightly in the quarter on an organic basis but is up 3.9% for the 6 months. On Slide 6, we've charted the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.8%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 30 basis points from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 5% -- 5.7% as it was on revenue. 
Underneath that strong margin improvement, the Q2 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.2% this year compared with 63.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by higher accruals for incentives and other performance-based bonuses, partially offset by leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax. The decrease in pass-throughs revenues weighed on the ratio as well, so the effect on our margin is offset in O&G. 
Base salaries, benefits and tax was 53.2% of revenue compared with 53.6% a year ago. Incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue compared to 2.7% a year ago. Our category of all the salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenue compared with 2.3% a year ago. 
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,400, an increase of 4% year-on-year. The increase reflects our acquisitions as well as organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative and PR, as well as our increases in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.3% of Q2 revenue compared with 26.2% a year ago, an improvement of 190 basis points. We had leverage across all of our O&G expense groups, occupancy, professional fees, travel and entertainment and all other O&G. In the quarter, we had a lease buyout credit in occupancy, which was offset by a net increase in reserves for certain contingencies in other O&G. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.9%, that's 120 basis-point improvement from a year ago. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the second quarter with $856 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year end. 
On Slide 10, we turn to the second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $260 million compared with $169 million a year ago. That includes $41 million generated working capital compared with the use of $24 million in Q2 2014. Investing activities used in that $30 million for capital expenditures, financing activities used $109 million chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by higher short-term borrowings. 
Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $114 million compared with $125 million a year ago. 
On Slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.78 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the first half represent very solid achievements and good progress towards our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we are focused on investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused in the appropriate cost of disciplines and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we continue to play for value going forward. With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

We're very pleased with our results of both the second quarter and year-to-date. In terms of organic revenue growth and margin, Q2 showed very good performance, which was once again, ahead of that of our peer group. All of our major units in all regions, other than LatAm, contributed to this outstanding result. It's worth noting that the digital expertise we have embedded throughout the portfolio has been a significant driver of our growth. It's also worth pointing out that unlike others in our space, we have largely grown these digital capabilities organically, and they are key to our strong integrated offerings. We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management, and we will remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement targets to the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions, should ensure that we maintain a very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders. 
Looking forward, the tone of the business remains positive. Clients are committed to investing behind their brand to achieve their business objectives. And the complexity of the marketing landscape represents an opportunity for smart marketers and their agencies. We are capitalizing on this opportunity, as evidenced in our organic growth to date this year. 
While we saw some signs of strengthening in Continental Europe, we remain cautious in light of political and economic uncertainty in the region. Brazil has also seen a meaningful slowdown, and we will continue to monitor the state of the Chinese economy and adjust our businesses there accordingly. 
Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are involved in the full range of opportunities being contested in the marketplace. As you all know, there's a great deal of activity in terms of media reviews. A number of the reviews involve defending existing client business where we are one of multiple incumbents, which means there is both risk and upside for us. We are also pursuing those net new opportunities where we believe we have the most to gain, and we are passing on others due to conflict or in order to appropriately manage our resources. The volume of media business that is in play is a function of client's continual demand for greater efficiencies, as well as cyclical reviews on the part of some clients. It is also a reflection of the fact that technology is impacting communications, planning and media investments decisions. 
Before moving to my usual updates on the agencies, I'll comment on developments at Cannes, which as you all know, is the industry's premier awards competition when it comes to creativity and innovation. Once again, we're pleased to see outstanding performance from across the portfolio. In terms of awards and points one at Cannes, relative to revenue, we continue to be near the top of the industry. Highlights included R/GA being named Agency of the Year, which is a first for a digital agency and a sign of how core digital has become to success in our business. FCB took home a Grand Prix for work done to promote wellness among women in the U.K. and the network had its best-ever performance at Cannes. McCann won 4 gold Lions for its groundbreaking makeup genius work for L'Oreal. This is a smartphone and tablet app we helped the client develop that incorporates realtime facial recognition and augmented reality, and it has been downloaded over 10 million times since its launch last year. 
Other highlights included the Martin Agency, which won the coveted film Grand Prix, with a very creative approach for pre-rolled digital ads for GEICO, as well as GG Lowe Germany, which won 12 alliance with one of the festival's most awarded campaigns. Other agencies honored included Campbell Ewald, Deutsche, Hill Holliday, Initiative, UN and Weber Shandwick. 
In other highlights of Q2 results, we saw a continued strong performance at McCann Worldgroup. The quality of the agency's creative product is high and integration across disciplines remains a focus. I mentioned the caliber of the digital work that McCann is doing for major clients such as L'Oreal, and it's also worth noting that MRM, which is an integral part of Worldgroup, is one of the industry's top digital networks with offices in over 20 world markets. 
Progress at FCB has been steady, with improvements evident in the quality of the creative work, rate of consistency in terms of net new business and the development of strong capabilities in shopper in digital marketing. Not only is the agency raising it's game, but it's also becoming an increasingly attractive destination for talent, as was evident in the recent announcement that Susan will be joining as Chief Creative Officer. 
At CMG, our award-winning public relation agency, keep winning market share and defining the ways in which digital channels can transform this marketing discipline. 
Weber Shandwick and Golin have raised the bar, and their sister CMG agencies from Octagon, the Jack Morton and FutureBrand are also innovating to their respective areas of expertise. 
We've been saying for some time that the creative fire power at Lowe is something that's at a premium today's world of fragmented media and hard-to-engage consumers but that the agency needed scale in the U.S. to tap into opportunities with major multinationals. By combining them with Mullen and and naming Mullen's CEO, Alex Leikikh, to lead the merged entity, we believe we made that possible and put the agency on the growth we need to see from Lowe. Mullen's offerings are highly created as well as digital and accountable, as was evident in their winning the grand for their largely viral campaign on behalf of American Greetings. 
I mentioned the level of new business activity in media earlier, and the team at Mediabrands is fully focused on securing existing relationships and capitalizing on the new client opportunities we are best suited for.  The unit is not only performing well in financial terms, but we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Cadreon, our programmatic platform, and AMP, our proprietary data set and all of our long-standing commitment to media transparency also differentiates us from a number of our competitors. 
Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Mullen's outstanding offerings are now part of Lowe's proposition. Deutsch continues to be a leader in the marketplace with exceptional creative and digital capabilities. Along with the Martin Agency, Hill Holliday, Carmichael Lynch and a number of others, our domestic independence provides clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged digital analytics and social capabilities. 
In terms of digital, R/GA remains the leader in just about every area of innovation that's defining the future of our business. The recent major win with Verizon was a further confirmation of the strength of their offering. And the accolades for Bob and his team from AdAge to Cannes demonstrate the degree to which technology-enabled marketing is at the center of everything we do. 
We're fortunate to have another agency that's tracking along with similar growth path in my hometown of Brooklyn, which is where Huge is based, so they now have offices in 8 other markets and county. I mentioned the global success of MRM earlier, and the integration of Profero into Lowe is going well and has played a part in the growth we're seeing from the Lowe network in a number of international markets. 
One last observation about the importance of digital expertise. I've mentioned previously that some of our peers have approached digital through big headline-grabbing acquisitions, which have often state siloed within those holding companies. Going back quite a few years, we made the strategic decision to grow digital competencies organically within every one of our agencies. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance. 
The benefits of this approach are evident across the Interpublic Group. We built out Cadreon at Mediabrands, and that is one of the strongest tech platforms in this dynamic space. We have invested in top talent at all our brand agencies. Mullen and Deutsche have outstanding digital skill sets across a range of disciplines, and McCann and FCB are in the same growth path. The social media and content creation capabilities at Weber Shandwick are second to none. If those were standalone groups, they would be among the world's largest digital agencies in their respective disciplines. Golin has a strong realtime digital media offering. Recent acquisitions such as Genuine, Prime and Hudson Global will up the digital game of others in our marketing service specialists. And the addition of Profero is adding an important dimension to Lowe's creative strength. 
Turning to the second half of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring,and we will, of course, remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. But our performance for the first 6 months has been strong on both the top and bottom line. 
At this point, we believe that the appropriate organic target to the full 2015 is 4% to 5%. And given our strong growth performance to date, we should aim to deliver in the upper range of our operating margin improvement target of 80 to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we will and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and support and open up the call to questions."

But as we have said on our previous call, we expected tailwinds in the first half of the year.

Plus we had a little bit of headwinds in terms of the some of the client losses. So obviously, the second half of the year we're targeting a little bit pull back on the growth as a result of that impact. Nonetheless, we're still confident in our forecast in the 4% to 5% that we moved it, that's why we moved it in that direction. We always try to do better, but I think that's a realistic number for us to take into account, both the uncertainty that's in -- out there. Let me just comment on the media reviews. Most of these media reviews that are taking place, the impact of that won't be in effect until really 2016. So to answer your other question, we don't expect to see an impact on the media side of the business as a result of these reviews until 2016.

As you know, we have taken a reserve against repositioning Europe to realign the cost with the organic expectations. We never stopped looking for margin improvement in Europe. It's nice to have some organic revenue, but I think we're being very cautious. We don't have built into our planned a recovery in Continental Europe. And along with that, we're managing our cost very carefully. And we hope to see some margin improvement, but Europe continues to be a difficult market for us to expand margins. And we still view it as a very important market for us, so we're continuing to invest in new people and talent in there. And frankly, we've done a few acquisitions there, and we're seeing positive results. But margin improvement is a little bit harder to get in Europe than we're seeing elsewhere in the world."

And over the past couple of years, it is sometimes driven real volatility around 2Q and your outlook. Can you give us a reflection on June, in particular, and what it's telling us about your business and the general environment? Second question is, while you've taken the top line of kind of a step function, the range in operating leverage at margin was pretty narrowed to begin with, right, at 80 to 100 basis points to 20 bps, and you kind of said so it would be the upper end of that range. My question is, without -- there really is like a step function up that matches top line. Have we sort of maxed out on operating leverage conversion in that, you're not getting -- whether or not the top line kind of materially accelerates from here, and this is a pretty good level, do you -- is it possible to start squeezing more operating leverage out incrementally? Or have we kind of hit a reasonable run rate?"

Of course, the board, and obviously, that's why we're more comfortable moving the organic revenue up to 4% to 5% but June doesn't make a year. And so we still have some cautionary issues out there, particularly in terms of Europe and South America. So therefore, we have some level of Conservancy in that number. On margin numbers, we look at it on a full year basis, okay? So when you look at the 6 months and what our conversion ratio in the 6 months, as you know, we look at converted at a 30% ratio. And frankly, for the first -- for this quarter, we didn't quite make 30%, but we're comfortable in our range of 80 to 100 basis points because the rest of the year, we expect to see the impact of the onboarding of talent that we have in the first half of the year and the revenue coming in, in the second half of the year. We never give up trying to expand our margin. And I think it's a 30% continues to be a reasonable objective for us and for you to assume in the conversion as we go forward. And frankly, using the 80 to 100 basis-point margin improvement, that's where we get to the targets that we're driving against, okay? And I think that's a conservative way for us to look at it. We wrestled with the issue of what we do with that margin expectation, and we felt that by at least saying we think we'll be on the high side of that is an indication to you that we believe we have cost under control in terms of managing it. We still have more work to do. And given the levels of revenue that we see, we're comfortable with that, and we'll deal with the future margin expansion as we put this year behind us."

One thing, as you can see, the difference in terms of the announced growth versus net that our competitors are putting out there or soon to put out there in terms of their future releases. Our only issue of gross versus net reflects the pass-throughs that we see in some of our marketing services businesses. So you will not see an inflated organic gross number from us as a result of taking inventory into our ownership in terms of selling it to our clients. So we believe that continues to be a market distinction for us when we're dealing with our clients. Now whether that makes a big difference or not, I think it's still something to be seen in terms of the reviews that are going on. But I can tell you anecdotally and specifically, when we have conversations with our clients about that, all of them indicate that they believe the way we're approaching this is an appropriate way to do at it and please do see the transparency and the positions we are taking. That said, there's no question that some of our competitors are having success going a different way, and that's something we're going to consider, and we always will consider as we move into 2016. And frankly, if the marketplace doesn't put benefited us in terms of taking that position versus our competitors, then it's something we have to look at in terms of our go-to-market strategy. But right now, we believe frankly, one, it's the right thing to do in terms of dealing with an agnostic position with respect to our clients. We are an adviser. And as an adviser, will find it inherently difficult to be in a conflict position when we are advising them where we should place their media dollars. And we believe that is the right go-to-market strategy. Clients, however, feel that as long as they're getting a savings and they're getting a benefit in terms of where their media dollars are being spent, and that doesn't make a difference, then we'll take a look at it. But right now, we believe it's making a difference in the marketplace. I cannot tell you that we won this particular pitch message what your question is because of that because these pitches that are going on right now, I know a lot of ink is being spent in terms of making a point that this issue of transparency and rebates is why these reviews are taking place. But, actually, these reviews are taking place because clients want to make sure that their media dollars are being spent appropriately in terms of efficiently, in the right place and using all the tools and resources that are out there. And they want to make sure that they're getting best-in-class services. And frankly, if I were a client, I'll be asking the same questions. So it's not down to a pure question of taking inventory or not taking inventory, or transparency or not transparency. It's everything being considered at one time. And we're very comfortable with our position, and we lead with that in terms of our go-to-market strategy."

We don't look to do big transactions and we feel that, a, they're difficult to integrate. B, the price you pay for that in terms of using your balance sheet as well as the risk associated with integration make it a difficult thing to do. That said, some of them are successful and some aren't. Our approach has been quite successful. I mean, I use Huge as one example. When we acquired Huge, they have 80 to 100 people, now they have 800 to 1,000 people on a worldwide basis. There aren't many of those transactions, but those are the kind of transactions that we look at. We look at small to medium acquisitions that are in the sweet spot of areas that we need the expertise, whether it be digital, which obviously is what everybody is looking at right now, or geographic area or it's a disciplined. So we've done a number of transactions in our PR business. Obviously, our PR business is very successful, and we're certainly gaining market share against our competitor. So therefore, when we look at opportunities in acquisitions, if we can bolster their go-to-market strategy, that's a good link, and we find transactions that it's appropriate. So don't expect us to announce a huge transaction on the M&A side, but we are looking on a very careful basis to be within the range. We always say we spend between $100 million, $150 million. We can go up above that a little bit, obviously, if the right transaction comes along, but we're very careful in disciplined in terms of our acquisitions."

And then of course, my next slide is that quote was 25 years ago. Look, we have to be on our toes. We have to continue to invest in what works and what clients are looking for. And as long as we can add that value to client, there's no need for them to take it in-house or use other services. I think what we're seeing, actually, now because of the distribution of media outlets right now, most of our clients are looking for solutions because it's very difficult for them on their own to really go through all these different outlets on an integrated basis. So I think the value proposition that we have now is as strong as it's ever been. As long as we have the type, whether it be programmatic buying, whether it be content, whether it be PR, whether it be content creation, all of it and distribution in the global basis. And we are the only place, and I say we as an industry, we are the only place where we can bring all of this together, and hopefully, on in agnostic basis, to advise our clients where to put their money. So I think our value proposition right now is as strong as it's ever been. And yes, clients are going to look to make sure that we're doing it efficiently. And it's no different than when we look at acquisitions, do we choose to go with organically or buy it. So the buy versus rent argument is out there, and it always is an analysis and it's incumbent upon us to show that we have the tools and resources to help our clients. And if we don't, they're either going to do it themselves or use some of the other providers. So do I think it's challenging? Yes. Do I think we've stepped up to the play? Yes. Do I think we have to do more, of course. And that's really what's driving a lot of these media pitches right now. They want to make sure that they're getting the best and so that they could make decisions with respect to how they move their business going forward, and they're looking to us to provide the solution. And if we can't do that, they'll look for other solutions, and that's no different than it's been 25 years ago. And we just have to stay ahead of the curve. And I know our competitors, whether it be that tech companies or consulting companies are trying to have inroads in there, in addition to clients taking it in-house. But I talked about this in Cannes. The creativity part of this is something that I think we can't lose sight of. And that is we do have that secret sauce, as I put it, in terms of bringing that creative aspect all of these different tools and resources. And we're the ones who are going to provide it because this is where the talent wants to be. To work with these clients, whether they be global clients or domestic clients, these creative people are looking to do that, and we provide that. It's very difficult for these tech companies or consulting companies to recruit and retain the talent that we have in the organization. If you just look at McCann and FCB, as well as the rest of our businesses. But whether you look at Rob Reilly or Susan cradle or any of the other creative people we have within our organization, those talented people are looking to our industry to use their talent. It's tough to get those kind of people and keep them engaged the way we do. So I think that the demise of our business is not something that's going to happen. And it's just -- we just have to remain on our toes to make sure that we continue to invest in people, leverage our creativity expertise and make sure we have the tools and resources to help our clients."

We're managing our cash flow, our Treasury Department financial, Frank and his organization, we look at this very carefully. And frankly, if the opportunity is out there for us to put in a commercial paper program and is beneficial to us, we will do that. And that should free up some opportunities for us to look at return to shareholders, whether it be in the form of dividends or buybacks. We still have plenty left in our buyback authorization. We have over $300 million left, and we intend to use that. And so I like the position we're in right now, from a financial position. And as we get stronger on the macroeconomic environment, then we'll look at the appropriate leverage. And I think that's what we've done for years, and that's the way it should be right now. A knee-jerk reaction to put on a large amount of debt to buy back shares, for example, which a number of people would argue, I think is a short-term play versus a long-term play. But we do look at this, and it's incumbent upon us to review those transactions with upward, which we do. And we'll make a call between buybacks, using our leverage and dividend distribution.

And our global networks of McCann, obviously, is in the forefront and doing very well, FCB, Mullen Lowe, these are very powerful networks on a global basis, and we're seeing the results of investments we've made, restructurings that we've done, particularly, for example, Mullen Lowe, we brought a new talent at McCann and FCB. And I think I don't think I know we're seeing the results of that, I think McCann is a perfect example in terms of Harris and his entire team and people that he's been able to bring into McCann, we're seeing results. And so that is a very competitive offering in the marketplace, and that's certainly, along with FCB and Lowe -- Mullen Lowe, excuse me, contributing to the growth that we're seeing. And yes, in a way, we're taking market share. That doesn't mean that our digital offerings we R/GA, the Huge, the Profero, the MRM's, all of these -- we have some siloed digital offerings that frankly double-digit growth so they're helping us a lot. Our marketing services, and Golin are taking market share. I don't think there's any question that we're seeing that. And media is a strong performer for us, and we're very comfortable. We made some personnel changes in media. I think Henry is putting together a great team. He has an extensive experience in media and it's helping us in these pitches that we're involved in now. I'm feeling pretty positive about where we stand in these pitches that are out there. As I said, we're defending clients that we have a long-standing relationship, I'm comfortable with that. And in those situations where we're w in the block, we hope to pick up some additional revenues. So I think it's all of the above, that's why we are performing. And frankly, that's why investors should be looking at us. It's not just one-trick pony, it's not an overweight in one particular area, whether it be media or whatever. And on a global basis, we're well distributed in terms of resources of revenue. So if you put it all together, you end up with an organic growth that we have, and that's what makes a competitive organization. And frankly, that's why we're feeling good about this particular result that we're showing because it's across the board, it's not just one particular network or organization or discipline that's contributing to it."

But look, there's no question that there's a pullback in Brazil. I mean, the huge growth that we've seen across the board is just not there, so we're concerned about it. Of course, we had a particular issue in Brazil that we had to deal with, I'm not going to burry our head to it. And frankly, we'll be able to put that behind us, and we feel we have certainly have that same spend right now. But it's a market that is going through a lot of changes down there, and so we're cautious about it. Fortunately, in LatAm, we seeing strength in Mexico and Argentina, so that's offsetting some of the weakness we're seeing in Brazil. And so for the full year, although we're down in the quarter, we're relatively flat, we hope, for the full year. And I think that's really reflects what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. Of course, coming into next year, we hope to see a pickup in Brazil because we do have events coming there. And hopefully, particularly, with our marketing services businesses, we're going to provide some kick to the organic side of the business. But it's a concern. The other side of it is that it's going to -- is that the major part of our business, and that's one of the benefits of our global footprint."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of business, to be followed by a Q&A.
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue as well as profit growth. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6.7%. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.7%. Notably, FX had essentially no impact on our percentage margin.
Total revenue growth was 1.3%. We saw positive contributions to our top line performance by a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities, which are embedded across the portfolio and consistently among the best in the industry, were significant drivers of growth for us again this past quarter.
Regionally, our largest markets were standouts, as the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. showed very good growth, with health care and tech and telecom the leading client sectors. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $216 million, up 10% from a year ago.
Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.5%, reflecting leverage on base payroll, benefits and tax and all O&G expenses.
Diluted EPS was $0.29 a share, an increase of 16% compared to last year's adjusted Q2.
Moving to the first half of the year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% on top of a strong 5.6% a year ago. For the 6 months, we posted a 21% increase to operating profit and a 45% increase in diluted earnings per share. This performance continues to lead our industry and builds on a record of accomplishments, in which our people can take great pride.
Turning back to additional color on the quarter. In the U.S, organic growth was 7.7% in Q2, an outstanding result. We had notable growth at most of our agencies, including McCann, FCB, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Deutsch, Mullen, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Our international organic growth was also very solid at 5.3%, once again driven by a full range of services.
By region, we were led by 11.8% growth in Asia Pac, highlighted by continued double-digit increase in India and China. We again saw a strong performance in the U.K., which was up 7.9% organically.
In Continental Europe, organic growth was 3.6% in the quarter and 3.6% for the 6 months as well. LatAm decreased 1.6% organically in the quarter, chiefly due to challenging macro conditions in Brazil, which we had called out for you during our first quarter call.
For the first half of the year, our 6.2% organic growth reflected contributions across all major disciplines as well as all regions of the world, with the exception being a small decrease in LatAm. First half operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses.
As we've said previously, cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be a top priority, and we continue to successfully execute against that objective.
With respect to share repurchase, during Q2, we used $51 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months, we have utilized approximately $280 million for share repurchases. We had $342 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter.
Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 25%.
In sum, our performance in the quarter and the first half continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in terms of our digital expertise and in many of the world's key advertising and media markets.
While economic conditions in some areas of the world present macro headwinds and uncertainties, the overall tone of business remains solid, and we are effectively managing expenses. At the midway point of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to exceed our targeted organic growth for 2015. We are therefore upping that target from the previous 3% to 4% organic revenue growth to a new range of 4% to 5% for the full year.
Consistent with that, we will look to deliver toward the upper end of our full range operating margin target of 80 to 100 basis points improvement over 2014.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results, a number of which Michael touched upon.
Organic growth was 6.7% in the second quarter, with the U.S. up 7.7% and international growth of 5.3%. In our first half, organic revenue growth was 6.2%, reflecting 7% U.S. growth and 5.2% international growth.
Q2 operating profit was $216 million, an increase of 10%. Operating profit grew 20% -- 21% for the first 6 months.
Q2 margin was 11.5%, an improvement of 90 basis points compared with last year's Q2. There was essentially no impact from FX on percentage operating margin compared to last year.
Diluted EPS of $0.29 compares to Q2 '14 at $0.23 as reported and $0.25, excluding a charge of $0.02 per share for early redemption of debt in last year's second quarter. Q2 average fully diluted share has decreased 2% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in the detailed slides that follow.
Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.88 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q2 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was significant at negative 5.7%. While the dollar was strong against almost all currencies, the most significant changes for our revenue mix were the euro, pound sterling, the Brazilian real and the Australian dollar. Acquisitions added 30 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%.
It is worth noting that our organic growth was actually higher at 7.5% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events business. As we have pointed out previously, lower pass-through revenue was offset dollar-for-dollar by lower pass-through expense and, therefore, has no impact on profit.
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 7.7%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB; by Deutsche in the U.S.; our digital specialists, R/GA and Huge; and by Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 7.2%.
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.3%, but was mid-single digits, excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We had double-digit organic growth at our PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin, which continue to gain market share.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was an outstanding 7.7%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. We also had strong performance in the U.K. Organic growth was 7.9%, with notable growth at McCann, FCB, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Organic growth was 7.1% over the first 6 months.
Continental Europe increased 3.6% organically in the quarter. We have positive contributions from Weber Shandwick, McCann, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Among our larger national markets, we continue to see very good growth in Spain and had mid-single digits in France. Germany and Italy also had slight increases.
While Q2 is our second consecutive quarter of good growth on the continent, which is certainly welcome, our bottoms-up market view and macro conditions nonetheless indicate caution for the near term.
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q2 organic growth was 11.8%. We had double-digit growth in China, India and Singapore as well as notably strong growth in Australia. Regional performance speaks to the strong positioning across our 3 global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings.
In LatAm, our organic decrease was 1.6% in the quarter. The decrease was driven by the increasingly challenged economy in Brazil, partially offset by growth in other markets, such as Argentina and Mexico. As you can see on this slide, our reported revenue decreased includes the effect of sharply weaker local currencies relative to U.S. dollar.
Our other markets group, which made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, decreased slightly in the quarter on an organic basis, but is up 3.9% for the 6 months. On Slide 6, please chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.8%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 30 basis points from a year ago, compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 5% -- 5.7% as it was on revenue.
Underneath our strong margin improvement, the Q2 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.2% this year, compared with 63.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by higher accruals for incentives and other performance-based bonuses, partially offset by leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax. The decrease in pass-through revenues weighed on the SRS ratio as well, though, the effect on our margin is offset in O&G.
Base salaries, benefits and tax was 53.2% of revenue, compared with 53.6% a year ago. Incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue, compared to 2.7% a year ago. Our category of all other salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenue, compared with 2.3% a year ago.
Total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 48,400, an increase of 4% year-on-year. The increase reflects our acquisitions as well as organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative and PR as well as our increases in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.3% of Q2 revenue, compared with 26.2% a year ago, an improvement of 190 basis points. We had leverage across all of our O&G expense groups: occupancy, professional fees, travel and entertainment and all other O&G. In the quarter, we had a lease buyout credit in occupancy, which was offset by a net increase in reserves for certain contingencies in other O&G.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.9%, that's 120 basis point improvement from a year ago.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the second quarter with $856 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
On Slide 10, we turn to the second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $260 million, compared with $169 million a year ago. That includes $41 million generated from working capital compared with the use of $24 million in Q2 2014. Investing activities used in that $30 million for capital expenditures, financing activities used $109 million chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by higher short-term borrowings.
Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $114 million, compared with $125 million a year ago.
On Slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.78 billion at the most recent quarter-end.
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the first half represent very solid achievements and good progress toward our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we continue to play for value going forward.
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

We're very pleased with our results for both the second quarter and year-to-date. In terms of organic revenue growth and margin process, Q2 showed very good performance, which was once again ahead of that of our peer group. All of our major units in all regions other than LatAm contributed to this outstanding result. It bares noting that the digital expertise we have embedded throughout the portfolio has been a significant driver of our growth. It's also worth pointing out that, unlike others in our space, we have largely grown these digital capabilities organically, and they are key to our strong integrated offerings.
We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management, and we will remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions, should ensure that we maintain the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders.
Looking forward, the tone of the business remains positive. Clients are committed to investing behind their brands to achieve their business objectives. And the complexity of the marketing landscape represents an opportunity for smart marketers and their agencies. We are capitalizing on this opportunity, as evidenced in our organic growth to date this year.
While we saw some signs of strengthening in Continental Europe, we remain cautious in light of political and economic uncertainty in the region. Brazil has also seen a meaningful slowdown, and we will continue to monitor the state of the Chinese economy and adjust our businesses there accordingly.
Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are involved in the full range of opportunities being contested in the marketplace. As you all know, there's a great deal of activity in terms of media reviews. A number of the reviews involve defending existing client business where we are one of multiple incumbents, which means there is both risk and upside for us.
We are also pursuing those net new opportunities where we believe we have the most to gain, and we are passing on others due to conflict or in order to appropriately manage our resources. The volume of media business that is in play is a function of client's continual demand for greater efficiencies as well as cyclical reviews on the part of some clients. It is also a reflection of the fact that technology is impacting communications, planning and media investments decisions.
Before moving to my usual updates on the agencies, I'll comment on developments at Cannes, which, as you all know, is the industry's premier awards competition when it comes to creativity and innovation. Once again, we're pleased to see outstanding performance from across the portfolio. In terms of awards and points one at Cannes, relative to revenue, we continue to be near the top of the industry. Highlights included R/GA being named Agency of the Year, which is a first for a digital agency and a sign of how core digital has become to success in our business. FCB took home a Grand Prix for work done to promote wellness among women in the U.K. and the network had its best-ever performance at Cannes. McCann won 4 Gold Lions for its groundbreaking Makeup Genius work for L'Oréal. This is a smartphone and tablet app we helped the client develop that incorporates realtime facial recognition and augmented reality, and it has been downloaded over 10 million times since it launched last year.
Other highlights included The Martin Agency, which won the coveted Film Grand Prix, with a very creative approach for pre-rolled digital ads for GEICO as well as GGH Lowe Germany, which won 12 Lions with one of the festival's most awarded campaigns. Other agencies honored included Campbell Ewald, Deutsche, Hill Holliday, Initiative, UM and Weber Shandwick.
In other highlights of Q2 results, we saw a continued strong performance at McCann Worldgroup. The quality of the agency's creative product is high, and integration across disciplines remains a focus. I mentioned the caliber of the digital work that McCann is doing for major clients, such as L'Oréal, and it's also worth noting that MRM, which is an integral part of Worldgroup, is one of the industry's top digital networks with offices in over 20 world markets.
Progress at FCB has been steady, with improvements evident in the quality of the creative work, rate of consistency in terms of net new business and the development of strong capabilities in shopper in digital marketing. Not only is the agency raising it's game, but it's also becoming an increasingly attractive destination for talent, as was evident in the recent announcement that Susan Credle will be joining as Chief Creative Officer.
At CMG, our award-winning public relation agencies, keep winning market share and defining the ways in which digital channels can transform this marketing discipline.
Weber Shandwick and Golin have raised the bar, and their sister CMG agencies from Octagon to Jack Morton and FutureBrand are also innovating to their respective areas of expertise.
We've been saying for some time that the creative fire power at Lowe is something that's at a premium today's world of fragmented media and hard-to-engage consumers, but that the agency needed scale in the U.S. to tap into opportunities with major multinationals. By combining them with Mullen and naming Mullen's CEO, Alex Leikikh, to lead the merged entity, we believe we made that possible and put the agency on the growth path we need to see from Lowe. Mullen's offerings are highly creative as well as digital and accountable, as was evident in their winning the Grand Effie for their largely viral campaign on behalf of American Greetings.
I mentioned the level of new business activity in media earlier, and the team at Mediabrands is fully focused on securing existing relationships and capitalizing on the new client opportunities we are best suited for.  The unit is not only performing well in financial terms, but we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Cadreon, our programmatic platform, and AMP, our proprietary data stack. And all our long-standing commitment to media transparency also differentiates us from a number of our competitors.
Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Mullen's outstanding offerings are now part of Lowe's go-to-market proposition. Deutsch continues to be a leader in the marketplace with exceptional creative and digital capabilities. Along with The Martin Agency, Hill Holliday, Carmichael Lynch and a number of others, our domestic independence provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged, digital UX analytics and social capabilities.
In terms of digital, R/GA remains the leader in just about every area of innovation that's defining the future of our business. The recent major win with Verizon was a further confirmation of the strength of their offering. And the accolades for Bob and his team from AdAge to Cannes demonstrate the degree to which technology-enabled marketing is at the center of everything we do.
We're fortunate to have another agency that's tracking along the similar growth path in my hometown of Brooklyn, which is where Huge is based. So they now have offices in 8 other markets and counting. I mentioned the global success of MRM earlier, and the integration of Profero into Lowe is going well and has played a part of the growth we are seeing from the Lowe network in a number of international markets.
One last observation about the importance of digital expertise. I've mentioned previously that some of our peers have approached digital through big headline-grabbing acquisitions, which have often stayed siloed within those holding companies. Going back quite a few years, we made the strategic decision to grow digital competencies organically within every one of our agencies. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance.
The benefits of this approach are evident across the Interpublic Group. We built out Cadreon at Mediabrands, and that is one of the strongest tech platforms in this dynamic space. We have invested in top talent at all our brand agencies. Mullen and Deutsche have outstanding digital skill sets across a range of disciplines, and McCann and FCB are in the same growth path. The social media and content creation capabilities at Weber Shandwick are second to none. If those were standalone groups, they would be among the world's largest digital agencies in their respective disciplines. Golin has a strong realtime digital media offering. Recent acquisitions such as Genuine, Prime and Hudson Global will up the digital game of others in our marketing service specialists. And the addition of Profero is adding an important dimension to Lowe's creative strength.
Turning to the second half of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring, and we will of course remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. But our performance for the first 6 months has been strong on both the top and bottom line.
At this point, we believe that the appropriate organic target to the full 2015 is 4% to 5%. And given our strong growth performance to date, we should aim to deliver in the upper range of our operating margin improvement target of 80 to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we've been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation.

Look, obviously, all of the above. There's a degree of uncertainty in there. But as we had said in our previous call, we expected tailwinds in the first half of the year. And frankly, we see that leveling off in the second half of the year, partially because our comps are a little different in the second half of the year and the onboarding of new clients that we had starts to level off in terms of those comps. Plus we had a little bit of headwinds in terms of some of the client losses. So obviously, the second half of the year, we're targeting a little bit pull back on the growth as a result of that impact. Nonetheless, we're still confident in our forecast in the 4% to 5% that we moved it, that's why we moved it in that direction. We always try to do better, but I think that's a realistic number for us to take into account, both the uncertainty that's in there -- out there. Let me just comment on the media reviews. Most of these media reviews that are taking place, the impact of that won't be in effect until, really, 2016. So to answer your other question, we don't expect to see an impact on the media side of the business as a result of these reviews until 2016. And hopefully, we'll see positive impact as a result of that."

And along with that, we're managing our costs very carefully. And we hope to see some margin improvement, but Europe continues to be a difficult market for us to expand margins. And we still view it as a very important market for us, so we're continuing to invest in new people and talent in there. And frankly, we've done a few acquisitions there, and we're seeing positive results. But margin improvement is a little bit harder to get in Europe than we're seeing elsewhere in the world."

And over the past couple of years, it has sometimes driven real volatility around 2Q and your outlook. Can you give us a reflection on June, in particular, and what it's telling us about your business and the general environment? Second question is, while you've taken the top line up, kind of a step function, the range in operating leverage at margin was pretty narrowed to begin with, right, at 80 to 100 basis points, just 20 bps, and you kind of said so it would be the upper end of that range. My question is, without -- there really isn't like a step function up that matches top line, have we sort of maxed out on operating leverage conversion in that you're not getting -- whether or not the top line kind of materially accelerates from here, and this is a pretty good level, do you -- is it possible to sort of start squeezing more operating leverage out incrementally?

Of course, the board, and obviously, that's why we're more comfortable in moving the organic revenue up to 4% to 5%, but June doesn't make a year. And so we still have some cautionary issues out there, particularly in terms of Europe and South America. So therefore, we have some level of conservancy in those numbers. Our margin numbers, we look at it on a full year basis, okay? So when you look at the 6 months and what our conversion ratio in the 6 months, as you know, we look to convert at a 30% ratio. And frankly, for the first -- for this quarter, we didn't quite make 30%, but we're comfortable in our range of 80 to 100 basis points because, the rest of the year, we expect to see the impact of the onboarding of talent that we have in the first half of the year and the revenue coming in, in the second half of the year. We never give up trying to expand our margin. And I think it's a -- 30% continues to be a reasonable objective for us to -- and for you to assume in the conversion as we go forward. And frankly, using the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement, that's where we get to the targets that we're driving against, okay? And I think that's a conservative way for us to look at it. We wrestled with the issue of what we do with that margin expectation, and we felt that by at least saying we think we'll be on the high side of that is an indication to you that we believe we have costs under control in terms of managing it. We still have more work to do. And given the levels of revenue that we see, we're comfortable with that, and we'll deal with the future margin expansion as we put this year behind us."

One thing is you can see the difference in terms of the announced growth versus net that our competitors are putting out there or soon to put out there in terms of their future releases. Our only issue of gross versus net reflects the pass-throughs that we see in some of our marketing services businesses. So you will not see an inflated organic gross number from us as a result of taking inventory into our ownership, in terms of selling it to our clients. So we believe that continues to be a market distinction for us when we're dealing with our clients. Now whether that makes a big difference or not, I think it's still something to be seen in terms of the reviews that are going on. But I can tell you anecdotally and specifically, when we have conversations with our clients about that, all of them indicate that they believe the way we're approaching this is an appropriate way to deal with it. And they're pleased to see the transparency and the positions we're taking. That said, there's no question that some of our competitors are having success going a different way, and that's something we're going to consider and we always will consider as we move into 2016. And frankly, if the marketplace doesn't put benefit to us in terms of taking that position versus our competitors, then it's something we have to look at in terms of our go-to-market strategy. But right now, we believe, frankly: one, it's the right thing to do in terms of dealing with an agnostic position with respect to our clients. We are an adviser. And as an adviser, will find it inherently difficult to be in a conflict position when we are advising them where they should place their media dollars. And we believe that, that is the right go-to-market strategy. If clients, however, feel that as long as they're getting a savings and they're getting a benefit in terms of where their media dollars are being spent, and that doesn't make a difference, then we'll take a look at it. But right now, we believe it's making a difference in the marketplace. I cannot tell you that we won this particular pitch, which is what your question is, because of that because these pitches that are going on right now, I know a lot of ink is being spent in terms of making a point that this issue of transparency and rebates is why these reviews are taking place. But, actually, these reviews are taking place because clients want to make sure that their media dollars are being spent appropriately in terms of efficiently, in the right place and using all the tools and resources that are out there. And they want to make sure that they're getting best-in-class services. And frankly, if I were a client, I'll be asking the same questions. So it's not down to a pure question of taking inventory or not taking inventory or transparency or not transparency. It's everything being considered at one time. And we're very comfortable with our position, and we lead with that in terms of our go-to-market strategy."

And I kind of referred to it in my remarks. We don't look to do big transactions and we feel that, a, difficult to integrate; b, the price you pay for that in terms of using your balance sheet as well as the risk associated with integration make it a difficult thing to do. That said, some of them are successful and some of them aren't. Our approach has been quite successful. I mean, I use Huge as an example. When we acquired Huge, they had 80 to 100 people. Now they have 800 to 1,000 people on a worldwide basis. There aren't many of those transactions, but those are the kind of transactions that we look at. We look at small to medium acquisitions that are in the sweet spot of areas that we need the expertise, whether it be digital, which obviously is what everybody is looking at right now, or geographic area or it's a discipline. So we've done a number of transactions in our PR business. Obviously, our PR business is very successful, and we're certainly gaining market share against our competitors. So therefore, when we look at opportunities in acquisitions, if we can bolster their go-to-market strategy, that's a good thing, and we find transactions that it's appropriate. So don't expect us to announce a huge transaction on the M&A side, but we are looking, on a very careful basis, to be within the range. We always say we spend between $100 million, $150 million. We can go up above that a little bit, obviously, if the right transaction comes along, but we're very careful and disciplined in terms of our acquisitions."

And then, of course, my next slide is that quote was 25 years ago. Look, we have to be on our toes. We have to continue to invest in what works and what clients are looking for. And as long as we can add that value to a client, there's no need for them to take it in-house or use other services. I think what we're seeing actually now, because of the distribution of media outlets right now, most of our clients are looking for solutions because it's very difficult for them, on their own, to really go through all of these different outlets on an integrated basis. So I think the value proposition that we have now is as strong as it's ever been. As long as we have the type -- whether it be programmatic buying, whether it be content, whether it be PR, whether it be content creation, all of it, and distribution on a global basis. And we are the only place, and I say we as an industry, we are the only place where we can bring all of this together, and hopefully, on in agnostic basis, to advise our clients where to put their money. So I think our value proposition right now is as strong as it's ever been. And yes, our clients are going to look to make sure that we're doing it efficiently. And it's no different than when we look at acquisitions. Do we choose to grow it organically or buy it? So the buy versus rent argument is out there, and it always is an analysis and it's incumbent upon us to show that we have the tools and resources to help our clients. And if we don't, they're either going to do it themselves or use some of the other providers. So do I think it's challenging? Yes. Do I think we've stepped up to the plate? Yes. Do I think we have to do more? Of course. And that's really what's driving a lot of these media pitches right now. They want to make sure that they're getting the best, and so that they could make decisions with respect to how they move their business going forward. And they're looking to us to provide the solution. And if we can't do that, they'll look for other solutions, and that's no different than it's been 25 years ago. And we just have to stay ahead of the curve. And I know our competitors, whether it be the tech companies or consulting companies, are trying to have inroads in there, in addition to clients taking it in-house. But if you -- I talked about this in Cannes. The creativity part of this is something that I think we can't lose sight of. And that is we do have that secret sauce, as I put it, in terms of bringing that creative aspect to all of these different tools and resources. And we're the ones who are going to provide that because this is where the talent wants to be. To work with these clients, whether they be global clients or domestic clients, these creative people are looking to do that, and we provide that. It's very difficult for these tech companies or consulting companies to recruit and retain the talent that we have in the organization. If you just look at McCann and FCB in terms -- as well as the rest of our businesses. But whether you look at a Rob Reilly or Susan Credle or any of the other creative people we have within our organization, those talented people are looking to our industry to use their talent. And it's tough to get those kind of people and keep them engaged the way we do. So I think the demise of our business is not something that's going to happen. And it's just -- we just have to remain on our toes to make sure that we continue to invest in people, leverage our creativity expertise and make sure we have the tools and resources to help our clients."

We want to make sure that we're well positioned for any surprises that may be out there. Frankly, we learned this the hard way 10 years ago, and we've worked very hard, and thank you for acknowledging, to get the investment grade. I guess, on a pure numbers basis, you can look at our leverage and see that we're probably under-levered, okay? And especially with the investment grade, I know the next part of your question is are we going to be putting in a commercial paper program and use some of our excess cash. We're managing our cash flow, our Treasury Department, financial log, Frank and his organization. We'll look at this very carefully. And frankly, if the opportunity is out there for us to put in a commercial paper program and it's beneficial to us, we will do that. And that should free up some opportunity for us to look at return to shareholders, whether it be in the form of dividends or buybacks. We still have plenty left in our buyback authorization. We have over $300 million left, and we intend to use that. And so I like the position we're in right now, from a financial audit position. And as we get stronger on the macroeconomic environment, then we'll look at the appropriate leverage. And I think that's what we've done for years, and that's the way it should be right now. A knee-jerk reaction to put on a large amount of debt to buy back shares, for example, which a number of people would argue, I think is a short-term play versus a long-term play. But we do look at this, and it's incumbent upon us to review those transactions with our board, which we do. And we'll make a call between buybacks, using our leverage and dividend distribution. I mean, that's what we owe to our shareholders, and that's how we view it."

Or are you taking a lot of share? Or do you think that there's something happening in media buying, in particular, that's allowing the agencies to really benefit from the shift to digital spending? You guys tend to not talk about how much of your business is digital, and I understand completely why you do that. But could you give us any sense for just how much that buying business is changing and whether that's helping to drive this continued strong top line we're seeing?"

Frankly, I don't think we get credit for the strength of our digital offerings. So that's why we spent so much time in our comments to show our strength in digital. You're asking me which of my children do I like better. I think what our results show is that we have strong offerings across the board. And our global networks, McCann, obviously, is in the front foot and doing very well. FCB, Mullen Lowe, these are very powerful networks on a global basis, and we're seeing the results of investments we've made, restructurings that we've done, particularly, for example, Mullen Lowe. We brought in new talent at McCann and FCB. And I think -- I don't think, I know we're seeing the results of that. I think McCann is a perfect example in terms of Harris and his entire team and the people that he's been able to bring into McCann, we're seeing results. And so that is a very competitive offering in the marketplace, and that's certainly, along with FCB and Lowe -- Mullen Lowe, excuse me, contributing to the growth that we're seeing. And yes, in a way, we're taking market share. That doesn't mean that our digital offerings, the R/GA, the Huge, the Profero, the MRM's, all of these -- we have some siloed digital offerings that are, frankly, double-digit growth, so they're helping us a lot. Our marketing services, Weber Shandwick and Golin, are taking market share. I don't think there's any question that we're seeing that. And media is a strong performer for us, and we're very comfortable. We made some personnel changes in media. I think Henry is putting together a great team. He has an extensive experience in media, and it's helping us in these pitches that we're involved in now. I'm feeling pretty positive about where we stand in these pitches that are out there. As I said, we're defending clients that we have a long-standing relationship, I'm comfortable with that. And in those situations, where we're new to the block, we hope to pick up some additional revenues. So I think it's all of the above is why we're performing. And frankly, that's why investors should be looking at us. It's not just a one-trick pony, it's not an overweight in one particular area, whether it be media or whatever. And on a global basis, we're well distributed in terms of resources of revenue. So if you put it all together, you'll end up with an organic growth that we have, and that's what makes a competitive organization. And frankly, that's why we're feeling good about this particular result that we're showing because it's across the board, it's not just one particular network or organization or discipline that's contributing to it."

Of course, we had a particular issue in Brazil that we had to deal with, I'm not going to burry our head to it. And frankly, we'll be able to put that behind us, and we feel we have -- we certainly have that same spend right now. But it's a market that is going through a lot of changes down there, and so we're cautious about it. Fortunately, in LatAm, we're seeing strength in Mexico and Argentina, so that's offsetting some of the weakness we're seeing in Brazil. And so for the full year, although we're down in the quarter, we're relatively flat, we hope, for the full year. And I think that really reflects what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. Of course, coming into next year, we hope to see a pickup in Brazil because we do have events coming there. And hopefully, particularly, with our marketing service businesses, we can provide some kick to the organic side of the business. But it's a concern. The other side of it is, of course, it's not a major part of our business, and that's one of the benefits of our global footprint."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of business, to be followed by a Q&A.
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue as well as profit growth. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6.7%. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.7%. Notably, FX had essentially no impact on our percentage margin.
Total revenue growth was 1.3%. We saw positive contributions to our top line performance by a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities, which are embedded across the portfolio and consistently among the best in the industry, were significant drivers of growth for us again this past quarter.
Regionally, our largest markets were standouts, as the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. showed very good growth, with health care and tech and telecom the leading client sectors. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $216 million, up 10% from a year ago.
Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.5%, reflecting leverage on base payroll, benefits and tax and all O&G expenses.
Diluted EPS was $0.29 a share, an increase of 16% compared to last year's adjusted Q2.
Moving to the first half of the year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% on top of a strong 5.6% a year ago. For the 6 months, we posted a 21% increase to operating profit and a 45% increase in diluted earnings per share. This performance continues to lead our industry and builds on a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride.
Turning back to additional color on the quarter. In the U.S, organic growth was 7.7% in Q2, an outstanding result. We had notable growth at most of our agencies, including McCann, FCB, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Deutsch, Mullen, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Our international organic growth was also very solid at 5.3%, once again driven by a full range of services.
By region, we were led by 11.8% growth in Asia Pac, highlighted by continued double-digit increase in India and China. We again saw a strong performance in the U.K., which was up 7.9% organically.
In Continental Europe, organic growth was 3.6% in the quarter and 3.6% for the 6 months as well. LatAm decreased 1.6% organically in the quarter, chiefly due to challenging macro conditions in Brazil, which we had called out for you during our first quarter call.
For the first half of the year, our 6.2% organic growth reflected contributions across all major disciplines as well as all regions of the world, with the exception being a small decrease in LatAm. First half operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses.
As we've said previously, cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be a top priority, and we continue to successfully execute against that objective.
With respect to share repurchase, during Q2, we used $51 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months, we have utilized approximately $280 million for share repurchases. We had $342 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter.
Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 25%.
In sum, our performance in the quarter and the first half continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in terms of our digital expertise and in many of the world's key advertising and media markets.
While economic conditions in some areas of the world present macro headwinds and uncertainties, the overall tone of business remains solid, and we are effectively managing expenses. At the midway point of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to exceed our targeted organic growth for 2015. We are therefore upping that target from the previous 3% to 4% organic revenue growth to a new range of 4% to 5% for the full year.
Consistent with that, we will look to deliver toward the upper end of our full range operating margin target of 80 to 100 basis points improvement over 2014.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results, a number of which Michael touched upon.
Organic growth was 6.7% in the second quarter, with the U.S. up 7.7% and international growth of 5.3%. In our first half, organic revenue growth was 6.2%, reflecting 7% U.S. growth and 5.2% international growth.
Q2 operating profit was $216 million, an increase of 10%. Operating profit grew 20% -- 21% for the first 6 months.
Q2 margin was 11.5%, an improvement of 90 basis points compared with last year's Q2. There was essentially no impact from FX on percentage operating margin compared to last year.
Diluted EPS of $0.29 compares to Q2 '14 at $0.23 as reported and $0.25, excluding a charge of $0.02 per share for early redemption of debt in last year's second quarter. Q2 average fully diluted share has decreased 2% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in the detail slides that follow.
Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.88 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q2 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was significant at negative 5.7%. While the dollar was strong against almost all currencies, the most significant changes for our revenue mix were the euro, pound sterling, the Brazilian real and the Australian dollar. Acquisitions added 30 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%.
It is worth noting that our organic growth was actually higher at 7.5% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events business. As we have pointed out previously, lower pass-through revenue was offset dollar-for-dollar by lower pass-through expense and, therefore, has no impact on profit.
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 7.7%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB; by Deutsche in the U.S.; our digital specialists, R/GA and Huge; and by Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 7.2%.
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.3%, but was mid-single digits, excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We had double-digit organic growth at our PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin, which continue to gain market share.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was an outstanding 7.7%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. We also had strong performance in the U.K. Organic growth was 7.9%, with notable growth at McCann, FCB, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Organic growth was 7.1% over the first 6 months.
Continental Europe increased 3.6% organically in the quarter. We had positive contributions from Weber Shandwick, McCann, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Among our larger national markets, we continue to see very good growth in Spain and had mid-single digits in France. Germany and Italy also had slight increases.
While Q2 is our second consecutive quarter of good growth on the continent, which is certainly welcome, our bottoms-up market view and macro conditions nonetheless indicate caution for the near term.
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q2 organic growth was 11.8%. We had double-digit growth in China, India and Singapore as well as notably strong growth in Australia. Regional performance speaks to the strong positioning across our 3 global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings.
In LatAm, our organic decrease was 1.6% in the quarter. The decrease was driven by the increasingly challenged economy in Brazil, partially offset by growth in other markets, such as Argentina and Mexico. As you can see on this slide, our reported revenue decrease includes the effect of sharply weaker local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Our other markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, decreased slightly in the quarter on an organic basis, but is up 3.9% for the 6 months. On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.8%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 30 basis points from a year ago, compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 5% -- 5.7%, as it was on revenue.
Underneath our strong margin improvement, the Q2 ratio of salaries and related expense to revenue was 64.2% this year, compared with 63.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by higher accruals for incentives and other performance-based bonuses, partially offset by leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax. The decrease in pass-through revenues weighed on the SRS ratio as well, though, the effect on our margin is offset in O&G.
Base salaries, benefits and tax was 53.2% of revenue, compared with 53.6% a year ago. Incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue, compared to 2.7% a year ago. Our category of all other salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenue, compared with 2.3% a year ago.
Total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 48,400, an increase of 4% year-on-year. The increase reflects our acquisitions as well as organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative and PR as well as our increases in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of this slide. O&G expense was 24.3% of Q2 revenue, compared with 26.2% a year ago, an improvement of 190 basis points. We had leverage across all of our O&G expense groups: occupancy, professional fees, travel and entertainment and all other O&G. In the quarter, we had a lease buyout credit in occupancy, which was offset by a net increase in reserves for certain contingencies in other O&G.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.9%, that's 120 basis point improvement from a year ago.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the second quarter with $856 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
On Slide 10, we turn to the second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $260 million, compared with $169 million a year ago. That includes $41 million generated from working capital compared with the use of $24 million in Q2 2014. Investing activities used a net $30 million for capital expenditures, financing activities used $109 million chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by higher short-term borrowings.
Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $114 million, compared with $125 million a year ago.
On Slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.78 billion at the most recent quarter-end.
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the first half represent very solid achievements and good progress toward our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

We're very pleased with our results for both the second quarter and year-to-date. In terms of organic revenue growth and margin process, Q2 showed very good performance, which was once again ahead of that of our peer group. All of our major units in all regions other than LatAm contributed to this outstanding result. It bears noting that the digital expertise we have embedded throughout the portfolio has been a significant driver of our growth. It's also worth pointing out that, unlike others in our space, we have largely grown these digital capabilities organically, and they are key to our strong integrated offerings.
We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management, and we will remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions, should ensure that we maintain the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders.
Looking forward, the tone of the business remains positive. Clients are committed to investing behind their brands to achieve their business objectives. And the complexity of the marketing landscape represents an opportunity for smart marketers and their agencies. We are capitalizing on this opportunity, as evident in our organic growth to date this year.
While we saw some signs of strengthening in Continental Europe, we remain cautious in light of political and economic uncertainty in the region. Brazil has also seen a meaningful slowdown, and we will continue to monitor the state of the Chinese economy and adjust our businesses there accordingly.
Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are involved in the full range of opportunities being contested in the marketplace. As you all know, there's a great deal of activity in terms of media reviews. A number of the reviews involve defending existing client business, where we are one of multiple incumbents, which means there is both risk and upside for us.
We are also pursuing those net new opportunities where we believe we have the most to gain, and we are passing on others due to conflict or in order to appropriately manage our resources. The volume of media business that is in play is a function of clients' continual demand for greater efficiencies as well as cyclical reviews on the part of some clients. It is also a reflection of the fact that technology is impacting communications planning and media investments decisions.
Before moving to my usual updates on the agencies, I'll comment on developments at Cannes, which, as you all know, is the industry's premier awards competition when it comes to creativity and innovation. Once again, we're pleased to see outstanding performance from across the portfolio. In terms of awards and points won at Cannes, relative to revenue, we continue to be near the top of the industry. Highlights included R/GA being named Agency of the Year, which is a first for a digital agency and a sign of how core digital has become to success in our business. FCB took home a Grand Prix for work done to promote wellness among women in the U.K. and the network had its best-ever performance at Cannes. McCann won 4 Gold Lions for its groundbreaking Makeup Genius work for L'Oréal. This is a smartphone and tablet app we helped the client develop that incorporates real-time facial recognition and augmented reality, and it has been downloaded over 10 million times since it launched last year.
Other highlights included The Martin Agency, which won the coveted Film Grand Prix with a very creative approach for pre-rolled digital ads for GEICO as well as GGH Lowe Germany, which won 12 Lions with one of the festival's most awarded campaigns. Other agencies honored included Campbell Ewald, Deutsche, Hill Holliday, Initiative, UM and Weber Shandwick.
In other highlights of Q2 results, we saw a continued strong performance at McCann Worldgroup. The quality of the agency's creative product is high, and integration across disciplines remains a focus. I mentioned the caliber of the digital work that McCann is doing for major clients, such as L'Oréal, and it's also worth noting that MRM, which is an integral part of Worldgroup, is one of the industry's top digital networks, with offices in over 20 world markets.
Progress at FCB has been steady, with improvements evident in the quality of the creative work, rate of consistency in terms of net new business and the development of strong capabilities in shopper and digital marketing. Not only is the agency raising it's game, but it's also becoming an increasingly attractive destination for talent, as was evident in the recent announcement that Susan Credle will be joining as Chief Creative Officer.
At CMG, our award-winning public relation agencies keep winning market share and defining the ways in which digital channels can transform this marketing discipline.
Weber Shandwick and Golin have raised the bar, and their sister CMG agencies from Octagon to Jack Morton and FutureBrand are also innovating to their respective areas of expertise.
We've been saying for some time that the creative firepower at Lowe is something that's at a premium in today's world of fragmented media and hard-to-engage consumers, but that the agency needed scale in the U.S. to tap into opportunities with major multinationals. By combining them with Mullen and naming Mullen's CEO, Alex Leikikh, to lead the merged entity, we believe we made that possible and put the agency on the growth path we need to see from Lowe. Mullen's offerings are highly creative as well as digital and accountable, as was evident in their winning the Grand Effie for their largely viral campaign on behalf of American Greetings.
I mentioned the level of new business activity in media earlier, and the team at Mediabrands is fully focused on securing existing relationships and capitalizing on the new client opportunities we are best suited for. The unit is not only performing well in financial terms, but we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Cadreon, our programmatic platform, and AMP, our proprietary data stack. And all our long-standing commitment to media transparency also differentiates us from a number of our competitors.
Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Mullen's outstanding offerings are now part of Lowe's go-to-market proposition. Deutsch continues to be a leader in the marketplace with exceptional creative and digital capabilities. Along with The Martin Agency, Hill Holliday, Carmichael Lynch and a number of others, our domestic independents provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged digital, UX, analytics and social capabilities.
In terms of digital, R/GA remains the leader in just about every area of innovation that's defining the future of our business. The recent major win with Verizon was a further confirmation of the strength of their offering. And the accolades for Bob and his team from AdAge to Cannes demonstrate the degree to which technology-enabled marketing is at the center of everything we do.
We're fortunate to have another agency that's tracking along a similar growth path in my hometown of Brooklyn, which is where Huge is based, though they now have offices in 8 other markets and counting. I mentioned the global success of MRM earlier, and the integration of Profero into Lowe is going well and has played a part of the growth we are seeing from the Lowe network in a number of international markets.
One last observation about the importance of digital expertise. I've mentioned previously that some of our peers have approached digital through big headline-grabbing acquisitions, which have often stayed siloed within those holding companies. Going back quite a few years, we made the strategic decision to grow digital competencies organically within every one of our agencies. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance.
The benefits of this approach are evident across the Interpublic Group. We built out Cadreon at Mediabrands, and that is one of the strongest tech platforms in this dynamic space. We have invested in top talent at all our brand agencies. Mullen and Deutsche have outstanding digital skill sets across a range of disciplines, and McCann and FCB are on the same growth path. The social media and content creation capabilities at Weber Shandwick are second to none. If those were standalone groups, they would be among the world's largest digital agencies in their respective disciplines. Golin has a strong realtime digital media offering. Recent acquisitions such as Genuine, Prime and Hudson Global will up the digital game of others in our marketing service specialists. And the addition of Profero is adding an important dimension to Lowe's creative strength.
Turning to the second half of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring, and we will of course remain vigilant on costs and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. But our performance for the first 6 months has been strong on both the top and bottom line.
At this point, we believe that the appropriate organic target for the full 2015 is 4% to 5%. And given our strong growth performance to date, we should aim to deliver in the upper range of our operating margin improvement target of 80 to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we've been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and support and open up the call to questions."

Look, obviously, all of the above. There's a degree of conservancy in there. But as we had said in our previous call, we expected tailwinds in the first half of the year. And frankly, we see that leveling off in the second half of the year, partially because our comps are a little different in the second half of the year and the onboarding of new clients that we had starts to level off in terms of those comps. Plus we had a little bit of headwinds in terms of some of the client losses. So obviously, the second half of the year, we're targeting a little bit pull back on the growth as a result of that impact. Nonetheless, we're still confident in our forecast in the 4% to 5% that we moved it, that's why we moved it in that direction. We always try to do better, but I think that's a realistic number for us to take into account both the uncertainty that's in there -- out there. Let me just comment on the media reviews. Most of these media reviews that are taking place, the impact of that won't be in effect until, really, 2016. So to answer your other question, we don't expect to see an impact on the media side of the business as a result of these reviews until 2016. And hopefully, we'll see positive impact as a result of that."

We don't have built into our plan a recovery in Continental Europe. And along with that, we're managing our costs very carefully. And we hope to see some margin improvement, but Europe continues to be a difficult market for us to expand margins. And we still view it as a very important market for us, so we're continuing to invest in new people and talent in there. And frankly, we've done a few acquisitions there, and we're seeing positive results. But margin improvement is a little bit harder to get in Europe than we're seeing elsewhere in the world."

And over the past couple of years, it has sometimes driven real volatility around 2Q and your outlook. Can you give us a reflection on June, in particular, and what it's telling us about your business and the general environment? And second question is, while you've taken the top line up, kind of a step function, the range in operating leverage at margin was pretty narrow to begin with, right, at 80 to 100 basis points it's 20 bps, and you kind of said so it would be at the upper end of that range. My question is, without a -- there really isn't like a step function up that matches top line, have we sort of maxed out on operating leverage conversion in that you're not getting -- whether or not the top line kind of materially accelerates from here, and this is a pretty good level, do you -- is it possible to sort of start squeezing more operating leverage out incrementally?

And so we still have some cautionary issues out there, particularly in terms of Europe and South America. So therefore, we have some level of conservancy in those numbers. Our margin numbers, we look at it on a full year basis, okay? So when you look at the 6 months and what our conversion ratio in the 6 months, as you know, we look to convert at a 30% ratio. And frankly, for the first -- for this quarter, we didn't quite make 30%, but we're comfortable in our range of 80 to 100 basis points because, the rest of the year, we expect to see the impact of the onboarding of talent that we had in the first half of the year and the revenue coming in, in the second half of the year. We never give up trying to expand our margin. And I think it's a -- 30% continues to be a reasonable objective for us to -- and for you to assume in the conversion as we go forward. And frankly, using the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement, that's where we get to the targets that we're driving against, okay? And I think that's a conservative way for us to look at it. We wrestled with the issue of what we do with that margin expectation, and we felt that by at least saying we think we'll be on the high side of that is an indication to you that we believe we have costs under control in terms of managing it. We still have more work to do. And given the levels of revenue that we see, we're comfortable with that, and we'll deal with future margin expansion as we put this year behind us."

One thing is you can see the difference in terms of the announced gross versus net that our competitors are putting out there, or soon to put out there in terms of their future releases. Our only issue of gross versus net reflects the pass-throughs that we see in some of our marketing services businesses. So you will not see an inflated organic growth number from us as a result of taking inventory into our ownership, in terms of selling it to our clients. So we believe that continues to be a market distinction for us when we're dealing with our clients. Now whether that makes a big difference or not, I think it's still something to be seen in terms of the reviews that are going on. But I can tell you anecdotally and specifically, when we have conversations with our clients about that, all of them indicate that they believe the way we're approaching this is an appropriate way to deal with it. And they're pleased to see the transparency and the positions we're taking. That said, there's no question that some of our competitors are having success going a different way, and that's something we're going to consider and we always will consider as we move into 2016. And frankly, if the marketplace doesn't put a benefit to us in terms of taking that position versus our competitors, then it's something we have to look at in terms of our go-to-market strategy. But right now, we believe, frankly: one, it's the right thing to do in terms of dealing with an agnostic position with respect to our clients. We are an adviser. And as an adviser, will find it inherently difficult to be in a conflict position when we are advising them on where they should place their media dollars. And we believe that, that is the right go-to-market strategy. If clients, however, feel that as long as they're getting a savings and they're getting a benefit in terms of where their media dollars are being spent, and that doesn't make a difference, then we'll take a look at it. But right now, we believe it's making a difference in the marketplace. I cannot tell you that we won this particular pitch, which is what your question is, because of that because these pitches that are going on right now, I know a lot of ink is being spent in terms of making a point that this issue of transparency and rebates is why these reviews are taking place. But, actually, these reviews are taking place because clients want to make sure that their media dollars are being spent appropriately in terms of efficiently, in the right place and using all the tools and resources that are out there. And they want to make sure that they're getting best-in-class services. And frankly, if I were a client, I'd be asking the same questions. So it's not down to a pure question of taking inventory or not taking inventory or transparency or not transparency. It's everything being considered at one time. And we're very comfortable with our position, and we lead with that in terms of our go-to-market strategy."

We don't look to do big transactions and we feel that they're a, difficult to integrate; b, the price that you pay for that in terms of using your balance sheet as well as the risk associated with integration make it a difficult thing to do. That said, some of them are successful and some of them aren't. Our approach has been quite successful. I mean, I used Huge as an example. When we acquired Huge, they had 80 to 100 people. Now they have 800 to 1,000 people on a worldwide basis. There aren't many of those transactions, but those are the kind of transactions that we look at. We look at small to medium acquisitions that are in the sweet spot of the areas that we need the expertise, whether it be digital, which obviously is what everybody is looking at right now, or a geographic area or it's a discipline. So we've done a number of transactions in our PR business. Obviously, our PR business is very successful, and we're certainly gaining market share against our competitors. So therefore, when we look at opportunities in acquisitions, if we can bolster their go-to-market strategy, that's a good thing, and we find transactions that it's appropriate in. So don't expect us to announce a huge transaction on the M&A side, but we are looking, on a very careful basis, to be within the range. We always say we spend between $100 million, $150 million. We can go up above that a little bit, obviously, if the right transaction comes along, but we're very careful and disciplined in terms of our acquisitions."

And as long as we can add that value to clients, there's no need for them to take it in-house or use other services. I think what we're seeing actually now, because of the distribution of media outlets right now, most of our clients are looking for solutions because it's very difficult for them, on their own, to really go through all of these different outlets on an integrated basis. So I think the value proposition that we have now is as strong as it's ever been. And as long as we have the type of -- whether it be programmatic buying, whether it be content, whether it be PR, whether it be content creation, all of it, and distribution on a global basis. And we are the only place, and I say we as an industry, we are the only place where we can bring all of this together, and hopefully, on an agnostic basis, to advise our clients where to put their money. So I think our value proposition right now is as strong as it's ever been. And yes, our clients are going to look to make sure that we're doing it efficiently. And it's no different than when we look at acquisitions. Do we choose to grow it organically or buy it? So the buy versus rent argument is out there, and it always is an analysis and it's incumbent upon us to show that we have the tools and resources to help our clients. And if we don't, they're either going to do it themselves or use some of the other providers. So do I think it's challenging? Yes. Do I think we've stepped up to the plate? Yes. Do I think we have to do more? Of course. And that's really what's driving a lot of these media pitches right now. They want to make sure that they're getting the best, and so that they could make decisions with respect to how they move their business going forward. And they're looking to us to provide a solution. And if we can't do that, they'll look for other solutions, and that's no different than it's been 25 years ago. And we just have to stay ahead of the curve. And I know our competitors, whether it be the tech companies or consulting companies, are trying to have inroads in there, in addition to clients taking it in-house, but if you -- I talked about this in Cannes. The creativity part of this is something that I think we tend to lose sight of. And that is we do have that secret sauce, as I put it, in terms of bringing that creative aspect to all of these different tools and resources. And we're the ones who are going to provide that because this is where the talent wants to be. To work with these clients, whether they be global clients or domestic clients, these creative people are looking to do that, and we provide that. It's very difficult for these tech companies or consulting companies to recruit and retain the talent that we have in the organization. If you just look at McCann and FCB in terms -- as well as the rest of our businesses. But whether you look at a Rob Reilly or a Susan Credle or any of the other creative people we have within our organizations, those talented people are looking to our industry to use their talent. And it's tough to get those kind of people and keep them engaged the way we do. So I think the demise of our business is not something that's going to happen. And it's just -- we just have to remain on our toes to make sure that we continue to invest in people, leverage our creativity expertise and make sure we have the tools and resources to help our clients."

I guess, on a pure numbers basis, you can look at our leverage and see that we're probably under-levered, okay? And especially with the investment grade, I know the next part of your question is are we going to be putting in a commercial paper program and use some of our excess cash. We're managing our cash flow, our treasury department, financial log, Frank and his organization. We look at this very carefully. And frankly, if the opportunity is out there for us to put in a commercial paper program and it's beneficial to us, we will do that. And that should free up some opportunity for us to look at return to shareholders, whether it be in the form of dividends or buybacks. We still have plenty left in our buyback authorization. We have over $300 million left, and we intend to use that. And so I like the position we're in right now, from a financial audit position. And as we get stronger on the macroeconomic environment, then we'll look at the appropriate leverage. And I think that's what we've done for years, and that's the way it should be right now. A knee-jerk reaction to put on a large amount of debt to buy back shares, for example, which a number of people would argue, I think is a short-term play versus a long-term play. But we do look at this, and it's incumbent upon us to review those transactions with our Board, which we do. And we'll make a call between buybacks, using our leverage and dividend distribution. I mean, that's what we owe to our shareholders, and that's how we view it."

Frankly, I don't think we get credit for the strength of our digital offerings. So that's why we spent so much time in our comments to show our strength in digital. You're asking me which of my children do I like better. I think what our results show is that we have strong offerings across the board. And our global networks, McCann, obviously, is on the front foot and doing very well. FCB, Mullen Lowe, these are very powerful networks on a global basis, and we're seeing the results of investments we've made, restructurings that we've done, particularly, for example, Mullen Lowe. We brought in new talent at McCann and FCB. And I think -- I don't think, I know we're seeing the results of that. I think McCann is a perfect example in terms of Harris and his entire team and the people that he's been able to bring into McCann, we're seeing results. And so that is a very competitive offering in the marketplace, and that's certainly, along with FCB and Lowe -- Mullen Lowe, excuse me, contributing to the growth that we're seeing. And yes, in a way, we're taking market share. That doesn't mean that our digital offerings, the R/GAs, the Huge, the Profero, the MRMs, all these -- we have some siloed digital offerings that are, frankly, double-digit growth, so they're helping us a lot. Our marketing services, Weber Shandwick and Golin, are taking market share. I don't think there's any question that we're seeing that. And media is a strong performer for us, and we're very comfortable. We made some personnel changes in media. I think Henry is putting together a great team. He has extensive experience in media, and it's helping us in these pitches that we're involved in now. I'm feeling pretty positive about where we stand in these pitches that are out there. As I said, we're defending clients that we have a long-standing relationship, I'm comfortable with that. And in those situations where we're new to the block, we hope to pick up some additional revenue. So I think it's all of the above is why we're performing. And frankly, that's why investors should be looking at us. It's not just a one-trick pony, it's not an overweight in one particular area, whether it be media or whatever. And on a global basis, we're well distributed in terms of our sources of revenue. So if you put it all together, you end up with an organic growth that we have, and that's what makes a competitive organization. And frankly, that's why we're feeling good about this particular result that we're showing because it's across the board, it's not just one particular network or organization or discipline that's contributing to it."

And frankly, we'll be able to put that behind us, and we feel we have -- we certainly have that fenced in right now. But it's a market that is going through a lot of changes down there, and so we're cautious about it. Fortunately, in LatAm, we're seeing strength in Mexico and Argentina, so that's offsetting some of the weakness we're seeing in Brazil. And so for the full year, although we're down in the quarter, we're relatively flat, we hope, for the full year. And I think that really reflects what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. Of course, coming into next year, we hope to see a pickup in Brazil because we do have events coming there. And hopefully, particularly, with our marketing service businesses, we can provide some kick to the organic side of the business. But it's a concern.

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of business, to be followed by a Q&A.
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue as well as profit growth. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6.7%. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.7%. Notably, FX had essentially no impact on our percentage margin.
Total revenue growth was 1.3%. We saw positive contributions to our top line performance by a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities, which are embedded across the portfolio and consistently among the best in the industry, were significant drivers of growth for us again this past quarter.
Regionally, our largest markets were standouts, as the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. showed very good growth, with health care and tech and telecom the leading client sectors. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $216 million, up 10% from a year ago.
Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.5%, reflecting leverage on base payroll, benefits and tax and all O&G expenses.
Diluted EPS was $0.29 a share, an increase of 16% compared to last year's adjusted Q2.
Moving to the first half of the year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% on top of a strong 5.6% a year ago. For the 6 months, we posted a 21% increase to operating profit and a 45% increase in diluted earnings per share. This performance continues to lead our industry and builds on a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride.
Turning back to additional color on the quarter. In the U.S, organic growth was 7.7% in Q2, an outstanding result. We had notable growth at most of our agencies, including McCann, FCB, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Deutsch, Mullen, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Our international organic growth was also very solid at 5.3%, once again driven by a full range of services.
By region, we were led by 11.8% growth in Asia Pac, highlighted by continued double-digit increase in India and China. We again saw a strong performance in the U.K., which was up 7.9% organically.
In Continental Europe, organic growth was 3.6% in the quarter and 3.6% for the 6 months as well. LatAm decreased 1.6% organically in the quarter, chiefly due to challenging macro conditions in Brazil, which we had called out for you during our first quarter call.
For the first half of the year, our 6.2% organic growth reflected contributions across all major disciplines as well as all regions of the world, with the exception being a small decrease in LatAm. First half operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses.
As we've said previously, cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be a top priority, and we continue to successfully execute against that objective.
With respect to share repurchase, during Q2, we used $51 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months, we have utilized approximately $280 million for share repurchases. We had $342 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter.
Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 25%.
In sum, our performance in the quarter and the first half continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in terms of our digital expertise and in many of the world's key advertising and media markets.
While economic conditions in some areas of the world present macro headwinds and uncertainties, the overall tone of business remains solid, and we are effectively managing expenses. At the midway point of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to exceed our targeted organic growth for 2015. We are therefore upping that target from the previous 3% to 4% organic revenue growth to a new range of 4% to 5% for the full year.
Consistent with that, we will look to deliver toward the upper end of our full range operating margin target of 80 to 100 basis points improvement over 2014.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results, a number of which Michael touched upon.
Organic growth was 6.7% in the second quarter, with the U.S. up 7.7% and international growth of 5.3%. In our first half, organic revenue growth was 6.2%, reflecting 7% U.S. growth and 5.2% international growth.
Q2 operating profit was $216 million, an increase of 10%. Operating profit grew 20% -- 21% for the first 6 months.
Q2 margin was 11.5%, an improvement of 90 basis points compared with last year's Q2. There was essentially no impact from FX on percentage operating margin compared to last year.
Diluted EPS of $0.29 compares to Q2 '14 at $0.23 as reported and $0.25, excluding a charge of $0.02 per share for early redemption of debt in last year's second quarter. Q2 average fully diluted share has decreased 2% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in the detail slides that follow.
Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.88 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q2 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was significant at negative 5.7%. While the dollar was strong against almost all currencies, the most significant changes for our revenue mix were the euro, pound sterling, the Brazilian real and the Australian dollar. Acquisitions added 30 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%.
It is worth noting that our organic growth was actually higher at 7.5% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events business. As we have pointed out previously, lower pass-through revenue was offset dollar-for-dollar by lower pass-through expense and, therefore, has no impact on profit.
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 7.7%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB; by Deutsche in the U.S.; our digital specialists, R/GA and Huge; and by Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 7.2%.
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.3%, but was mid-single digits, excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We had double-digit organic growth at our PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin, which continue to gain market share.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was an outstanding 7.7%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. We also had strong performance in the U.K. Organic growth was 7.9%, with notable growth at McCann, FCB, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Organic growth was 7.1% over the first 6 months.
Continental Europe increased 3.6% organically in the quarter. We had positive contributions from Weber Shandwick, McCann, Mullen Lowe and R/GA. Among our larger national markets, we continue to see very good growth in Spain and had mid-single digits in France. Germany and Italy also had slight increases.
While Q2 is our second consecutive quarter of good growth on the continent, which is certainly welcome, our bottoms-up market view and macro conditions nonetheless indicate caution for the near term.
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q2 organic growth was 11.8%. We had double-digit growth in China, India and Singapore as well as notably strong growth in Australia. Regional performance speaks to the strong positioning across our 3 global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings.
In LatAm, our organic decrease was 1.6% in the quarter. The decrease was driven by the increasingly challenged economy in Brazil, partially offset by growth in other markets, such as Argentina and Mexico. As you can see on this slide, our reported revenue decrease includes the effect of sharply weaker local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Our other markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, decreased slightly in the quarter on an organic basis, but is up 3.9% for the 6 months. On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.8%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 30 basis points from a year ago, compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 5% -- 5.7%, as it was on revenue.
Underneath our strong margin improvement, the Q2 ratio of salaries and related expense to revenue was 64.2% this year, compared with 63.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by higher accruals for incentives and other performance-based bonuses, partially offset by leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax. The decrease in pass-through revenues weighed on the SRS ratio as well, though, the effect on our margin is offset in O&G.
Base salaries, benefits and tax was 53.2% of revenue, compared with 53.6% a year ago. Incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue, compared to 2.7% a year ago. Our category of all other salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenue, compared with 2.3% a year ago.
Total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 48,400, an increase of 4% year-on-year. The increase reflects our acquisitions as well as organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative and PR as well as our increases in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of this slide. O&G expense was 24.3% of Q2 revenue, compared with 26.2% a year ago, an improvement of 190 basis points. We had leverage across all of our O&G expense groups: occupancy, professional fees, travel and entertainment and all other O&G. In the quarter, we had a lease buyout credit in occupancy, which was offset by a net increase in reserves for certain contingencies in other O&G.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.9%, that's 120 basis point improvement from a year ago.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the second quarter with $856 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
On Slide 10, we turn to the second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $260 million, compared with $169 million a year ago. That includes $41 million generated from working capital compared with the use of $24 million in Q2 2014. Investing activities used a net $30 million for capital expenditures, financing activities used $109 million chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by higher short-term borrowings.
Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $114 million, compared with $125 million a year ago.
On Slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.78 billion at the most recent quarter-end.
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the first half represent very solid achievements and good progress toward our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

We're very pleased with our results for both the second quarter and year-to-date. In terms of organic revenue growth and margin process, Q2 showed very good performance, which was once again ahead of that of our peer group. All of our major units in all regions other than LatAm contributed to this outstanding result. It bears noting that the digital expertise we have embedded throughout the portfolio has been a significant driver of our growth. It's also worth pointing out that, unlike others in our space, we have largely grown these digital capabilities organically, and they are key to our strong integrated offerings.
We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management, and we will remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investments in talent, supplemented by strategic acquisitions, should ensure that we maintain the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders.
Looking forward, the tone of the business remains positive. Clients are committed to investing behind their brands to achieve their business objectives. And the complexity of the marketing landscape represents an opportunity for smart marketers and their agencies. We are capitalizing on this opportunity, as evident in our organic growth to date this year.
While we saw some signs of strengthening in Continental Europe, we remain cautious in light of political and economic uncertainty in the region. Brazil has also seen a meaningful slowdown, and we will continue to monitor the state of the Chinese economy and adjust our businesses there accordingly.
Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are involved in the full range of opportunities being contested in the marketplace. As you all know, there's a great deal of activity in terms of media reviews. A number of the reviews involve defending existing client business, where we are one of multiple incumbents, which means there is both risk and upside for us.
We are also pursuing those net new opportunities where we believe we have the most to gain, and we are passing on others due to conflict or in order to appropriately manage our resources. The volume of media business that is in play is a function of clients' continual demand for greater efficiencies as well as cyclical reviews on the part of some clients. It is also a reflection of the fact that technology is impacting communications planning and media investments decisions.
Before moving to my usual updates on the agencies, I'll comment on developments at Cannes, which, as you all know, is the industry's premier awards competition when it comes to creativity and innovation. Once again, we're pleased to see outstanding performance from across the portfolio. In terms of awards and points won at Cannes, relative to revenue, we continue to be near the top of the industry. Highlights included R/GA being named Agency of the Year, which is a first for a digital agency and a sign of how core digital has become to success in our business. FCB took home a Grand Prix for work done to promote wellness among women in the U.K. and the network had its best-ever performance at Cannes. McCann won 4 Gold Lions for its groundbreaking Makeup Genius work for L'Oréal. This is a smartphone and tablet app we helped the client develop that incorporates real-time facial recognition and augmented reality, and it has been downloaded over 10 million times since it launched last year.
Other highlights included The Martin Agency, which won the coveted Film Grand Prix with a very creative approach for pre-rolled digital ads for GEICO as well as GGH Lowe Germany, which won 12 Lions with one of the festival's most awarded campaigns. Other agencies honored included Campbell Ewald, Deutsche, Hill Holliday, Initiative, UM and Weber Shandwick.
In other highlights of Q2 results, we saw a continued strong performance at McCann Worldgroup. The quality of the agency's creative product is high, and integration across disciplines remains a focus. I mentioned the caliber of the digital work that McCann is doing for major clients, such as L'Oréal, and it's also worth noting that MRM, which is an integral part of Worldgroup, is one of the industry's top digital networks, with offices in over 20 world markets.
Progress at FCB has been steady, with improvements evident in the quality of the creative work, rate of consistency in terms of net new business and the development of strong capabilities in shopper and digital marketing. Not only is the agency raising its game, but it's also becoming an increasingly attractive destination for talent, as was evident in the recent announcement that Susan Credle will be joining as Chief Creative Officer.
At CMG, our award-winning public relation agencies keep winning market share and defining the ways in which digital channels can transform this marketing discipline.
Weber Shandwick and Golin have raised the bar, and their sister CMG agencies from Octagon to Jack Morton and FutureBrand are also innovating to their respective areas of expertise.
We've been saying for some time that the creative firepower at Lowe is something that's at a premium in today's world of fragmented media and hard-to-engage consumers, but that the agency needed scale in the U.S. to tap into opportunities with major multinationals. By combining them with Mullen and naming Mullen's CEO, Alex Leikikh, to lead the merged entity, we believe we made that possible and put the agency on the growth path we need to see from Lowe. Mullen's offerings are highly creative as well as digital and accountable, as was evident in their winning the Grand Effie for their largely viral campaign on behalf of American Greetings.
I mentioned the level of new business activity in media earlier, and the team at Mediabrands is fully focused on securing existing relationships and capitalizing on the new client opportunities we are best suited for. The unit is not only performing well in financial terms, but we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Cadreon, our programmatic platform, and AMP, our proprietary data stack. And all our long-standing commitment to media transparency also differentiates us from a number of our competitors.
Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Mullen's outstanding offerings are now part of Lowe's go-to-market proposition. Deutsch continues to be a leader in the marketplace with exceptional creative and digital capabilities. Along with The Martin Agency, Hill Holliday, Carmichael Lynch and a number of others, our domestic independents provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged digital, UX, analytics and social capabilities.
In terms of digital, R/GA remains the leader in just about every area of innovation that's defining the future of our business. The recent major win with Verizon was a further confirmation of the strength of their offering. And the accolades for Bob and his team from AdAge to Cannes demonstrate the degree to which technology-enabled marketing is at the center of everything we do.
We're fortunate to have another agency that's tracking along a similar growth path in my hometown of Brooklyn, which is where Huge is based, though they now have offices in 8 other markets and counting. I mentioned the global success of MRM earlier, and the integration of Profero into Lowe is going well and has played a part of the growth we are seeing from the Lowe network in a number of international markets.
One last observation about the importance of digital expertise. I've mentioned previously that some of our peers have approached digital through big headline-grabbing acquisitions, which have often stayed siloed within those holding companies. Going back quite a few years, we made the strategic decision to grow digital competencies organically within every one of our agencies. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance.
The benefits of this approach are evident across the Interpublic Group. We built out Cadreon at Mediabrands, and that is one of the strongest tech platforms in this dynamic space. We have invested in top talent at all our brand agencies. Mullen and Deutsche have outstanding digital skill sets across a range of disciplines, and McCann and FCB are on the same growth path. The social media and content creation capabilities at Weber Shandwick are second to none. If those were standalone groups, they would be among the world's largest digital agencies in their respective disciplines. Golin has a strong realtime digital media offering. Recent acquisitions such as Genuine, Prime and Hudson Global will up the digital game of others in our marketing service specialists. And the addition of Profero is adding an important dimension to Lowe's creative strength.
Turning to the second half of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring, and we will of course remain vigilant on costs and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. But our performance for the first 6 months has been strong on both the top and bottom line.
At this point, we believe that the appropriate organic target for the full 2015 is 4% to 5%. And given our strong growth performance to date, we should aim to deliver in the upper range of our operating margin improvement target of 80 to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we've been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and support and open up the call to questions."

Look, obviously, all of the above. There's a degree of conservancy in there. But as we had said in our previous call, we expected tailwinds in the first half of the year. And frankly, we see that leveling off in the second half of the year, partially because our comps are a little different in the second half of the year and the onboarding of new clients that we had starts to level off in terms of those comps. Plus we had a little bit of headwinds in terms of some of the client losses. So obviously, the second half of the year, we're targeting a little bit pull back on the growth as a result of that impact. Nonetheless, we're still confident in our forecast in the 4% to 5% that we moved it, that's why we moved it in that direction. We always try to do better, but I think that's a realistic number for us to take into account both the uncertainty that's in there -- out there. Let me just comment on the media reviews. Most of these media reviews that are taking place, the impact of that won't be in effect until, really, 2016. So to answer your other question, we don't expect to see an impact on the media side of the business as a result of these reviews until 2016. And hopefully, we'll see positive impact as a result of that."

We don't have built into our plan a recovery in Continental Europe. And along with that, we're managing our costs very carefully. And we hope to see some margin improvement, but Europe continues to be a difficult market for us to expand margins. And we still view it as a very important market for us, so we're continuing to invest in new people and talent in there. And frankly, we've done a few acquisitions there, and we're seeing positive results. But margin improvement is a little bit harder to get in Europe than we're seeing elsewhere in the world."

And over the past couple of years, it has sometimes driven real volatility around 2Q and your outlook. Can you give us a reflection on June, in particular, and what it's telling us about your business and the general environment? And second question is, while you've taken the top line up, kind of a step function, the range in operating leverage at margin was pretty narrow to begin with, right, at 80 to 100 basis points it's 20 bps, and you kind of said so it would be at the upper end of that range. My question is, without a -- there really isn't like a step function up that matches top line, have we sort of maxed out on operating leverage conversion in that you're not getting -- whether or not the top line kind of materially accelerates from here, and this is a pretty good level, do you -- is it possible to sort of start squeezing more operating leverage out incrementally?

And so we still have some cautionary issues out there, particularly in terms of Europe and South America. So therefore, we have some level of conservancy in those numbers. Our margin numbers, we look at it on a full year basis, okay? So when you look at the 6 months and what our conversion ratio in the 6 months, as you know, we look to convert at a 30% ratio. And frankly, for the first -- for this quarter, we didn't quite make 30%, but we're comfortable in our range of 80 to 100 basis points because, the rest of the year, we expect to see the impact of the onboarding of talent that we had in the first half of the year and the revenue coming in, in the second half of the year. We never give up trying to expand our margin. And I think it's a -- 30% continues to be a reasonable objective for us to -- and for you to assume in the conversion as we go forward. And frankly, using the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement, that's where we get to the targets that we're driving against, okay? And I think that's a conservative way for us to look at it. We wrestled with the issue of what we do with that margin expectation, and we felt that by at least saying we think we'll be on the high side of that is an indication to you that we believe we have costs under control in terms of managing it. We still have more work to do. And given the levels of revenue that we see, we're comfortable with that, and we'll deal with future margin expansion as we put this year behind us."

One thing is you can see the difference in terms of the announced gross versus net that our competitors are putting out there, or soon to put out there in terms of their future releases. Our only issue of gross versus net reflects the pass-throughs that we see in some of our marketing services businesses. So you will not see an inflated organic growth number from us as a result of taking inventory into our ownership, in terms of selling it to our clients. So we believe that continues to be a market distinction for us when we're dealing with our clients. Now whether that makes a big difference or not, I think it's still something to be seen in terms of the reviews that are going on. But I can tell you anecdotally and specifically, when we have conversations with our clients about that, all of them indicate that they believe the way we're approaching this is an appropriate way to deal with it. And they're pleased to see the transparency and the positions we're taking. That said, there's no question that some of our competitors are having success going a different way, and that's something we're going to consider and we always will consider as we move into 2016. And frankly, if the marketplace doesn't put a benefit to us in terms of taking that position versus our competitors, then it's something we have to look at in terms of our go-to-market strategy. But right now, we believe, frankly: one, it's the right thing to do in terms of dealing with an agnostic position with respect to our clients. We are an adviser. And as an adviser, will find it inherently difficult to be in a conflict position when we are advising them on where they should place their media dollars. And we believe that, that is the right go-to-market strategy. If clients, however, feel that as long as they're getting a savings and they're getting a benefit in terms of where their media dollars are being spent, and that doesn't make a difference, then we'll take a look at it. But right now, we believe it's making a difference in the marketplace. I cannot tell you that we won this particular pitch, which is what your question is, because of that because these pitches that are going on right now, I know a lot of ink is being spent in terms of making a point that this issue of transparency and rebates is why these reviews are taking place. But, actually, these reviews are taking place because clients want to make sure that their media dollars are being spent appropriately in terms of efficiently, in the right place and using all the tools and resources that are out there. And they want to make sure that they're getting best-in-class services. And frankly, if I were a client, I'd be asking the same questions. So it's not down to a pure question of taking inventory or not taking inventory or transparency or not transparency. It's everything being considered at one time. And we're very comfortable with our position, and we lead with that in terms of our go-to-market strategy."

That said, some of them are successful and some of them aren't. Our approach has been quite successful. I mean, I used Huge as an example. When we acquired Huge, they had 80 to 100 people. Now they have 800 to 1,000 people on a worldwide basis. There aren't many of those transactions, but those are the kind of transactions that we look at. We look at small to medium acquisitions that are in the sweet spot of the areas that we need the expertise, whether it be digital, which obviously is what everybody is looking at right now, or a geographic area or it's a discipline. So we've done a number of transactions in our PR business. Obviously, our PR business is very successful, and we're certainly gaining market share against our competitors. So therefore, when we look at opportunities in acquisitions, if we can bolster their go-to-market strategy, that's a good thing, and we find transactions that it's appropriate in. So don't expect us to announce a huge transaction on the M&A side, but we are looking, on a very careful basis, to be within the range. We always say we spend between $100 million, $150 million. We can go up above that a little bit, obviously, if the right transaction comes along, but we're very careful and disciplined in terms of our acquisitions."

Yes, it's out there. And my favorite slide that I show when I make presentations is a headline in The Wall Street Journal that says the demise of the advertising industry because of all these new technologies and so on. And then, of course, my next slide is that quote was 25 years ago. Look, we have to be on our toes. We have to continue to invest in what works and what clients are looking for. And as long as we can add that value to clients, there's no need for them to take it in-house or use other services. I think what we're seeing actually now, because of the distribution of media outlets right now, most of our clients are looking for solutions because it's very difficult for them, on their own, to really go through all of these different outlets on an integrated basis. So I think the value proposition that we have now is as strong as it's ever been. And as long as we have the type of -- whether it be programmatic buying, whether it be content, whether it be PR, whether it be content creation, all of it, and distribution on a global basis. And we are the only place, and I say we as an industry, we are the only place where we can bring all of this together, and hopefully, on an agnostic basis, to advise our clients where to put their money. So I think our value proposition right now is as strong as it's ever been. And yes, our clients are going to look to make sure that we're doing it efficiently. And it's no different than when we look at acquisitions. Do we choose to grow it organically or buy it? So the buy versus rent argument is out there, and it always is an analysis and it's incumbent upon us to show that we have the tools and resources to help our clients. And if we don't, they're either going to do it themselves or use some of the other providers. So do I think it's challenging? Yes. Do I think we've stepped up to the plate? Yes. Do I think we have to do more? Of course. And that's really what's driving a lot of these media pitches right now. They want to make sure that they're getting the best, and so that they could make decisions with respect to how they move their business going forward. And they're looking to us to provide a solution. And if we can't do that, they'll look for other solutions, and that's no different than it's been 25 years ago. And we just have to stay ahead of the curve. And I know our competitors, whether it be the tech companies or consulting companies, are trying to have inroads in there, in addition to clients taking it in-house, but if you -- I talked about this in Cannes. The creativity part of this is something that I think we tend to lose sight of. And that is we do have that secret sauce, as I put it, in terms of bringing that creative aspect to all of these different tools and resources. And we're the ones who are going to provide that because this is where the talent wants to be. To work with these clients, whether they be global clients or domestic clients, these creative people are looking to do that, and we provide that. It's very difficult for these tech companies or consulting companies to recruit and retain the talent that we have in the organization. If you just look at McCann and FCB in terms -- as well as the rest of our businesses. But whether you look at a Rob Reilly or a Susan Credle or any of the other creative people we have within our organizations, those talented people are looking to our industry to use their talent. And it's tough to get those kind of people and keep them engaged the way we do. So I think the demise of our business is not something that's going to happen. And it's just -- we just have to remain on our toes to make sure that we continue to invest in people, leverage our creativity expertise and make sure we have the tools and resources to help our clients."

I guess, on a pure numbers basis, you can look at our leverage and see that we're probably under-levered, okay? And especially with the investment grade, I know the next part of your question is are we going to be putting in a commercial paper program and use some of our excess cash. We're managing our cash flow, our treasury department, financial log, Frank and his organization. We look at this very carefully. And frankly, if the opportunity is out there for us to put in a commercial paper program and it's beneficial to us, we will do that. And that should free up some opportunity for us to look at return to shareholders, whether it be in the form of dividends or buybacks. We still have plenty left in our buyback authorization. We have over $300 million left, and we intend to use that. And so I like the position we're in right now, from a financial audit position. And as we get stronger on the macroeconomic environment, then we'll look at the appropriate leverage. And I think that's what we've done for years, and that's the way it should be right now. A knee-jerk reaction to put on a large amount of debt to buy back shares, for example, which a number of people would argue, I think is a short-term play versus a long-term play. But we do look at this, and it's incumbent upon us to review those transactions with our Board, which we do. And we'll make a call between buybacks, using our leverage and dividend distribution. I mean, that's what we owe to our shareholders, and that's how we view it."

Frankly, I don't think we get credit for the strength of our digital offerings. So that's why we spent so much time in our comments to show our strength in digital. You're asking me which of my children do I like better. I think what our results show is that we have strong offerings across the board. And our global networks, McCann, obviously, is on the front foot and doing very well. FCB, Mullen Lowe, these are very powerful networks on a global basis, and we're seeing the results of investments we've made, restructurings that we've done, particularly, for example, Mullen Lowe. We brought in new talent at McCann and FCB. And I think -- I don't think, I know we're seeing the results of that. I think McCann is a perfect example in terms of Harris and his entire team and the people that he's been able to bring into McCann, we're seeing results. And so that is a very competitive offering in the marketplace, and that's certainly, along with FCB and Lowe -- Mullen Lowe, excuse me, contributing to the growth that we're seeing. And yes, in a way, we're taking market share. That doesn't mean that our digital offerings, the R/GAs, the Huge, the Profero, the MRMs, all these -- we have some siloed digital offerings that are, frankly, double-digit growth, so they're helping us a lot. Our marketing services, Weber Shandwick and Golin, are taking market share. I don't think there's any question that we're seeing that. And media is a strong performer for us, and we're very comfortable. We made some personnel changes in media. I think Henry is putting together a great team. He has extensive experience in media, and it's helping us in these pitches that we're involved in now. I'm feeling pretty positive about where we stand in these pitches that are out there. As I said, we're defending clients that we have a long-standing relationship, I'm comfortable with that. And in those situations where we're new to the block, we hope to pick up some additional revenue. So I think it's all of the above is why we're performing. And frankly, that's why investors should be looking at us. It's not just a one-trick pony, it's not an overweight in one particular area, whether it be media or whatever. And on a global basis, we're well distributed in terms of our sources of revenue. So if you put it all together, you end up with an organic growth that we have, and that's what makes a competitive organization. And frankly, that's why we're feeling good about this particular result that we're showing because it's across the board, it's not just one particular network or organization or discipline that's contributing to it."

Of course, we had a particular issue in Brazil that we had to deal with, I'm not going to bury our head to it. And frankly, we'll be able to put that behind us, and we feel we have -- we certainly have that fenced in right now. But it's a market that is going through a lot of changes down there, and so we're cautious about it. Fortunately, in LatAm, we're seeing strength in Mexico and Argentina, so that's offsetting some of the weakness we're seeing in Brazil. And so for the full year, although we're down in the quarter, we're relatively flat, we hope, for the full year. And I think that really reflects what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. Of course, coming into next year, we hope to see a pickup in Brazil because we do have events coming there. And hopefully, particularly, with our marketing service businesses, we can provide some kick to the organic side of the business. But it's a concern. The other side of it is, of course, it's not a major part of our business, and that's one of the benefits of our global footprint."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue and profit growth. Organic revenue growth in our third quarter was 7.1%, on top of the very strong comps from a year ago. 
Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 10 basis points, while OpEx was a negative 5.9%. However, FX had very little impact on our operating margin. Total revenue growth was 1.3%. 
We continue to see positive contributions to our top line performance from a broad range of our creative, media and marketing services offerings. 
Across the group, our digital capabilities were again significant drivers of growth. We also continue to drive strong growth in our largest regional markets, with the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. all showing very good advances.  Organic growth in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter. 
From a standpoint of client sectors, we saw a growth across all client verticals. The best performance came in tech and telecom, financial services, food and beverage and health care. Our operating profit in the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 12% from a year ago. Q3 operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 10.3%. 
We had leverage on both our salaries and related and office and general expenses. 
Worth noting that below operating profit, other expenses in the quarter includes charges totaling $38 million to dispose certain smaller business units, which were underperforming and which we deem as nonstrategic, all of which were outside the U.S. Most of the expense was noncash. Frank will have more color in his comments. 
The after-tax expense was $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.08 for the 9 months. Excluding the charge of the disposition, diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.27, an increase of 29% compared to the prior period. 
Looking at the first 9 months. Organic revenue growth was 6.5% on top of 5.9% a year ago. We posted a 17% increased to operating profit and a 34% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. This represents industry-leading organic revenue growth and profit growth. That's an accomplishment, which call our people across the company to be proud of. 
Turning back to a bit more detail on the quarter. U.S. organic growth was 7.1% on top of 7.9% a year ago, which is an outstanding result. We had growth at most of our agencies, notably McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Deutsche, R/GA, Weber Shandwick and Golin. 
International growth was 7.1%, once again, driven by a full range of services. 
By region, we were led by 14.4% growth in LatAm, where we saw increases in most national markets. Asia Pac increased 7.2% organically and was highlighted by our continuing strong trends in India and China. 
In the U.K., organic growth was 5.2%, on top of last year's 12% growth. We were led by the growth of R/GA and our marketing services specialist at CMG. 
In Continental Europe, Q3 organic growth was essentially flat, and we continue to stay focused on improving our talent and capabilities in this region. 
The first 9 months, 6.5% organic growth reflected growth in every region of the world, and contributions across all major disciplines. 
9 months operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses. 
As we said previously, supporting our best-in-class offerings as well as cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be our top priorities, and we are successfully executing against those objectives. 
With respect to share repurchase, during Q3, we used $70 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares. 
Through 9 months, we view the life approximately $172 million of share repurchases, and we had $271 million remaining on our authorization as of September 30. 
Since instituting our return of capital program in 2011, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduce that dilutive share count by 26%. 
In sum, our performance in the quarter and year-to-date continues to demonstrate industry leadership and the strong position of our offerings. 
Adding into our important fourth quarter, economic conditions in some areas of the world represent macro headwinds and uncertainties. While those have been incorporated into our outlook, the overall tone of business nonetheless, remained solid, and we continue to effectively manage expenses. 
Previously, we increased our full year and 2015 organic growth target to 4% to 5%. Our strong performance through 9 months has us attract to exceed 5%. 
We also remain well positioned to achieved 100 basis points of margin expansion this year, the high end of our targeted range. 
With that overview, I'll turn it the Frank for additional detail in our results, and I'll join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see some of our results. Organic growth of 7.1% in the third quarter evenly balanced between the U.S. and international. In our first 9 months, organic revenue growth was 6.5%. 
Q3 operating profit was $192 million, an increase of 12%. For the first 9 months, operating profit grew 17%. 
Q3 margin of 10.3% improved 100 basis points and our margin for the 9 months also improved 100 basis points. 
We had below the line charge of $38 million for the disposition of selected non-U.S. business units. Most of the charge is the balance sheet write-off of currency translation adjustments built up over the years, with the balance representing the net assets of the disposed businesses. 
This pertains to a handful of business for which revenue was small with noncash translation adjustments magnified by large FX changes over the years. The impact of this charge reported diluted EPS was $0.09 for the quarter. 
Including the charge, diluted EPS was $0.27, which compares to Q3 2014 at 21%, a 29% increase.  Q3 fully diluted shares decreased 3% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides a s follows. I've already covered the disposition related charges, other expenses. 
Slide 4 has more detail in our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.87 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. 
Compared to Q3 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was a negative 5.9%, it's $1 significantly stronger in all regions of the world. 
Acquisitions added 10 basis points to revenue. The result in organic revenue increase was 7.1%. 
As you can see in the bottom half of the slide, at our Integrated Agency Network, the organic increase was 8%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB, by Mediabrands, Deutsche and by R/GA.  IAN's growth was 7.5% over the first 9 months. 
At our CMG segment, Q3 organic growth was 3.7%. We continue to have very strong growth at our PR agencies, notably Weber Shandwick and Golin, which grew at double-digit rates. 
Organic growth was 2.5% at CMG for the first 9 months, but was mid-single digit increase excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was outstanding at 7.1%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of agencies, disciplines and client sectors.  For the 9 months, organic growth was 7%. 
In the U.K., Q3 organic growth was 5.2%, on top of 12.2% last year. We had notably strong performance at R/GA, McCann, Octagon and Weber Shandwick. 
For the 9 months, organic growth was 6.5%. 
Continental Europe is essentially flat organically in Q3. Our largest markets in the continent were mixed with Spain up organically, Italy and France flat and Germany down. 
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q3 organic growth was 7.2%, propelled by strong growth in China and India. Growth for the 9 months was 8.4%, a performance that speaks to the strength of positioning across our integrated global agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings. 
In LatAm, our organic increase was 14.4% in the quarter.  We continue to see a very strong performance in most national markets such as Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, which is consistent with the first half of the year. 
We also had improved quarter in Brazil although business conditions generally remain challenging there. 
In the quarter, we had leading contributions to growth in the region by McCann, Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge. 
Our other markets group, which made up of Canada and the Middle East and Africa, grew 13.5% organically in the quarter due chiefly to strong performance in the Middle East as well as growth in Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 20 basis points from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%.  As a result, margin expanded 100 basis points. 
Underneath that performance, our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue in the quarter was 64.4% this year, an improvement of 50 basis points from a year ago. 
We had 50 basis points of leverage in our base payroll, benefits and tax expense as well as 20 basis points on temporary labor. 
Our accrual point incented increased by 40 basis points as a percent of revenue, driven by our strong operating performance. 
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,700, an increase of 3.2% year-on-year. 
The increase chiefly reflects organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative and PR as well as regionally in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac. 
Turning to ops and general expenses in the lower half of the slide. O&G expenses was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with 25.8% a year ago, an improvement of 50 basis points. Our improvement was driven by leverage on expenses for occupancy, travel, office supplies and telecom and all other O&G expense. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history in the trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.1%. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the third quarter with $881 million cash and short-term marketable securities. 
Comparison to December 31 reflects our cash level seasonal intense to peak at year-end. 
On Slide 10, we turn to our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $281 million compared with $176 million a year ago. Working capital is a source of $140 million -- $154 million this year compared with the use of $11 million in Q3 2014. 
Investing activities used $41 million in the quarter primarily for CapEx. Financing activities used $151 million, mainly in capital return to shareholders, $70 million per share repurchases and $48 million per common stock dividends.  Our net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $26 million. 
On Slide 11, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.75 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the year-to-date represents very solid performance and progress for meeting our financial objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost discipline and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward. 
With that said, let me turn it back to Michael."

In terms of organic revenue growth and margin progress, Q3 continues to make us a leader in our peer group. Contributions came from across the portfolio in terms of agencies, geography, client categories, all fueled by the outstanding creativity, insights and digital capabilities that we have throughout Interpublic. 
Our success is a reflection of the strength of our offerings and our client-centric focus.  Ultimately, it is driven by the caliber of our people. Across the group, we continue to see evidence that Interpublic and our agencies are consistently a first choice for the industry's best talent. 
For some time, talent has been a top strategic priority for us, one that has fueled our return of levels of organic growth that is fully competitive or better. We are proud that our culture has become a differentiator for us, and has our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, where we have a strong and established track record as the leader in our space. 
On our call last quarter, we drilled down and provide a greater focus on the role of digital expertise is playing in all of the work that we do for our clients, from advertising through media and marketing services. We pointed out that unlike others in our space, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our disciplines. This commitment to incubating new skills, developing new products and services and investing in new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. It gives us confidence that our offerings are forward facing, competitive and increasingly vale to clients as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape. 
Operationally, it's clear that we continue to be disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement for the year. 
We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that have been driving further value creation for our shareholders. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, the tone of the business is solid. Clients are being measured in their approach, but the year-end period will be key to delivering for all marketers, and they are relying on partners that have the tools, insights and capabilities to connect with consumers across channels and drive desired business outcomes. 
We remain cautious on Europe, although our plans did not factor in growth in that region. The Brazilian and Chinese economies have been challenged, although our operations in those regions continue to deliver results. 
The new business pipeline is solid. Year-to-date, we continue to be net new business positive. And in fact, near the top of the new business league tables. 
The significant number of media pictures continue, and it bears noting that we've been performing well to date with a number of headline wins, notably UM's wins of the Coca-Cola media review, J&J U.S. media buying and planning accounts as well as CVS and McCormick, which was 1 in collaboration with R/GA. 
Those are reflection of the cutting-edge offerings we have within Mediabrands in terms of strategic media thinkers, outstanding digital and data platforms and the scale and expertise to deliver buying efficiency to some of the world's largest and most demanding clients. 
An additional point that is worth repeating when it comes to emerging media is that we do not take ownership of the digital media for resale to clients so our strong organic growth does not reflect the growth of digital media arbitrage revenue that you're seeing among some of our peers. We take principal positions and resell own inventory to clients at a margin. 
We continue to believe that our role as an agnostic consultant is key and allows us to provide clients with the recommendations and services that are best for their business. 
We also remain committed to the highest standing of transparency, an area in which we been a leader for some time. This continues to gain an importance as the world of digital media is beset by challenges surrounding viewability and other issues that make it imperative that we serve as wholly objective partners to our clients. 
McCann continues to post strong performance with outstanding creative work on its major multinationals and notable local market wins in the U.K., Australia and India. We're seeing great collaboration within group and this cross selling and integration is helping them win new accounts as well as increase their share of wallet with existing clients. The digital and health care units within McCann had strong performance. 
In the health care space, it was good to see that McCann Health and FCB Health led us to outstanding performance at the medical marketing and media competition, where we've bested the other holding companies in terms of awards won. 
Progress at FCB continues. The agency is consistently appearing on pitch list with notable recent wins with Lincoln Financial by the New York office, BMO Harris Bank by the Toronto office, new work from Coke at the SGV in South Africa and strong momentum at Inferno FCB in London. 
FCB Health remains a powerhouse in its field and the agency sharper marketing operation, FCB is also a very strong resource. 
At CMG, our award-winning public relations, Weber Shandwick and Golin, continue to gain market share. 
Beyond digital with both firms have been in the forefront of their discipline, they are also moving into content marketing and upstream to more strategic and integrated opportunities. 
We are well positioned here, and we are also seeing good progress from our sports and entertainment and experiential businesses as well as continuing improvement in the branding sector. 
Focus on Mullen Lowe during the quarter were squarely on merger integration and setting the stage for a successful 2016 and beyond. The agency senior global leadership recently met to decide on and articulate the network's market position, strategy and brand identity. This will include both agencies long-standing commitment to creative excellence. Mullen's contemporary hyper bundled approach and Lowe's deep knowledge of dynamic international markets, it's a combination that's working for many leading clients, including Unilever, and we look forward to seeing positive momentum in the marketplace. 
Our U.S. independence continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Deutsch is an example of the benefits of combining big, creative ideas with a fully integrated suite of digital capabilities. 
The marketing agency, Hill Holliday and Carmichael Lynch, are other agencies that deliver with this model and provides us with a range of options that commit to needs of domestic clients. 
In terms of digital, our offerings are consistently outstanding, whether it be our social media capabilities and Weber and Golin, [indiscernible] and AMP within Mediabrands, we're the integrated digital capabilities at all of our brand agencies. 
MRM is a top tiered digital network and the close collaborations we are seeing with them and McCann is elevating the world group offering. Just as the integration of Profero and MediaHub are significantly strengthening Mullen Lowe's go-to-market positioning. 
We're also fortunate to have R/GA, the undisputed leader in digital and technology enabled marketing. They continue to win business and awards as well as innovative programs such as the R/GA Accelerates that give us a line of sight into terrific start-ups with ideas and technology that will play a role in shaping the future of communications and consumer experience. 
Our current accelerators taking place in Los Angeles in collaboration with L.A. Dodgers and the participating companies spend every aspect of connected sport, from athlete training, to venue management, to new social channels in which consumers can share their passion for sports. 
Huge is another digital specialist that has performed exceptionally well for us. Beyond this industry-leading strategic consulting, design and new practices, the agency recently made news when it opened a coffee shop in its Atlanta office to serve as a realtime lab in which we will develop and test digital retail innovations with both current and prospective clients. 
[indiscernible] Interpublic, the new business of advertising means that we encourage ambitious change across the entire organization. 
By providing access to emerging and transfer made technologies, we develop programs that help us attract talent and great work that puts us the user experience first, all in the service of our clients. 
Looking to the balance of this year, we stayed diligent on cost so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin commitment. The geographic markets that we will need to monitor. The performance for the first 9 months has been very strong and positions us well for a strong close to the full year. 
As mentioned in my initial remarks, we believe that given our performance to date, the appropriate organic revenue growth targets for the new year is in excess of 5%, and that we're on track to deliver 100 basis points of operating margin improvement at the end of our initial target to the year -- at the high end of our initial target. 
Moving forward, we're, therefore, closer to our achieving our previously stated goal of 13%. 
Combined with our company's financial strength and robust return of capital, which have and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and continued support and open the call up for questions."

Look, none of this is by accident. We started on this journey by clearly investing in talent. And I think what you're seeing right now is the fact that the talent that we've embedded within all our organizations is really shining in terms of what clients are looking for in terms of moving the needle with their business. But creative talent and overall talent needs tools and resources within the organization to make sure we can deliver on that. So we've invested in all these tools and resources throughout the company. And finally, we really are a client-centric environment. And so everyone is focusing on the needs of the clients and therefore, we're focusing on what we can bring to the resources within IPG to the client to meet those needs. We're seeing success in our open architecture model, where if you look at the business wins, all of our agencies are aware of the fact that if their particular disciplines need other resources from IPG, they raise their hand, and we bring the additional IPG resources to the table. And frankly, we're getting a reputation in the marketplace appropriately that we do this very well, and we really focus on the needs of the clients versus our own silos. And I think the new business wins that we're seeing as well as the embedded growth we're seeing in our existing client base really is indicative of the fact that all the IPG resources are available to move the needle with our client, and we're executing against that. But in the end, it takes people and belief by those people that they have a huge resource base behind them and the other thing, which we particularly like, is when I participate in a lot of these pitches, what we see in the room are cross disciplines either from within the agencies or outside IPG. And it's not uncommon for the client to come up to me and say, I didn't even realize which individuals work from which discipline and that's really what clients are looking for in their resources. So I'm particularly proud of all our agencies, whether it be our traditional agencies, our digital agencies, our marketing services, PR. I mean, across the board, we're all doing quite well."

So I mean, there are always people out there saying that the competitors and there are other disciplines, whether it be Ad Tech or smaller agencies. In the end, we have the resources and capabilities that can compete with any resource out there. And frankly, when we don't have it, yes, we use outside parties, we work well with them. It's incumbent upon us to know what we do well and what we don't do well. And that's what this whole concept of open architecture is all about, John. And that is, we're looking at the client first. And if we don't have a resource internally and when I say internally, I mean, within IPG, it's not uncommon for us to use outside resources to help us. And frankly, that's what shows clients that we're thinking of them versus ourselves. And yes, we end up dealing with nontraditional people, whether it be on the ad deck side, even in some of the production, they don't like it, but even some of the production facilities that clients request us to use, we have to be in a world now where collaboration works. And the collaboration starts with us and if it's not within our organization, we have to be able to collaborate with other parties that clients are happy with. So we're able to do all of that. And sometimes, working with the third parties turns out to be a lot smoother than sometimes working with ourselves, which is shame on us, but that's the reality of the world out there. So the world is changing and our model has to change with us. And I think that's one of the things you're seeing why we're being successful in that we're not ready to the silo mentality of the past. We have to collaborate, we have to collaborate within IPG, and we have to collaborate outside of IPG with other partners."

So as part of the pitch, we present ideas and our people from Cadreon present what we're doing, and you see the client sitting there saying, oh my goodness, how come we didn't think of that?

And if it means helping them bring it inside, that's okay, but they're still going to need the current thinking and the investments that we make in these tools that clients just are in a position to make. And frankly, the talent that we're able to recruit in that environment is so different than the talent that you can recruit internally on a solid basis. So yes, clients are bringing it in. It's not a threat, it's just another tool that clients have, that they want us to work with in the overall integrator offering, and we have to be able to do that. The history of our industry is when clients bring things internally, a lot of times it comes back. And the reason for it is the ability of the recruit talent as well as to keep talent in tools and resources that you need to be current. So yes, it's a phenomena, there's no question about it, and clients are trying to do it internally. But I think they'll find in the long term that we still have a role to play here in helping them accomplish what they're looking for, but at the same time, using the tools and resources that we have that they're not capable of developing. So we don't fight it, we actually help them do it. And that's -- again, that's one piece of the puzzle. I mean, again, if this is a relationship with a client, it has to be broad, and it has to be seen as if we're in a partnership with a client, and we have all these different resources that we bring to the table. If the client feels comfortable asking us to help them, we don't view it them as taking business away from us, it's part of what our role is, and we have to build it into our model. But it's the reality, but it's been reality for years in this industry, and it just changes the performance."

So with regard to the reviews, we see headlines out there sometimes from large clients suggesting that they're going to use the review process to drive down their aggregate fees, right? Just wondering if you could comment on that, the idea that coming out of this process set holes that the total fee envelope available to all of you guys is smaller. And I guess, the other piece of this that doesn't get talked about as much is, the situations where the scope of work actually expands. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about the first part. And then what kind of expansion might you see as you get into these reviews, where, who knows, fees could actually go up?"

I mean, look, any review that go take place clearly has a view towards what they call efficiencies. Efficiencies, obviously, means fee reductions. And clients for generations have been looking for more for less. So it's something that we're very much used to, and it puts the burden on us to be more efficient, but yet we have to be able to meet the needs of the clients. And yes, that presents problems in terms of us maintaining margin. But again, remember, this is only one piece of the puzzle. When we talk about margins, it's aggregate margins and all the different disciplines and resources. And sure, on some cases, contract work that we have an scope, margins maybe a little bit less than may have been before. But in the end, it's our opportunity and clients expect it for us to be able to bring in new ideas that help them move the needle, and that's what's it's called known is as ad scope work. And ad scope work is typically we get higher margins on. That's the way how our business works. And clients know that. But first, they have to start with the line on the sand. So these reviews establish a line in the sand in terms of scope of work and fees that will be available. And we have to work within that model, and it's incumbent upon us to make sure that the additional work that we do and clients understand that if it's ad the scope, they have to pay for it, and we typically make better margin on the ad scope work, that's not a secret in our industry and clients know it. And the other part of it is, this is a value-based environment. And if we can show that we're moving the needle and clients value the type -- the ideas that we're being to them and the fact that it's in fact proving the results that we believe it can do, clients have incentive fees with us, the performance-based contracts that we have, particularly on the media side of the business. So there are vehicles that we have to develop opportunities for us to enhance margins, and that's the way the business is. And so we don't view procurement as a bad word, we don't view as these reviews as necessarily being of only with the view toward the fee reductions. The other reasons these views are taking place is because they want to see if they're getting best-in-class offerings. And frankly, if I was a client, I'd be asking the same thing. So we approached these reviews even when we're incumbents as an opportunity to show clients and future clients what we can bring to the table, what resources we have and how we can work differently with them to move the needle. What's interesting is the incumbents usually start out as, why haven't you put this to us before. So therefore, if you look at the history of reviews, incumbents generally don't do well. But when you really drill down on it, incumbents have been dealing within a certain playbook, both with the client and ourselves. These reviews open up a different playbook, and that means there's got to be change both on the client side as well as our side. And I see that's what's happening in a number of these reviews. Clients are recognizing that their approach isn't necessarily the right approach and they're willing to think of a different approach that can bring to the table. And that means opportunity. Every time we get to work with our clients and show that we can do, it presents opportunities for us across the board. So that's how we approach it."

The A&A has been talking about this, [indiscernible] has been talking about this. Everybody has been talking about it.

But we've been talking about transparency. It started with us, frankly, 10 years ago, maybe it's 11 now, time flies when we're having a good time, on the issue of rebates. So this is nothing that we're afraid of. We've been very clear on rebate issues for 10 years now. It's in all our contracts. We welcome, in fact, in all these reviews, we have audit capabilities from our clients to come in and review this, so this isn't new for us. And as part of the verification and audit that we have within our own systems, clients are welcome to come in and in fact, we do share with them results from that and some -- one of the firms that are doing this actually we worked with them in the past. So this is really nothing new for us in our industry. Any type of review like this, everyone raises questions on what they're going to find. It's unfortunate that the headlines, particularly in Europe have made it look like this is a criminal investigation. Last I look the A&A doesn't have the ability to subpoena. If you read these headlines, you would think that, that's what's going on. That's not what's going on, it's a look into the practices within an industry, that's nothing new. This is an industry organization making sure that their constituents are comfortable what's going on in the practice. And we've been dealing with this all along. So from an IPG perspective, we are very comfortable on rebate transparency, we are very comfortable on contractual transparency, we have it in all our contracts, and verification and review was part of our process, so there's nothing in any of that, that concerns us."

More and more, these are fees that are coming into the holding company, they're coming directly to me directly and something, which is why I have to look at my e-mails everyday. But it really comes in to the holding company and they're saying, you tell us what is the best way you want to approach this RFP. So someone like Simon with his vast experience in new business and client focus and frankly, his knowledge on the consulting industry and the relationships he has is a tremendous asset for us. And frankly, Simon has already been involved with a number of our agencies, pitches that are going on right now. And he's a resource. And we're from the home office, and we're here to help.

And frankly, we have a couple of wins that he helped in terms of the presentation. So the fact that we were able to recruit Simon is an indication to me that this whole notion of open architecture is one that is resonating in the industry and our reputation for being a holding company that collaborates with all the agencies within the holding company is real. And I think his presence, along with the other individuals within IPG, would it be Peter or Terry, they all work very closely with our agencies.

And you can focus on that by generating revenue, which is what we've been doing and keeping an eye on those cost pressures and the SRS. So we've done a great job in O&G, and that's showing an improvement even in the third quarter, we're seeing improvement there. We've seen leverage, we've seen at least 50 basis points, and if you worked through the pass-throughs, it's really 80 basis points this quarter in terms of leverage on SRS.

We can do this and I've said this before, we can get there tomorrow, but part of this is making sure we have the talent and resources to generate growth. So on a longer-term basis, had we not had the talent and resources there we have within all our different agencies, we wouldn't be delivering the results that you're seeing right now. So if we start the pipeline of people and got to our SRS ratios in line quicker, yes, we may achieve our goal, but our long-term viability would be adversely affected. I kind of like the way we're doing it now. If you're looking at 80 to 100 basis points margin improvement at clips along the way, we're going to get there.

Just look at the write off that we're having. We're focusing on unprofitable businesses that are in geographic locations, that aren't necessary, that are a drag on our P&L. And so this time, the $38 million is 4 to 5 locations in areas that we don't have to be, they were dilutive. And we either sold them or closed them, and that's how we get there.

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by Q&A.
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue and profit growth. Organic revenue growth in our third quarter was 7.1%, on top of the very strong comps from a year ago. 
Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 10 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.9%. However, FX had very little impact on our operating margin. Total revenue growth was 1.3%. We continue to see positive contributions to our top line performance from a broad range of our creative, media and marketing services offerings.
Across the group, our digital capabilities were again significant drivers of growth. We also continue to drive strong growth in our largest regional markets, with the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. all showing very good advances. Organic growth in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter.
In the standpoint of client sectors, we saw a growth across all client verticals. The best performance came in tech and telecom, financial services, food and beverage and health care. Our operating profit in the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 12% from a year ago. Q3 operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 10.3%. We had leverage on both our salaries and related and office and general expenses.
Worth noting that below operating profit, other expenses in the quarter includes charges totaling $38 million to dispose of certain smaller business units which were underperforming and which we deemed as nonstrategic, all of which were outside the U.S. Most of the expense was noncash. Frank will have more color in his comments.
The after-tax expense was $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.08 for the 9 months. Excluding the charge of the disposition, diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.27, an increase of 29% compared to the period -- prior period.
Looking at the first 9 months. Organic revenue growth was 6.5% on top of 5.9% a year ago. We posted a 17% increase to operating profit and a 34% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. This represents industry-leading organic revenue growth and profit growth. That's an accomplishment which all our people across the company can be proud of.
Turning back to a bit more detail on the quarter. U.S. organic growth was 7.1% on top of 7.9% a year ago, which is an outstanding result. We had growth at most of our agencies, notably McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Deutsche, R/GA, Weber Shandwick and Golin. International growth was 7.1%, once again driven by our full range of services.
By region, we were led by 14.4% growth in LatAm, where we saw increases in most national markets. Asia Pac increased 7.2% organically and was highlighted by our continuing strong trends in India and China.
In the U.K., organic growth was 5.2%, on top of last year's 12% growth. We were led by the growth of R/GA and our marketing services specialist at CMG. In Continental Europe, Q3 organic growth was essentially flat, and we continue to stay focused on improving our talent and capabilities in this region.
In the first 9 months, 6.5% organic growth reflected growth in every region of the world and contributions across all major disciplines. 9 months operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses.
As we said previously, supporting our best-in-class offerings as well as cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be our top priorities, and we are successfully executing against those objectives.
With respect to share repurchase, during Q3, we used $70 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares. Through 9 months, we've utilized approximately $172 million to share repurchases, and we had $271 million remaining on our authorization as of September 30.
Since instituting our return to capital programs in 2011, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduce that dilutive share count by 26%.
In sum, our performance in the quarter and year-to-date continues to demonstrate industry leadership and the strong position of our offerings.
Heading into our important fourth quarter, economic conditions in some areas of the world will present macro headwinds and uncertainties. While those have been incorporated into our outlook, the overall tone of business nonetheless remained solid, and we continue to effectively manage expenses.
Previously, we increased our full year and 2015 organic growth target to 4% to 5%. Our strong performance through 9 months has us attract [ph] to exceed 5%. We also remain well positioned to achieve 100 basis points of margin expansion this year, the high end of our targeted range.
With that overview, I'll turn it to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
On Slide 2, you'll see summary of our results. Organic growth of 7.1% in the third quarter, evenly balanced between the U.S. and international. In our first 9 months, organic revenue growth was 6.5%.
Q3 operating profit was $192 million, an increase of 12%. In the first 9 months, operating profit grew 17%. Q3 margin of 10.3% improved 100 basis points, and our margin for the 9 months also improved 100 basis points.
We had a below-the-line charge of $38 million for the disposition of selected non-U.S. business units. Most of the charge is the balance sheet write-off of currency translation adjustments built up over the years, with the balance representing the net assets of the disposed businesses.
This pertains to a handful of business for which revenue was small, with noncash translation adjustments magnified by large FX changes over the years. The impact of this charge to reported diluted EPS was $0.09 for the quarter.
Including the charge, diluted EPS was $0.27, which compares to Q3 2014 at 21%, a 29% increase. Q3 fully diluted shares decreased 3% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. I've already covered the disposition-related charge at other expenses.
Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.87 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q3 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was a negative 5.9%, with the dollar significantly stronger in all regions of the world. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to revenue. The result in organic revenue increase was 7.1%.
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 8%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB, by Mediabrands, Deutsche and by R/GA. IAN's growth was 7.5% over the first 9 months.
At our CMG segment, Q3 organic growth was 3.7%. We continue to have very strong growth at our PR agencies, notably Weber Shandwick and Golin, which grew at double-digit rates. Organic growth was 2.5% at CMG for the first 9 months, but was a [ph] mid-single digit increase, excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was outstanding at 7.1%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of agencies, disciplines and client sectors. For the 9 months, organic growth was 7%.
In the U.K., Q3 organic growth was 5.2%, on top of 12.2% last year. We had notably strong performance at R/GA, McCann, Octagon and Weber Shandwick. For the 9 months, organic growth was 6.5%.
Continental Europe is essentially flat organically in Q3. Our largest markets in the continent were mixed with Spain up organically, Italy and France flat and Germany down.
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q3 organic growth was 7.2%, propelled by strong growth in China and India. Growth for the 9 months was 8.4%, a performance that speaks to the strength of our positioning across our global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings.
In LatAm, our organic increase was 14.4% in the quarter. We continue to see a very strong performance in most national markets such as Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, which is consistent with the first half of the year. We also had improved quarter in brazil, although business conditions generally remained challenging there. In the quarter, we had leading contributions to growth in the region by McCann, Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge.
Our Other Markets group, which made up of Canada and the Middle East and Africa, grew 13.5% organically in the quarter due chiefly to strong performance in the Middle East as well as growth in Canada.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 20 basis points from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. As a result, margin expanded 100 basis points.
Underneath that performance, our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue in the quarter was 64.4% this year, an improvement of 50 basis points from a year ago. We had 50 basis points of leverage in our base payroll, benefits and tax expense as well as 20 points -- basis points on temporary labor. Our accrual for incentives increased by 40 basis points as a percent of revenue, driven by our strong operating performance.
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,700, an increase of 3.2% year-on-year. The increase chiefly reflects organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, health care and PR as well as regionally in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac.
Turning to ops and general expenses on the lower half of this slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with 25.8% a year ago, an improvement of 50 basis points. Our improvement was driven by leverage on expenses for occupancy, travel, office supplies and telecom and all other O&G expense.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.1%.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the third quarter with $881 million cash and short-term marketable securities. Comparison to December 31 reflects our cash level as seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
On Slide 10, we turn to our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $281 million compared with $176 million a year ago. Working capital is a source of $140 million -- $154 million this year compared with the use of $11 million in Q3 2014.
Investing activities used $41 million in the quarter, primarily for CapEx. Financing activities used $151 million, mainly in capital returned to shareholders, $70 million for share repurchases and $48 million for common stock dividends. Our net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $26 million.
On Slide 11, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.75 billion at the most recent quarter end.
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the year-to-date represents very solid performance and progress for meeting our financial objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost discipline and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that said, let me turn it back to Michael."

In terms of organic revenue growth and margin progress, Q3 continues to make us a leader in our peer group. Contributions came from across the portfolio in terms of agencies, geography, client categories, all fueled by the outstanding creativity, insights and digital capabilities that we have throughout Interpublic.
Our success is a reflection of the strength of our offerings and our client-centric focus. Ultimately, it is driven by the caliber of our people. Across the group, we continue to see evidence that Interpublic and our agencies are consistently a first choice for the industry's best talent.
For some time, talent has been a top strategic priority for us, one that has fueled our return to levels of organic growth that are fully competitive or better. We are proud that our culture has become a differentiator for us and has our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, where we have a strong and established track record as the leader in our space.
On our call last quarter, we drilled down and provided greater focus on the role that digital expertise is playing at all of our work that we do for our clients, from advertising through media and marketing services. We pointed out that unlike others in our space, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our disciplines.
This commitment to incubating new skills, developing new products and services and investing in new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. It gives us confidence that our offerings are forward-facing, competitive and increasingly vital to clients as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape.
Operationally, it's clear that we continue to be disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement for the year. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that have been driving further value creation for our shareholders.
As we look to the fourth quarter, the tone of the business is solid. Clients are being measured in their approach, but the year-end period will be key to delivering for all marketers, and they are relying on partners that have the tools, insights and capabilities to connect with consumers across channels and drive desired business outcomes.
We remain cautious on Europe, although our plans did not factor in growth in that region. The Brazilian and Chinese economies have been challenged, although our operations in those regions continue to deliver results.
The new business pipeline is solid. Year-to-date, we continue to be net new business positive and in fact, near the top of the new business league tables.
The significant number of media pictures continue, and it bears noting that we've been performing well to date with a number of headline wins, notably UM's wins of the Coca-Cola media review, J&J's U.S. media buying and planning accounts as well as CVS and McCormick, which was one in collaboration with R/GA.
Those are a reflection of the cutting-edge offerings we have within Mediabrands in terms of strategic media thinkers, outstanding digital and data platforms and the scale and expertise to deliver buying efficiency to some of the world's largest and most demanding clients.
An additional point that is worth repeating when it comes to emerging media is that we do not take ownership of digital media for resale to clients. So our strong organic growth does not reflect the growth of digital media arbitrage revenue that you're seeing among some of our peers who take principal positions and resell owned inventory to clients at a margin. We continue to believe that our role as an agnostic consultant is key and allows us to provide clients with the recommendations and services that are best for their business.
We also remain committed to the highest standard of transparency, an area in which we've been a leader for some time. This continues to gain an importance as the world of digital media is beset by challenges surrounding viewability and other issues that make it imperative that we serve as wholly objective partners to our clients.
McCann continues to post strong performance with outstanding creative work on its major multinationals and notable local market wins in the U.K., Australia and India. We're seeing great collaboration within Worldgroup, and this cross-selling and integration is helping them win new accounts as well as increase their share of wallet with existing clients. The digital and health care units within McCann had strong performance.
In the health care space, it was good to see that McCann Health and FCB Health led us to outstanding performance at the medical marketing and media competition, where we bested the other holding companies in terms of awards won.
Progress at FCB continues. The agency is consistently appearing on pitch list with notable recent wins with Lincoln Financial by the New York office, BMO Harris Bank by the Toronto office, new work from Coke at FCB in South Africa and strong momentum at Inferno FCB in London. FCB Health remains a powerhouse in its field, and the agency's sharper marketing operation, FCB RED, is also a very strong resource.
At CMG, our award-winning public relations, Weber Shandwick and Golin, continue to gain market share. Beyond digital, with both firms have been in the forefront of their discipline, they are also moving into content marketing and upstream to more strategic and integrated opportunities. We are well positioned here, and we are also seeing good progress from our sports and entertainment and experiential businesses as well as continuing improvement in the branding sector.
Focus on Mullen Lowe during the quarter was squarely on merger integration and setting the stage for a successful 2016 and beyond. The agency's senior global leadership recently met to decide on and articulate the network's market position, strategy and brand identity. This will include both agencies' long-standing commitment to creative excellence. Mullen's contemporary hyper-bundled approach and Lowe's deep knowledge of dynamic international markets, it's a combination that's working for many, many leading clients, including Unilever, and we look forward to seeing it build positive momentum in the marketplace.
Our U.S. independents continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Deutsch is an example of the benefits of combining big, creative ideas with a fully integrated suite of digital capabilities. The marketing agency, Hill Holliday and Carmichael Lynch, are other agencies that deliver with this model and provide us with a range of options that commit to needs of domestic clients.
In terms of digital, our offerings are consistently outstanding, whether it be our social media capabilities at Weber and Golin, Cadreon and AMP within Mediabrands or the integrated digital capabilities at all of our brand agencies.
MRM is a top-tier digital network. And the close collaborations we are seeing between them and McCann is elevating the overall Worldgroup offering, just as the integration of Profero and MediaHub are significantly strengthening Mullen Lowe's go-to-market positioning.
We're also fortunate to have R/GA, the undisputed leader in digital and technology-enabled marketing. They continue to win business and awards as well as innovate with programs such as the R/GA Accelerates [ph] that give us a line of sight into terrific start-ups with ideas and technology that will play a role in shaping the future of communications and consumer experience.
Our current accelerator is taking place in Los Angeles in collaboration with the L.A. Dodgers. And the participating companies spend every aspect of connected sport, from athlete training to venue management, to new social channels in which consumers can share their passion for sports.
Huge is another digital specialist that has performed exceptionally well for us. Beyond this industry-leading strategic consulting, design and UX practices, the agency recently made news when it opened a coffee shop in its Atlanta office to serve as a real-time lab in which we will develop and test digital retail innovations to both current and prospective clients.
For us at Interpublic, the new business of advertising means that we encourage ambitious change across the entire organization. By providing access to emerging and transformative technologies, we develop programs that help us attract talent and create work that puts the user experience first, all in the service of our clients.
Looking to the balance of this year, we stayed diligent on costs so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin commitment. There are geographic markets that we will need to monitor. But performance for the first 9 months had been very strong and positions us well for a strong close to the full year.
As mentioned in my initial remarks, we believe that given our performance to date, the appropriate organic revenue growth targets for the new year is in excess of 5%, and that we are on track to deliver 100 basis points of operating margin improvement at the end of our initial target for the year -- at the high end of our initial target.
Moving forward, we're therefore closer to achieving our previously stated goal of 13%. Combined with our company's financial strength and robust return of capital, which have and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and continued support and open the call up for questions."

Look, this -- none of this is by accident. We started on this journey by clearly investing in talent. And I think what you're seeing right now is the fact that the talent that we've embedded within all our organizations is really shining in terms of what clients are looking for in terms of moving the needle with their business. But creative talent and overall talent needs tools and resources within the organization to make sure we can deliver on that. So we've invested in all these tools and resources throughout the company. And finally, we really are a client-centric environment. And so everyone is focusing on the needs of the clients and therefore, we're focusing on what we can bring to the resources within IPG to the client to meet those needs. We're seeing success in our open architecture model, where if you look at the business wins, all of our agencies are aware of the fact that if their particular disciplines need other resources from IPG, they raise their hand and we bring the additional IPG resources to the table. And frankly, we're getting a reputation in the marketplace appropriately that we do this very well, and we really focus on the needs of the clients versus our own silos. And I think the new business wins that we're seeing as well as the embedded growth we're seeing in our existing client base really is indicative of the fact that all the IPG resources are available to move the needle with our client, and we're executing against that. But in the end, it takes people and belief by those people that they have a huge resource base behind them. And the other thing, which I particularly like, is when I participate in a lot of these pitches, what we see in the room are cross disciplines, either from within the agencies or outside IPG. And it's not uncommon for the client to come up to me and say, ""I didn't even realize which individuals work from which discipline,"" and that's really what clients are looking for in their resources. So I'm particularly proud of all our agencies, whether it be our traditional agencies, our digital agencies, our marketing services, PR. I mean, across the board, we're all doing quite well."

And then I go to the next slide, and it's a quote from 1975. So I mean, there are always people out there saying that the competitors and there are other disciplines, whether it be ad tech or smaller agencies. In the end, we have the resources and capabilities that can compete with any resource out there. And frankly, when we don't have it, yes, we use outside parties, we work well with them. It's incumbent upon us to know what we do well and what we don't do well. And that's what this whole concept of open architecture is all about, John. And that is, we're looking at the client first. And if we don't have a resource internally, and when I say internally, I mean within IPG, it's not uncommon for us to use outside resources to help us. And frankly, that's what shows clients that we're thinking of them versus ourselves. And yes, we end up dealing with nontraditional people, whether it be on the ad tech side, even in some of the production -- we don't like it, but even some of the production facilities that clients request us to use. We have to be in a world now where collaboration works. And the collaboration starts with us. And if it's not within our organization, we have to be able to collaborate with other parties that clients are happy with. So we're able to do all of that. And sometimes, working with the third parties turns out to be a lot smoother than sometimes working with ourselves, which is a big shame on us, but that's the reality of the world out there. So the world is changing and our model has to change with us. And I think that's one of the things you're seeing why we're being successful, in that we're not wedded to the silo mentality of the past. We have to collaborate, we have to collaborate within IPG, and we have to collaborate outside of IPG with other parties."

And we look at these things and we see things that appear to be able to be done mechanically, more efficiently. And we kind of worry that maybe that takes some value out of the chain that you would be paid for. I think on the flip side, we can see -- so we see headlines back there. What we often see headlines about are -- what is the traction that you're getting on your skill set in helping clients leverage off these mechanical solutions, right? Like what is the counterbalance to growing fees on integrating these third party and your own party products?

But our job is to work with our clients, okay? It's interesting. I was just talking to our folks on a pitch that we just had this week. And there, we had a presentation on Cadreon and programmatic. Obviously, that's a very strong asset of IPG. It's growing tremendously in -- both in the marketplace and competitively. And yet the client is considering taking that inside. So as part of the pitch, we present ideas and our people from Cadreon present what we're doing, and you see the client sitting there saying, ""Oh my goodness, how come we didn't think of that? How come we didn't think of this?"" So yes, we work with our clients who are intending to bring some of it inside. In the end, we act as integrators, okay? I mean, our job, and I've always said this, confusion is good for us. And the reason it's good for us is we get paid to help make sense out of all of this. And if clients are looking to us to help them do this, we have to be able to respond. And if it means helping them bring it inside, that's okay, but they're still going to need the current thinking and the investments that we make in these tools that clients just aren't in a position to make. And frankly, the talent that we're able to recruit in that environment is so different than to -- the talent that you can recruit internally on a solid basis. So yes, clients are bringing it in. It's not a threat, it's just another tool that clients have, that they want us to work with in the overall integrated offering, and we have to be able to do that. The history of our industry is when clients bring things internally, a lot of times, it comes back. And the reason for it is the ability to recruit talent as well as to keep investing in tools and resources that you need to be current. So yes, it's a phenomena, there's no question about it, and clients are trying to do it internally. But I think they'll find, in the long term, that we still have a role to play here in helping them accomplish what they're looking for, but at the same time, using the tools and resources that we have that they're not capable of developing. So we don't fight it, we actually help them do it. And that's -- again, that's one piece of the puzzle. I mean, again, if this is a relationship with a client, it has to be broad and it has to be seen -- is that we're in a partnership with a client, and we have all these different resources that we bring to the table. And if the client feels comfortable asking us to help them, we don't view it as them taking business away from us. It's part of what our role is, and we have to build it into our model. But it's the reality, but it's been reality for years in this industry, and it just changes the performance."

Just wondering if you could comment on that, the idea that coming out of this process after the set holes [ph] that the total fee envelope available to all of you guys is smaller. And I guess, the other piece of this that doesn't get talked about as much is the situations where the scope of work actually expands. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about the first part. And then what kind of expansion might you see as you get into these reviews, where, who knows, fees could actually go up?"

No, I mean, look, any review that go -- takes place clearly has a view towards what they call efficiency. Efficiencies obviously mean fee reductions. And clients for generations have been looking for more for less. So it's something we're very much used to, and it puts the burden on us to be more efficient, but yet we have to be able to meet the needs of the clients. And yes, that presents problems in terms of us maintaining margin. But again, remember, this is only one piece of the puzzle. When we talk about margins, it's aggregate margins and all the different disciplines and resources. And sure, on some basic contract work that we have on scope, margins may be a little bit less than they may have been before. But in the end, it's our opportunity, and clients expect it for us to be able to bring in new ideas that help them move the needle, and that's what's it's called -- known as out-of-scope work, and out-of-scope work is something that typically we get higher margins on. That's the way our business works and clients know that. But first, they have to start with a line in the sand. So these reviews establish a line in the sand in terms of scope of work and fees that will be available. And we have to work within that model, and it's incumbent upon us to make sure that the additional work that we do. And clients understand that if it's out of scope, they have to pay for it, and we typically make better margins on the out of scope work. That's not a secret in our industry and clients know it. And the other part of it is, this is a value-based environment. And if we can show that we're moving the needle, and clients value the type -- the ideas that we're being to them and the fact that it's in fact proving the results that we believe it can do, clients have incentive fees with us, their performance-based contracts that we have, particularly on the media side of the business. So there are vehicles that we have to develop opportunities for us to enhance margins, and that's the way the business is. And so we don't view procurement as a bad word, we don't view as -- these reviews as necessarily being only with the view towards fee reductions. The other reason these views are taking place is because they want to see if they're getting best-in-class offerings. And frankly, if I was a client, I'd be asking the same thing. So we approach these reviews, even when we're incumbents, as an opportunity to show clients and future clients what we can bring to the table, what resources we have and how we can work differently with them to move the needle. What's interesting is the incumbents usually start out as -- ""Why haven't you brought this to us before?"" So therefore, if you look at the history of reviews, incumbents generally don't do well. But when you really drill down on it, incumbents have been dealing within a certain playbook, both with the client and ourselves. These reviews open up a different playbook, and that means there's got to be change both on the client side as well as our side. And I see that's what's happening in a number of these reviews. Clients are recognizing that their approach isn't necessarily the right approach, and they're willing to think of a different approach that can bring to the table and that means opportunity. Every time we get to work with our clients and show what we can do, it presents opportunities for us across the board. So that's how we approach it."

And so this is nothing that we're afraid of. We've been very clear on rebate issues for 10 years now. It's in all our contracts. We welcome -- in fact, in all these reviews, we have audit capabilities from our clients to come in and review this, so this isn't new for us.

So this isn't really nothing new for our industry. There -- any type of review like this, everyone raises questions on what they're going to find. It's unfortunate that their headlines, particularly in Europe, have made it look like this is a criminal investigation. I -- the last I looked, the ANA doesn't have the ability to subpoena. And if you read these headlines, you would think that, that's what was going on. That's not what's going on. It's a look into the practices within an industry. That's nothing new. This is an industry organization making sure that their constituents are comfortable with what's going on in the practice, and we've been dealing with this all along. So from an IPG perspective, we're very comfortable on rebate transparency, we're very comfortable on contractual transparency, we have it in all our contracts, and verification and review was part of our process.

Look, we already have some very talented people within IPG who work on these multinational open architecture client situations where they're working with the units themselves, whether it be FCB, whether it be McCann, whether it be Lowe. And it's their responsibility to work with the people within these agencies to make sure that the needs of the clients are being met with all the resources of IPG. We were fortunate to have an opportunity to recruit Simon to our organization. And clearly, his responsibility will be both on the new business side, but also on these open architecture pitches. More and more, these are fees that are coming into the holding company. They're coming directly to me actually and sometimes -- yes, which is why I have to look at my e-mails everyday. But it really comes in to the holding company and they're saying, ""You tell us what is the best way you want to approach this RFP."" So someone like Simon, with his vast experience in new business and client focus and frankly, his knowledge of the consulting industry and the previous [ph] relationships he has is a tremendous asset for us. And frankly, Simon has already been involved with a number of our agencies, pitches that are going on right now, and he's a resource. And we're from the home office and we're here to help. And some of our agencies have already tapped into Simon to help him in terms of their pitch. He's fantastic in terms of new business pitches, and he's actually gone in and help these agencies. And frankly, we had a couple of wins that he helped in terms of the presentations. So he's -- the fact that we're able to recruit Simon is an indication to me that this whole notion of open architecture is one that is resonating in the industry, and our reputation for being a holding company that collaborates with all the agencies within the holding company is real. And I think his presence, along with the other individuals within IPG, whether it be Peter or Terry, they all work very closely with our agencies. And they know that they are there to be helpful to our agencies. The pitches themselves are coming in different forms, and we have to be able to respond to the needs of the clients. Did Simon ask you to raise that question?"

So we're feeling pretty positive about that. Look, we're a variable cost model. Our biggest variable cost is SRS. We've -- it's not a secret. We said what we have to do is focus on that. And you can focus on that by generating revenue, which is what we've been doing and keeping an eye on those -- on the cost pressures and the SRS. So we've done a great job in O&G, and that's -- it's showing the improvement even in the third quarter. We see an improvement there. We've seen leverage, we've seen at least 50 basis points. And if you worked through the pass-throughs, it's really 80 basis points this quarter in terms of leverage on SRS. So we're very focused on it and we just have to continue to do that.

So this isn't rocket science, this business, and we're very comfortable in our ability to manage that. I think we've proven that we know how to manage that. We can do this. And I've said this before, we can get there tomorrow, but part of this is making sure we have the talent and resources to generate growth. So on a longer-term basis, had we not had the talent and resources there we have within all our different agencies, we wouldn't be delivering the results that you're seeing right now. So if we starve the pipeline of people and got to our SRS ratios in line quicker, yes, we may achieve our goal, but our long-term viability would be adversely affected. I kind of like the way we're doing it now. If you're looking at 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement, add clips along the way, we're going to get there. We just don't -- we're not going to get there tomorrow. And it would be silly for us to shoot ourselves in the foot and then do something dramatic that would get us there. Just look at the write-off that we're having. We're focusing on unprofitable businesses that are in geographic locations that aren't necessary, that are a drag on our P&L. And so this time, the $38 million, it's 4 to 5 locations in areas that we don't have to be, they were dilutive. And we either sold them or closed them, and that's how we get there. We're constantly looking at those types of opportunities."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by Q&A.
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue and profit growth. Organic revenue growth in our third quarter was 7.1%, on top of the very strong comps from a year ago. 
Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 10 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.9%. However, FX had very little impact on our operating margin. Total revenue growth was 1.3%. We continue to see positive contributions to our top line performance from a broad range of our creative, media and marketing services offerings.
Across the group, our digital capabilities were again significant drivers of growth. We also continue to drive strong growth in our largest regional markets, with the U.S., Asia Pac and U.K. all showing very good advances. Organic growth in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter.
In the standpoint of client sectors, we saw a growth across all client verticals. The best performance came in tech and telecom, financial services, food and beverage and health care. Our operating profit in the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 12% from a year ago. Q3 operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 10.3%. We had leverage on both our salaries and related and office and general expenses.
Worth noting that below operating profit, other expenses in the quarter includes charges totaling $38 million to dispose of certain smaller business units which were underperforming and which we deemed as nonstrategic, all of which were outside the U.S. Most of the expense was noncash. Frank will have more color in his comments.
The after-tax expense was $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.08 for the 9 months. Excluding the charge of the disposition, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.27, an increase of 29% compared to the period -- prior period.
Looking at the first 9 months. Organic revenue growth was 6.5% on top of 5.9% a year ago. We posted a 17% increase to operating profit and a 34% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. This represents industry-leading organic revenue growth and profit growth. That's an accomplishment which all our people across the company can be proud of.
Turning back to a bit more detail on the quarter. U.S. organic growth was 7.1% on top of 7.9% a year ago, which is an outstanding result. We had growth at most of our agencies, notably McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Deutsch, R/GA, Weber Shandwick and Golin. International growth was 7.1%, once again driven by our full range of services.
By region, we were led by 14.4% growth in LatAm, where we saw increases in most national markets. Asia Pac increased 7.2% organically and was highlighted by our continuing strong trends in India and China.
In the U.K., organic growth was 5.2%, on top of last year's 12% growth. We were led by the growth of R/GA and our marketing services specialist at CMG. In Continental Europe, Q3 organic growth was essentially flat, and we continue to stay focused on improving our talent and capabilities in this region.
The first 9 months, 6.5% organic growth reflected growth in every region of the world and contributions across all major disciplines. 9 months operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses.
As we said previously, supporting our best-in-class offerings as well as cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be our top priorities, and we are successfully executing against those objectives.
With respect to share repurchase, during Q3, we used $70 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares. Through 9 months, we've utilized approximately $172 million for share repurchases, and we have $271 million remaining on our authorization as of September 30.
Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our dilutive share count by 26%.
In sum, our performance in the quarter and year-to-date continues to demonstrate industry leadership and the strong position of our offerings.
Heading into our important fourth quarter, economic conditions in some areas of the world will present macro headwinds and uncertainties. While those have been incorporated into our outlook, the overall tone of business nonetheless remains solid, and we continue to effectively manage expenses.
Previously, we increased our full year and 2015 organic growth target to 4% to 5%. Our strong performance through 9 months has us on track to exceed 5%. We also remain well positioned to achieve 100 basis points of margin expansion this year, the high end of our targeted range.
With that overview, I'll turn it to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Organic growth was 7.1% in the third quarter, evenly balanced between the U.S. and international. In our first 9 months, organic revenue growth was 6.5%.
Q3 operating profit was $192 million, an increase of 12%. In the first 9 months, operating profit grew 17%. Q3 margin of 10.3% improved 100 basis points, and our margin for the 9 months also improved 100 basis points.
We had a below-the-line charge of $38 million for the disposition of selected non-U.S. business units. Most of the charge is the balance sheet write-off of currency translation adjustments built up over the years, with the balance representing the net assets of the disposed businesses.
This pertains to a handful of business for which revenue was small, with noncash translation adjustments magnified by large FX changes over the years. The impact of this charge to reported diluted EPS was $0.09 for the quarter.
Including the charge, diluted EPS was $0.27, which compares to Q3 2014 at $0.21, a 29% increase. Q3 fully diluted shares decreased 3% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. I've already covered the disposition-related charge and other expenses.
Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.87 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q3 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was a negative 5.9%, with the dollar significantly stronger in all regions of the world. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 7.1%.
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 8%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB, by Mediabrands, Deutsch and by R/GA. IAN's growth was 7.5% over the first 9 months.
At our CMG segment, Q3 organic growth was 3.7%. We continue to have very strong growth at our PR agencies, notably Weber Shandwick and Golin, which grew at double-digit rates. Organic growth was 2.5% at CMG for the first 9 months, but was [ph] mid-single digit increase, excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was outstanding at 7.1%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of agencies, disciplines and client sectors. For the 9 months, organic growth was 7%.
In the U.K., Q3 organic growth was 5.2%, on top of 12.2% last year. We had notably strong performance at R/GA, McCann, Octagon and Weber Shandwick. For the 9 months, organic growth was 6.5%.
Continental Europe is essentially flat organically in Q3. Our largest markets in the continent were mixed with Spain up organically, Italy and France flat and Germany down.
In Asia Pac, our largest international region, Q3 organic growth was 7.2%, propelled by strong growth in China and India. Growth for the 9 months was 8.4%, a performance that speaks to the strength of our positioning across our global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings.
In LatAm, our organic increase was 14.4% in the quarter. We continue to see a very strong performance in most national markets such as Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, which is consistent with the first half of the year. We also had improved quarter in Brazil, although business conditions generally remained challenging there. In the quarter, we had leading contributions to growth in the region by McCann, Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge.
Our Other Markets group, which made up of Canada and the Middle East and Africa, grew 13.5% organically in the quarter due chiefly to strong performance in the Middle East as well as growth in Canada.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 20 basis points from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. As a result, margin expanded 100 basis points.
Underneath that performance, our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue in the quarter was 64.4% this year, an improvement of 50 basis points from a year ago. We had 50 basis points of leverage in our base payroll, benefits and tax expense as well as 20 points -- basis points on temporary labor. Our accrual for incentives increased by 40 basis points as a percent of revenue, driven by our strong operating performance.
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 48,700, an increase of 3.2% year-on-year. The increase chiefly reflects organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, health care and PR as well as regionally in the U.S., U.K. and Asia Pac.
Turning to ops and general expenses on the lower half of this slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with 25.8% a year ago, an improvement of 50 basis points. Our improvement was driven by leverage on expenses for occupancy, travel, office supplies and telecom and all other O&G expense.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.1%.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the third quarter with $881 million cash and short-term marketable securities. Comparison to December 31 reflects our cash level as seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
On Slide 10, we turn to our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $281 million compared with $176 million a year ago. Working capital is a source of $140 million -- $154 million this year compared with the use of $11 million in Q3 2014.
Investing activities used $41 million in the quarter, primarily for CapEx. Financing activities used $151 million, mainly in capital returned to shareholders, $70 million for share repurchases and $48 million for common stock dividends. Our net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $26 million.
On Slide 11, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.75 billion at the most recent quarter end.
In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter and the year-to-date represents very solid performance and progress for meeting our financial objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost discipline and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that said, let me turn it back to Michael."

In terms of organic revenue growth and margin progress, Q3 continues to make us a leader in our peer group. Contributions came from across the portfolio in terms of agencies, geography, client categories, all fueled by the outstanding creativity, insights and digital capabilities that we have throughout Interpublic.
Our success is a reflection of the strength of our offerings and our client-centric focus. Ultimately, it is driven by the caliber of our people. Across the group, we continue to see evidence that Interpublic and our agencies are consistently a first choice for the industry's best talent.
For some time, talent has been a top strategic priority for us, one that has fueled our return to levels of organic growth that are fully competitive or better. We are proud that our culture has become a differentiator for us and has our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, where we have a strong and established track record as the leader in our space.
On our call last quarter, we drilled down and provided greater focus on the role digital expertise is playing in all of our work we do for our clients, from advertising through media and marketing services. We pointed out that unlike others in our space, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our disciplines.
This commitment to incubating new skills, developing new products and services and investing in new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. It gives us confidence that our offerings are forward-facing, competitive and increasingly vital to clients as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape.
Operationally, it's clear that we continue to be disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement for the year. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that have been driving further value creation for our shareholders.
As we look to the fourth quarter, the tone of the business is solid. Clients are being measured in their approach, but the year-end period will be key to delivering for all marketers, and they are relying on partners that have the tools, insights and capabilities to connect with consumers across channels and drive desired business outcomes.
We remain cautious on Europe, although our plans did not factor in growth in that region. The Brazilian and Chinese economies have been challenged, although our operations in those regions continue to deliver results.
The new business pipeline is solid. Year-to-date, we continue to be net new business positive and in fact, near the top of the new business league tables.
The significant number of media pitches continue, and it bears noting that we've been performing well to date with a number of headline wins, notably UM's wins of the Coca-Cola media review, J&J's U.S. media buying and planning accounts, as well as CVS and McCormick, which was won in collaboration with R/GA.
Those are a reflection of the cutting-edge offerings we have within Mediabrands in terms of strategic media thinkers, outstanding digital and data platforms and the scale and expertise to deliver buying efficiency to some of the world's largest and most demanding clients.
An additional point that is worth repeating when it comes to emerging media is that we do not take ownership of digital media for resale to clients. So our strong organic growth does not reflect the growth of digital media arbitrage revenue that you're seeing among some of our peers who take principal positions and resell owned inventory to clients at a margin. We continue to believe that our role as an agnostic consultant is key and allows us to provide clients with the recommendations and services that are best for their business.
We also remain committed to the highest standard of transparency, an area in which we've been a leader for some time. This continues to gain in importance as the world of digital media is beset by challenges surrounding viewability and other issues that make it imperative that we serve as wholly objective partners to our clients.
McCann continues to post strong performance with outstanding creative work on its major multinationals and notable local market wins in the U.K., Australia and India. We're seeing great collaboration within Worldgroup, and this cross-selling and integration is helping them win new accounts as well as increase their share of wallet with existing clients. The digital and health care units within McCann had strong performance.
In the health care space, it was good to see that McCann Health and FCB Health led us to outstanding performance at the medical marketing and media competition, where we bested the other holding companies in terms of awards won.
Progress at FCB continues. The agency is consistently appearing on pitch lists with notable recent wins with Lincoln Financial by the New York office, BMO Harris Bank by the Toronto office, new work from Coke at FCB in South Africa and strong momentum at Inferno FCB in London. FCB Health remains a powerhouse in its field, and the agency's shopper marketing operation, FCB RED, is also a very strong resource.
At CMG, our award-winning public relations, Weber Shandwick and Golin, continue to gain market share. Beyond digital, where both firms have been in the forefront of their discipline, they are also moving into content marketing and upstream to more strategic and integrated opportunities. We are well positioned here, and we are also seeing good progress from our sports and entertainment and experiential businesses as well as continuing improvement in the branding sector.
Focus on Mullen Lowe during the quarter was squarely on merger integration and setting the stage for a successful 2016 and beyond. The agency's senior global leadership recently met to decide on and articulate the network's market position, strategy and brand identity. This will include both agencies' long-standing commitment to creative excellence: Mullen's contemporary hyper-bundled approach and Lowe's deep knowledge of dynamic international markets. It's a combination that's working for many, many leading clients, including Unilever, and we look forward to seeing it build positive momentum in the marketplace.
Our U.S. independents continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Deutsch is an example of the benefits of combining big, creative ideas with a fully integrated suite of digital capabilities. The marketing agency, Hill Holliday and Carmichael Lynch, are other agencies that deliver with this model and provide us with a range of options that can meet the needs of domestic clients.
In terms of digital, our offerings are consistently outstanding, whether it be our social media capabilities at Weber and Golin, Cadreon and AMP within Mediabrands or the integrated digital capabilities at all of our brand agencies.
MRM is a top-tier digital network. And the close collaborations we are seeing between them and McCann is elevating the overall Worldgroup offering, just as the integration of Profero and Mediahub are significantly strengthening Mullen Lowe's go-to-market positioning.
We're also fortunate to have R/GA, the undisputed leader in digital and technology-enabled marketing. They continue to win business and awards as well as innovate with programs such as the R/GA Accelerators that give us a line of sight into terrific start-ups with ideas and technology that will play a role in shaping the future of communications and consumer experience.
Our current accelerator is taking place in Los Angeles in collaboration with the L.A. Dodgers. And the participating companies span every aspect of connected sport, from athlete training to venue management, to new social channels on which consumers can share their passion for sports.
Huge is another digital specialist that has performed exceptionally well for us. Beyond its industry-leading strategic consulting, design and UX practices, the agency recently made news when it opened a coffee shop in its Atlanta office to serve as a real-time lab in which we will develop and test digital retail innovations to both current and prospective clients.
For us at Interpublic, the new business of advertising means that we encourage ambitious change across the entire organization. By providing access to emerging and transformative technologies, we develop programs that help us attract talent and create work that puts the user experience first, all in the service of our clients.
Looking to the balance of this year, we stay viligant (sic) [vigilant] on costs so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin commitment. There are geographic markets that we will need to monitor. But performance for the first 9 months has been very strong and positions us well for a strong close to the full year.
As mentioned in my initial remarks, we believe that given our performance to date, the appropriate organic revenue growth targets for the new year is in excess of 5%, and that we are on track to deliver 100 basis points of operating margin improvement at the end of our initial target for the year -- at the high end of our initial target.
Moving forward, we're therefore closer to achieving our previously stated goal of 13%. Combined with our company's financial strength and robust return of capital, which have and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and continued support and open the call up for questions."

Look, this -- none of this is by accident. We started on this journey by clearly investing in talent. And I think what you're seeing right now is the fact that the talent that we've embedded within all our organizations is really shining in terms of what clients are looking for in terms of moving the needle with their business. But creative talent and overall talent needs tools and resources within the organization to make sure we can deliver on that. So we've invested in all these tools and resources throughout the company. And finally, we really are a client-centric environment. And so everyone is focusing on the needs of the clients and therefore, we're focusing on what we can bring to the resources within IPG to the client to meet those needs. We're seeing success in our open architecture model, where if you look at the business wins, all of our agencies are aware of the fact that if their particular disciplines need other resources from IPG, they raise their hand and we bring the additional IPG resources to the table. And frankly, we're getting a reputation in the marketplace, appropriately, that we do this very well, and we really focus on the needs of the clients versus our own silos. And I think the new business wins that we're seeing as well as the embedded growth we're seeing in our existing client base really is indicative of the fact that all the IPG resources are available to move the needle with our client, and we're executing against that. But in the end, it takes people and belief by those people that they have a huge resource base behind them. And the other thing, which I particularly like, is when I participate in a lot of these pitches, what we see in the room are cross-disciplines, either from within the agencies or outside IPG. And it's not uncommon for the client to come up to me and say, ""I didn't even realize which individuals were from which discipline,"" and that's really what clients are looking for in their resources. So I'm particularly proud of all our agencies, whether it be our traditional agencies, our digital agencies, our marketing services, PR. I mean, across the board, we're all doing quite well."

And then I go to the next slide, and it's a quote from 1975. So I mean, there are always people out there saying that the competitors and there are other disciplines, whether it be ad tech or smaller agencies. In the end, we have the resources and capabilities that can compete with any resource out there. And frankly, when we don't have it, yes, we use outside parties, we work well with them. It's incumbent upon us to know what we do well and what we don't do well. And that's what this whole concept of open architecture is all about, John. And that is, we're looking at the client first. And if we don't have a resource internally, and when I say internally, I mean within IPG, it's not uncommon for us to use outside resources to help us. And frankly, that's what shows clients that we're thinking of them versus ourselves. And yes, we end up dealing with nontraditional people, whether it be on the ad tech side, even in some of the production -- we don't like it, but even some of the production facilities that clients request us to use. We have to be in a world now where collaboration works. And the collaboration starts with us. And if it's not within our organization, we have to be able to collaborate with other parties that clients are happy with. So we're able to do all of that. And sometimes, working with the third parties turns out to be a lot smoother than sometimes working with ourselves, which is a big shame on us, but that's the reality of the world out there. So the world is changing and our model has to change with us. And I think that's one of the things you're seeing why we're being successful, in that we're not wedded to the silo mentality of the past. We have to collaborate, we have to collaborate within IPG, and we have to collaborate outside of IPG with other parties."

And we kind of worry that maybe that takes some value out of the chain that you would be paid for. I think on the flip side, we can see -- so we see headlines about that.

But our job is to work with our clients, okay? It's interesting. I was just talking to our folks on a pitch that we just had this week. And there, we had a presentation on Cadreon and programmatic. Obviously, that's a very strong asset of IPG. It's growing tremendously in -- both in the marketplace and competitively. And yet the client is considering taking that inside. So as part of the pitch, we present ideas and our people from Cadreon present what we're doing, and you see the client sitting there saying, ""Oh my goodness, how come we didn't think of that? How come we didn't think of this?"" So yes, we work with our clients who are intending to bring some of it inside. In the end, we act as integrators, okay? I mean, our job, and I've always said this, confusion is good for us. And the reason it's good for us is we get paid to help make sense out of all of this. And if clients are looking to us to help them do this, we have to be able to respond. And if it means helping them bring it inside, that's okay, but they're still going to need the current thinking and the investments that we make in these tools that clients just aren't in a position to make. And frankly, the talent that we're able to recruit in that environment is so different than to -- the talent that you can recruit internally on a siloed basis. So yes, clients are bringing it in. It's not a threat, it's just another tool that clients have, that they want us to work with in the overall integrated offering, and we have to be able to do that. The history of our industry is when clients bring things internally, a lot of times, it comes back. And the reason for it is the ability to recruit talent as well as to keep investing in tools and resources that you need to be current. So yes, it's a phenomena, there's no question about it, and clients are trying to do it internally. But I think they'll find, in the long term, that we still have a role to play here in helping them accomplish what they're looking for, but at the same time, using the tools and resources that we have that they're not capable of developing. So we don't fight it, we actually help them do it. And that's -- again, that's one piece of the puzzle. I mean, again, if there's a relationship with a client it has to be broad and it has to be seen as that we're in a partnership with the client, and we have all these different resources that we bring to the table. And if the client feels comfortable asking us to help them, we don't view it as them taking business away from us. It's part of what our role is, and we have to build it into our model. But it's the reality, but it's been reality for years in this industry, and it just changes different forms."

So with regard to the reviews, we see headlines out there sometimes from large clients suggesting that they're going to use the review process to drive down their aggregate fees, right? Just wondering if you could comment on that: the idea that coming out of this process, as the dust settles, that the total fee envelope available to all of you guys is smaller. And I guess, the other piece of this that doesn't get talked about as much is the situations where the scope of work actually expands. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about the first part. And then what kind of expansion might you see as you get into these reviews, where, who knows, fees could actually go up?"

No, I mean, look, any review that go -- takes place clearly has a view towards what they call efficiency. Efficiencies obviously means fee reductions.

No, I mean, look, any review that go -- takes place clearly has a view towards what they call efficiency. Efficiencies obviously means fee reductions. And clients for generations have been looking for more for less. So it's something we're very much used to, and it puts the burden on us to be more efficient, but yet we have to be able to meet the needs of the clients. And yes, that presents problems in terms of us maintaining margin. But again, remember, this is only one piece of the puzzle. When we talk about margins, it's aggregate margins in all the different disciplines and resources. And sure, on some basic contract work that we have on scope, margins may be a little bit less than they may have been before. But in the end, it's our opportunity, and clients expect it for us to be able to bring in new ideas that help them move the needle, and that's what is ""known as out-of-scope work,"" and out-of-scope work is something that typically we get higher margins on. That's the way our business works and clients know that. But first, they have to start with a line in the sand. So these reviews establish a line in the sand in terms of scope of work and fees that will be available. And we have to work within that model, and it's incumbent upon us to make sure that the additional work that we do -- and clients understand that if it's out of scope, they have to pay for it, and we typically make better margins on the out-of-scope work. That's not a secret in our industry and clients know it. And the other part of it is, this is a value-based environment. And if we can show that we're moving the needle, and clients value the type -- the ideas that we're bringing to them and the fact that it's in fact proving the results that we believe it can do, clients have incentive fees with us, there are performance-based contracts that we have, particularly on the media side of the business. So there are vehicles that we have to develop opportunities for us to enhance margins, and that's the way the business is. And so we don't view procurement as a bad word, we don't view as -- these reviews as necessarily being only with a view towards fee reductions. The other reason these views are taking place is because they want to see if they're getting best-in-class offerings. And frankly, if I was a client, I'd be asking the same thing. So we approach these reviews, even when we're incumbents, as an opportunity to show clients and future clients what we can bring to the table, what resources we have and how we can work differently with them to move the needle. What's interesting is the incumbents usually start out as -- ""Why haven't you brought this to us before?"" So therefore, if you look at the history of reviews, incumbents generally don't do well. But when you really drill down on it, incumbents have been dealing within a certain playbook, both with the client and ourselves. These reviews open up a different playbook, and that means there's got to be change both on the client side as well as our side. And I see that's what's happening in a number of these reviews. Clients are recognizing that their approach isn't necessarily the right approach, and they're willing to think of a different approach that can bring to the table and that means opportunity. Every time we get to work with our clients and show what we can do, it presents opportunities for us across the board. So that's how we approach it."

The ANA has been talking about this, the 4As has been talking about it. Everybody's been talking about it. So the fact that the ANA hired 2 firms to do it, to help them with it, is not a surprise to us at all. Obviously, we've dealt with these firms before, not so much the Krolls as much as the other one. But no, we've been talking about transparency. It started with us, frankly, 10 years ago, maybe it's 11 now, time flies when you're having a good time, on this whole issue of rebates. And so this is nothing that we're afraid of. We've been very clear on rebate issues for 10 years now. It's in all our contracts. We welcome -- in fact, in all these reviews, we have audit capabilities from our clients to come in and review this, so this isn't new for us. And as part of the verification and audit that we have within our own systems, clients are welcome to come in and in fact, we do share with them results from that and some of the -- and one of the firms that are doing this, actually, we worked with in the past. So this isn't -- really nothing new for our industry. There -- any type of review like this, everyone raises questions on what they're going to find. It's unfortunate that the headlines, particularly in Europe, have made it look like this is a criminal investigation. The last I looked, the ANA doesn't have the ability to subpoena. And if you read these headlines, you would think that that's what was going on. That's not what's going on. It's a look into the practices within an industry. That's nothing new. This is an industry organization making sure that their constituents are comfortable with what's going on in the practice, and we've been dealing with this all along. So from an IPG perspective, we're very comfortable on rebate transparency, we're very comfortable on contractual transparency, we have it in all our contracts, and verification and review is part of our process. So there's nothing in any of that, that concerns us."

We were fortunate to have an opportunity to recruit Simon to our organization. And clearly, his responsibility will be both on the new business side, but also on these open-architecture pitches. More and more, these RFPs are coming into the holding company. They're coming directly to me, actually, and sometimes -- yes, which is why I have to look at my emails every day. But it really comes in to the holding company and they're saying, ""You tell us which is the best way you want to approach this RFP."" So someone like Simon, with his vast experience in new business and client focus and, frankly, his knowledge of the consulting industry and the -- relationships he has is a tremendous asset for us. And frankly, Simon has already been involved with a number of our agencies' pitches that are going on right now, and he's a resource. And we're from the home office and we're here to help. And some of our agencies have already tapped into Simon to help him in terms of their pitch. He's fantastic in terms of new business pitches, and he's actually gone in and helped these agencies. And frankly, we had a couple of wins that he helped in terms of the presentations. So he's -- the fact that we were able to recruit Simon is an indication to me that this whole notion of open architecture is one that is resonating in the industry, and our reputation for being a holding company that collaborates with all the agencies within the holding company is real. And I think his presence, along with the other individuals within IPG, whether it be Peter or Terry, they all work very closely with our agencies.

So we're feeling pretty positive about that. Look, we're a variable cost model. Our biggest variable cost is SRS. We've -- it's not a secret. We said what we have to do is focus on that. And you can focus on that by generating revenue, which is what we've been doing, and keeping an eye on those -- on the cost pressures and the SRS. So we've done a great job on O&G, and that's -- it's showing the improvement even in the third quarter. We see an improvement there. We've seen leverage, we've seen at least 50 basis points. And if you worked through the pass-throughs, it's really 80 basis points this quarter in terms of leverage on SRS. So we're very focused on it and we just have to continue to do that.

So this isn't rocket science, this business, and we're very comfortable in our ability to manage that. I think we've proven that we know how to manage that. We can do this. And I've said this before, we can get there tomorrow, but part of this is making sure we have the talent and resources to generate growth. So on a longer-term basis, had we not had the talent and resources that we had within all our different agencies, we wouldn't be delivering the results that you're seeing right now. So if we starved the pipeline of people and got our SRS ratios in line quicker, yes, we may achieve our goal, but our long-term viability would be adversely affected. I kind of like the way we're doing it now. If you're looking at 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement at clips along the way, we're going to get there. We just don't -- we're not going to get there tomorrow. And it would be silly for us to shoot ourselves in the foot and do something dramatic that would get us there. Just look at the write-off that we're having. We're focusing on unprofitable businesses that are in geographic locations that aren't necessary, that are a drag on our P&L. And so this time, the $38 million, it's 4 to 5 locations in areas that we don't have to be, they were dilutive. And we either sold them or closed them, and that's how we get there.
