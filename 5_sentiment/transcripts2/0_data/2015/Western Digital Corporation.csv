The non-GAAP forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related with acquisitions of HGST, sTec, VeloBit and Virident and employee termination, litigation and other charges. Because we cannot fully quality future amounts for those excluded items, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable non-GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter.
I am pleased with our financial results in the December quarter. We achieved strong revenue, gross margin and earnings performance. We also generated significant cash flow from operations in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Seagate arbitration award.
The diversified nature of our business, together with ongoing secular growth in data and crisp execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, continue to enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance. Market dynamics in the December quarter were in line with our expectations.
In our business, we some a particular strength in demand for capacity enterprise and video surveillance hard drives and for Enterprise SSDs. As anticipated, there was a seasonal demand objects for branded products.
We expect ongoing hyperscale cloud deployments, coupled with our expanding product portfolio and customer engagement model, to continue fueling our growth and capacity enterprise for the foreseeable future. Petabyte growth by category is expected to remain strong. Our flash platform solutions business, which includes our expanding portfolio of enterprise class SSDs, maintained its growth trajectory in the quarter, delivering revenue of $187 million.
The demand outlook for the March quarter reflects a normal seasonal decline with moderation in clients, branded products and performance enterprise with stable demand and capacity enterprise. We believe overall supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced.
I continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stabilization of the PC market where demand has been in line with our expectations. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the market's response to our strategic growth initiatives, which we believe position the company to thrive in the evolving data storage ecosystem.
We have strengthened our value proposition by enhancing our technical expertise, expanding our product portfolio and investing in our go-to-market capabilities. We will continue to prudently evaluate investment opportunities to advance these initiatives.
We gained traction in key markets during the December quarter. Our broad lineup of high-capacity hard drives, including those based on our proprietary Helio C platform continued to be embraced by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale data customer -- data center customers. We continue to invest in high-growth vertical market applications. Specifically, we have seen strong customer acceptance of our WD purple hard drives in the security surveillance market. We launched a 6-terabyte modeling during the December quarter that has been well-received by customers. We expect strong ongoing growth in this space, given the rapid adoption of digital video cameras and security surveillance systems worldwide.
There continues to be strong growth momentum and branded with our portfolio of My Cloud solutions addressing both the consumer and prosumer markets. The My Cloud software and apps have now been downloaded by more than 4 million users worldwide.
We are engaged with customers and partners on our recently announced active archive platform. Proof-of-concept systems are up and running and initial customer feedback has been positive. This new category of storage solution will feature high-density peta scale capacity in a single rack and deliver entirely new levels of storage efficiency and value. And as a reminder, we expect revenue growth from our flash platform's business to outpace that of the industry.
Before turning it over to Olivier, I would like thank and recognize our employees worldwide for helping to deliver a strong second quarter. Our consistent financial performance is a testament to the strength of our team, well-diversified business, leading products and the customer-centric engagement model. Olivier?"

We expect seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the December quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the time implied in our guidance, provided in October. In our business, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise, the anticipated seasonal increase in branded products, as well as continued steady demand in performance enterprise.
Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products will remain within our 4- to 6-week range. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $187 million in revenue related to our flash platform solutions group.
We shipped a total of 61 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall LSV was driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance, along with the seasonal improvement in client and branded products.
Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%, which is better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $55 million of amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring charges.
Operating expenses totaled $644 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $620 million, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the flawed insurance recovery. Expenses were higher than our implied guidance due to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights.
Stocks expensed for the December quarter was $20 million or 4% of pretax income. The tax rate reflects the reflective extension of the U.S. Federal R&D Tax Credit that was signed into law during the December quarter.
Our net income totaled $460 million or $1.93 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. This includes the $0.07 per share tax benefit from the R&D tax credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. In the December quarter, we generated $243 million in cash from operations and a free cash flow -- and our free cash flow totaled $97 million. As a reminder, we paid a total of $773 million related to an arbitration award in the December quarter.
Our CapEx totaled $146 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $309 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.
We've closed Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion of which, approximately $1.4 billion was held in the U.S.
I will now provide guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 million; gross margin percentage roughly flat with our Q2 performance, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $610 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the tax rate of approximately 7.5% and the share count of approximately 237 million.
Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.90 and $2.00 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

We'll  obviously update our expectations for that as we move through the quarter. And then obviously, as we move through the back half of the calendar year, where we get help from a seasonality perspective, we would expect to see that TAM increase from there."

Also the things that we're investing in, these strategic growth initiatives, generally speaking, carry higher margins. Right now, 58% of our business is quote on PC. And we know and we've said this in the past that the PC market is more price sensitive and there's visibility to differentiate and accordingly those products, carry lower margin profiles. But as our revenue increases in the non-PC segment, generally carrying higher margins, we have a bias over time for our gross margins increasing as opposed to decreasing over time. That being said, we continue to have a stated gross margin range of 27 and 32. But as these things continue to evolve, we'll look at whether we need to reevaluate that gross margin range."

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter.
I am pleased with our financial results in the December quarter. We achieved strong revenue, gross margin and earnings performance. We also generated significant cash flow from operations in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Seagate arbitration award.
The diversified nature of our business, together with ongoing secular growth in data and crisp execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, continued to enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance. Market dynamics in the December quarter were in line with our expectations.
In our business, we saw a particular strength in demand for capacity enterprise and video surveillance hard drives and for Enterprise SSDs. As anticipated, there was a seasonal demand uptick for branded products.
We expect ongoing hyperscale cloud deployments, coupled with our expanding product portfolio and customer engagement model, to continue fueling our growth and capacity enterprise for the foreseeable future. Petabyte growth in this category is expected to remain strong. Our Flash Platform Solutions business, which includes our expanding portfolio of enterprise class SSDs, maintained its growth trajectory in the quarter, delivering revenue of $187 million.
The demand outlook for the March quarter reflects a normal seasonal decline with moderation in client, branded products and performance enterprise with stable demand in capacity enterprise. We believe overall supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced.
I continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stabilization of the PC market where demand has been in line with our expectations. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the market's response to our strategic growth initiatives, which we believe position the company to thrive in the evolving data storage ecosystem.
We have strengthened our value proposition by enhancing our technical expertise, expanding our product portfolio and investing in our go-to-market capabilities. We will continue to prudently evaluate investment opportunities to advance these initiatives.
We gained traction in key markets during the December quarter. Our broad lineup of high-capacity hard drives, including those based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform continued to be embraced by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale data center customers. We continue to invest in high-growth vertical market applications. Specifically, we have seen strong customer acceptance of our WD Purple hard drives in the security surveillance market. We launched the 6-terabyte model in the December quarter that has been well received by customers. We expect strong ongoing growth in this space, given the rapid adoption of digital video cameras and security surveillance systems worldwide.
There continues to be strong growth momentum in branded with our portfolio of My Cloud solutions addressing both the consumer and prosumer markets. The My Cloud software and apps have now been downloaded by more than 4 million users worldwide.
We are engaged with customers and partners on our recently announced Active Archive platform. Proof-of-concept systems are up and running, and initial customer feedback has been positive. This new category of storage solution will feature high-density petascale capacities in a single rack, and deliver entirely new levels of storage efficiency and value. And as a reminder, we expect revenue growth from our Flash Platform's business to outpace that of the industry.
Before turning it over to Olivier, I would like thank and recognize our employees worldwide for helping to deliver a strong second quarter. Our consistent financial performance is a testament to the strength of our team, a well-diversified business, leading products and a customer-centric engagement model. Olivier?"

Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the December quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in October. In our business, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise, the anticipated seasonal increase in branded products as well as continued steady demand in performance enterprise.
Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain within our 4- to 6-week range. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $187 million in revenue related to our Flash Platform Solutions group.
We shipped a total of 61 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall LSP was driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance, along with the seasonal improvement in client and branded products.
Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%, which is better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $55 million of amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring charges.
Operating expenses totaled $644 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $620 million, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the flood insurance recovery. Expenses were higher than our implied guidance due to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights.
Tax expense for the December quarter was $20 million or 4% of pretax income. The tax rate reflects the retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter.
Our net income totaled $460 million or $1.93 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. This includes the $0.07 per share tax benefit from the R&D tax credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. In the December quarter, we generated $243 million in cash from operations and a free cash flow -- and our free cash flow totaled $97 million. As a reminder, we paid a total of $773 million related to an arbitration award in the December quarter.
Our CapEx totaled $146 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $309 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.
We closed Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was held in the U.S.
I will now provide guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion; gross margin percentage roughly flat with our Q2 performance, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $610 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the tax rate of approximately 7.5%; and the share count of approximately 237 million.
Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.90 and $2.00 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

And we know and we've said this in the past that the PC market is more price sensitive and there's less ability to differentiate, and accordingly those products, carry lower margin profiles. But as our revenue increases in the non-PC segment, generally carrying higher margins, we have a bias over time for our gross margins increasing as opposed to decreasing over time. That being said, we continue to have a stated gross margin range of 27% and 32%. But as these things continue to evolve, we'll look at whether or not we need to reevaluate that gross margin range."

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter.
I am pleased with our financial results in the December quarter. We achieved strong revenue, gross margin and earnings performance. We also generated significant cash flow from operations in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Seagate arbitration award.
The diversified nature of our business, together with ongoing secular growth in data and crisp execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, continued to enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance. Market dynamics in the December quarter were in line with our expectations.
In our business, we saw a particular strength and demand for capacity enterprise and video surveillance hard drives and for Enterprise SSDs. As anticipated, there was a seasonal demand uptick for branded products.
We expect ongoing hyperscale cloud deployments, coupled with our expanding product portfolio and customer engagement model, to continue fueling our growth and capacity enterprise for the foreseeable future. Petabyte growth in this category is expected to remain strong. Our Flash Platform Solutions business, which includes our expanding portfolio of enterprise class SSDs, maintained its growth trajectory in the quarter, delivering revenue of $187 million.
The demand outlook for the March quarter reflects a normal seasonal decline with moderation in client, branded products and performance enterprise with stable demand in capacity enterprise. We believe overall supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced.
I continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stabilization of the PC market where demand has been in line with our expectations. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the market's response to our strategic growth initiatives, which we believe position the company to thrive in the evolving data storage ecosystem.
We have strengthened our value proposition by enhancing our technical expertise, expanding our product portfolio and investing in our go-to-market capabilities. We will continue to prudently evaluate investment opportunities to advance these initiatives.
We gained traction in key markets during the December quarter. Our broad lineup of high-capacity hard drives, including those based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform continued to be embraced by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale data center customers. We continue to invest in high-growth vertical market applications. Specifically, we have seen strong customer acceptance of our WD Purple hard drives in the security surveillance market. We launched the 6-terabyte model in the December quarter that has been well received by customers. We expect strong ongoing growth in this space, given the rapid adoption of digital video cameras and security surveillance systems worldwide.
There continues to be strong growth momentum in branded with our portfolio of My Cloud solutions addressing both the consumer and pro-sumer markets. The My Cloud software and apps have now been downloaded by more than 4 million users worldwide.
We are engaged with customers and partners on our recently announced Active Archive platform. Proof-of-concept systems are up and running, and initial customer feedback has been positive. This new category of storage solution will feature high-density petascale capacities in a single rack, and deliver entirely new levels of storage efficiency and value. And as a reminder, we expect revenue growth from our Flash Platform's business to outpace that of the industry.
Before turning it over to Olivier, I would like thank and recognize our employees worldwide for helping to deliver a strong second quarter. Our consistent financial performance is a testament to the strength of our team, a well-diversified business, leading products and a customer-centric engagement model. Olivier?"

Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the December quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in October. In our business, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise, the anticipated seasonal increase in branded products as well as continued steady demand in performance enterprise.
Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain within our 4- to 6-week range. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $187 million in revenue related to our Flash Platform Solutions group.
We shipped a total of 61 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall LSP was driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance, along with the seasonal improvement in client and branded products.
Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%, which is better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $55 million of amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring charges.
Operating expenses totaled $644 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $620 million, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the flood insurance recovery. Expenses were higher than our implied guidance due to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights.
Tax expense for the December quarter was $20 million or 4% of pretax income. The tax rate reflects the retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter.
Our net income totaled $460 million or $1.93 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. This includes the $0.07 per share tax benefit from the R&D tax credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. In the December quarter, we generated $243 million in cash from operations and a free cash flow -- and our free cash flow totaled $97 million. As a reminder, we paid a total of $773 million related to an arbitration award in the December quarter.
Our CapEx totaled $146 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $309 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.
We closed Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was held in the U.S.
I will now provide guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion; gross margin percentage roughly flat with our Q2 performance, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $610 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the tax rate of approximately 7.5%; and the share count of approximately 237 million.
Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.90 and $2.00 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

And we know and we've said this in the past that the PC market is more price sensitive and there's less ability to differentiate, and accordingly those products, carry lower margin profiles.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5",511,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. 
For the third fiscal quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.87. I'm satisfied with our execution and results in light of the PC demand challenges that were largely driven by weak macro economic conditions. 
We delivered a solidly profitable quarter with continued strong cash generation and proved average selling price and healthy gross margins. Overall, our storage shipments for the March quarter were 61 exabytes, up 14% year-over-year. 
We continue to carefully balance the management of short-term market dynamics with a strong focus on long-term value creation. This is reflected in our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Fiscal year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders and share repurchases and dividends, while continuing to invest in high-growth markets opportunities. We continue to make strong progress on several strategic growth initiatives. Our Enterprise SSD business was accretive for the quarter and grew revenues by 67% year-over-year to $224 million. 
We also launched our new Ultrastar solutions in the enterprise space, addressing the industry transition to standards-based PCIe solutions. We surpassed 1 million Helium hard drive deployments and are now ramping our new 8-terabyte PMR HelioSeal drives. 
We shipped our first Active Archive System, a new category of high-value-added archival storage product addressing a market of approximately $15 billion. 
We completed the acquisition of Amplidata, a key building block of our vertical innovation strategy for Active Archive systems. We expanded our line of purpose-built drives for the fast-growing surveillance video recording space. And we launched 4 new models of high-performance NAS system for the SMB space. 
These initiatives provide revenue expansion opportunities for our company as we leverage our capabilities and resources in a rapidly changing storage ecosystem. 
Turning to our outlook. We continue to see growth in exabyte shipments during calendar 2015 and beyond. However, we anticipate that global macro economic headwinds will persist in the short term, further impacting PC sales. Given this, we are cautious with regards to our near-term outlook. We believe this is prudent in the current environment and consistent with our focus on long-term value creation. That being said, we are fully prepared to meet any upside in demand that may occur as we progress through the June quarter. We are optimistic that the demand environment will improve in the second half of the year. 
We will continue to optimize our infrastructure and related investments to the current demand profile. That being said, our ability to respond to changing market dynamics is affected by the MOFCOM hold separate restriction. This is one of the central arguments that I continue to make in our regular interactions with MOFCOM. Lifting the hold separate restriction would be beneficial to consumers and our customers by promoting innovation and enhancing the competitive environment. Olivier will now provide a summary of our March quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter."

Tax expense for the March quarter was $28 million or 7% of pretax income.  On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $441 million or $1.87 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In the March quarter, we generated $684 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $534 million. Our CapEx totaled $150 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $240 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. 
We closed Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, of which approximately $880 million was held in the U.S. 
I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Excluding the amortization of intangibles, gross margin percentage to be around the midpoint of our business model of 27% to 32%. Operating expenses of approximately $590 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.50 and $1.60 for the June quarter.

But we think that the TAM for fiscal Q3 was about 125 million units. Coming into the quarter, we would've expected the TAM to be something in the range of 135 million. The weakness that we saw during the quarter was entirely attributable to weakness in the PC market, largely driven by weakness from a broader global macro economic perspective. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we expect that those headwinds from a global macro economic perspective are going to persist going into the second quarter, again, affecting PC sales. And we think that the TAM will be something in around 120 million unit range. Now one other point to indicate. From an enterprise demand perspective, whether that be enterprise demand for traditional customers or more cloud-related customers, demand there continues to be healthy and came in pretty much along our expectations, both from an industry perspective and as well as a from a company perspective. And then going into the second half of the year, we are optimistic that the demand environment will improve, primarily due to a few things. One, we do expect that PC sales will pick up. We are optimistic in that regard. We'll begin to see a seasonal uptick related to gaming units. I mean, we'll also see a seasonal uptick from the demand perspective in terms of things like our branded business, those more consumer-oriented segments, coupled with continued strength in terms of the enterprise market."

I mean, a large portion of that delta is due to lack of synergies from related to the whole separate situation. The other thing is which is I don't mean to sound as a cop out because it may sound like a cop out. But keep in mind that our OpEx model was set back in September of 2012. One of the things that we need to do as the composition of our business changes and our investments change accordingly is a resetting of that model appropriate. I'm not suggesting that it is or it is not. It's just something that we would have to contemplate. But clearly, one of the things that we're going to have to do as we move forward is look at ways at optimizing our expenditures. And we talked about that in terms of managing short-term dynamics with longer-term value creation. And that becomes a bit more challenging, as you see -- as we did in this past quarter, a faster deceleration in the PC market, largely driven by temporal factors."

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5",512,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. 
For the third fiscal quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.87. I am satisfied with our execution and results in light of the PC demand challenges that were largely driven by weak macroeconomic conditions. 
We delivered a solidly profitable quarter with continued strong cash generation, improved average selling price and healthy gross margins. Overall, our storage shipments for the March quarter were 61 exabytes, up 14% year-over-year. 
We continue to carefully balance the management of short-term market dynamics with a strong focus on long-term value creation. This is reflected in our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Fiscal year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, while continuing to invest in high-growth markets opportunities. We continue to make strong progress on several strategic growth initiatives. Our Enterprise SSD business was accretive for the quarter and grew revenues by 67% year-over-year to $224 million. 
We also launched our new Ultrastar NVMe solutions in the enterprise space, addressing the industry transition to standards-based PCIe solutions. We surpassed 1 million Helium hard drive deployments and are now ramping our new 8-terabyte PMR Helium Seal drives. 
We shipped our first Active Archive system, a new category of high-value-added archival storage product addressing a market of approximately $15 billion. 
We completed the acquisition of Amplidata, a key building block of our vertical innovation strategy for Active Archive systems. We expanded our line of purpose-built drives for the fast-growing surveillance video recording space. And we launched 4 new models of high-performance NAS systems for the SMB space. 
These initiatives provide revenue expansion opportunities for our company as we leverage our capabilities and resources in the rapidly changing storage ecosystem. 
Turning to our outlook. We continue to see growth in exabyte shipments during calendar 2015 and beyond. However, we anticipate that global macro economic headwinds will persist in the short term, further impacting PC sales. Given this, we are cautious with regards to our near-term outlook. We believe this is prudent in the current environment and consistent with our focus on long-term value creation. That being said, we are fully prepared to meet any upside in demand that may occur as we progress through the June quarter. We are optimistic that the demand environment will improve in the second half of the year. 
We will continue to optimize our infrastructure and related investments to the current demand profile. That being said, our ability to respond to changing market dynamics is affected by the MOFCOM hold separate restriction. This is one of the central arguments that I continue to make in our regular interactions with MOFCOM. Lifting the hold separate restriction would be beneficial to consumers and our customers by promoting innovation and enhancing the competitive environment.

Turning to the balance sheet. In the March quarter, we generated $684 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $534 million. Our CapEx totaled $150 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $240 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. 
We closed Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, of which approximately $880 million was held in the U.S.

But we think that the TAM for fiscal Q3 was about 125 million units. Coming into the quarter, we would've expected the TAM to be something in the range of 135 million. The weakness that we saw during the quarter was entirely attributable to weakness in the PC market, largely driven by weakness from a broader global macroeconomic perspective. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we expect that those headwinds from a global macroeconomic perspective are going to persist going into the second quarter, again, affecting PC sales. And we think that the TAM will be something in around the 120 million unit range. Now one other point to indicate. From an enterprise demand perspective, whether that be enterprise demand for traditional customers or for cloud-related customers. Demand there continues to be healthy and came in pretty much along our expectations, both from an industry perspective and as well as a from a company perspective. And then going into the second half of the year, we are optimistic that the demand environment will improve, primarily due to a few things. One, we do expect that PC sales will pick up. We're optimistic in that regard. We'll begin to see a seasonal uptick related to gaming units. And then we'll also see a seasonal uptick from the demand perspective in terms of things like our branded business, those more consumer-oriented segments, coupled with continued strength in terms of the enterprise market."

The one question, which I talked about on our earnings call last quarter is the question is how will that specifically impact our unit demand, which is a function of the deployment of new capacity points as well as the acceptance of these new capacity points on behalf of our customers. So for example, as we deploy a 8-terabyte drive, what will be the take rate on that by our customers? And obviously, if you ship an 8-terabyte, you don't need 2 or 4 terabytes.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5",511,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. 
For the third fiscal quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.87. I am satisfied with our execution and results in light of the PC demand challenges that were largely driven by weak macroeconomic conditions. 
We delivered a solidly profitable quarter with continued strong cash generation, improved average selling price and healthy gross margins. Overall, our storage shipments for the March quarter were 61 exabytes, up 14% year-over-year. 
We continue to carefully balance the management of short-term market dynamics with a strong focus on long-term value creation. This is reflected in our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Fiscal year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, while continuing to invest in high-growth market opportunities. We continue to make strong progress on several strategic growth initiatives. Our Enterprise SSD business was accretive for the quarter and grew revenues by 67% year-over-year to $224 million. 
We also launched our new Ultrastar NVMe solutions in the enterprise space, addressing the industry transition to standards-based PCIe solutions. We surpassed 1 million Helium hard drive deployments and are now ramping our new 8-terabyte PMR Helium sealed drives. 
We shipped our first Active Archive system, a new category of high-value-added archival storage product addressing a market of approximately $15 billion. 
We completed the acquisition of Amplidata, a key building block of our vertical innovation strategy for Active Archive systems. We expanded our line of purpose-built drives for the fast-growing surveillance video recording space. And we launched 4 new models of high-performance NAS systems for the SMB space. 
These initiatives provide revenue expansion opportunities for our company as we leverage our capabilities and resources in the rapidly changing storage ecosystem. 
Turning to our outlook. We continue to see growth in exabyte shipments during calendar 2015 and beyond. However, we anticipate that global macroeconomic headwinds will persist in the short term, further impacting PC sales. Given this, we are cautious with regards to our near-term outlook. We believe this is prudent in the current environment and consistent with our focus on long-term value creation. That being said, we are fully prepared to meet any upside in demand that may occur as we progress through the June quarter. We are optimistic that the demand environment will improve in the second half of the year. 
We will continue to optimize our infrastructure and related investments to the current demand profile. That being said, our ability to respond to changing market dynamics is affected by the MOFCOM hold separate restriction. This is one of the central arguments that I continue to make in our regular interactions with MOFCOM. Lifting the hold separate restriction would be beneficial to consumers and our customers by promoting innovation and enhancing the competitive environment. 
Olivier will now provide a summary of our March quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter."

Tax expense for the March quarter was $28 million or 7% of pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $441 million or $1.87 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In the March quarter, we generated $684 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $534 million. Our CapEx totaled $150 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $240 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. 
We closed Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, of which approximately $880 million was held in the U.S.

But we think that the TAM for fiscal Q3 was about 125 million units. Coming into the quarter, we would've expected the TAM to be something in the range of 135 million, right. The weakness that we saw during the quarter was entirely attributable to weakness in the PC market, largely driven by weakness from a broader global macroeconomic perspective. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we expect that those headwinds from a global macroeconomic perspective are going to persist going into the second quarter, again, affecting PC sales. And we think that the TAM will be something in around the 120 million unit range. Now one other point to indicate. From an enterprise demand perspective, whether that be enterprise demand for traditional customers or for cloud-related customers. Demand there continues to be healthy and came in pretty much along our expectations, both from an industry perspective and as well as a from a company perspective. And then going into the second half of the year, we are optimistic that the demand environment will improve, primarily due to a few things. One, we do expect that PC sales will pick up. We're optimistic in that regard. We'll begin to see a seasonal uptick related to gaming units. And then we'll also see a seasonal uptick from a demand perspective in terms of things like our branded business, those more consumer-oriented segments, coupled with continued strength in terms of the enterprise market."

We continue to see strong receptivity to our product and good traction there. As I had in my prepared remarks, we've recently announced our PCIe NVMe offering. And what we're seeing in that space, which we have been anticipating for a while, is a move away from proprietary based PCIe solutions to, call it, a standards-based NVMe solution. We'll begin to see the impact of that from a revenue perspective as we move through the balance of 2015 from a calendar year perspective. And so as of right now, that is not meaningfully indicated, at least our revenue performance, over the past quarter."

And again, as I alluded to in our prepared remarks, we're expecting to see strong petabyte growth, particularly in the hyperscale accounts. The one question, which I had talked about on our earnings call last quarter is -- the question is how will that specifically impact our unit demand, which is a function of the deployment of new capacity points as well as the acceptance of those new capacity points on behalf of our customers. So for example, as we deploy a 8-terabyte drive, what will be the take rate on that by our customers? And obviously, if you ship an 8-terabyte, you don't need 2 4-terabytes. And so the impact on our units is the one that is a little bit more variable. But what is -- we do feel very strongly about is continued growth in petabyte growth and hyperscale deployments."

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter. 
Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected, given a weak PC market. In that context, I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51. 
Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes, up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution. 
Our Enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million, demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SAS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the Enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new Ultrastar PCIe and VME offering. It has been qualified with several leading customers, and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016. 
We saw strong demand for our high-capacity Helium and 15K RPM 2.5-inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose-built solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new Active Archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact, driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for our enterprise storage business remains healthy, and we believe we are well positioned to address this growing market space. 
Regarding PC market demand. We believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term, given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylight launches. That being said, we are seeing early signs of market stabilization, leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up toward the end of this calendar year. A more stable PC market demand environment, coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business, provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the meantime, we will continue to be disciplined at the management of our business while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes. 
I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings call, we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential timetable for them to complete their work. We have submitted a comprehensive report on the current market, which we believe shows that the storage ecosystem has evolved significantly in the last 3 years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We have also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our views on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM, we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts, and we are hopeful that they can conclude their valuation of our application to lift the hold separate in the near future. 
Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook."

In the June quarter, we generated $488 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $332 million. 
Our CapEx totaled $156 million or 5% of revenue. We repurchased 2 million shares for $198 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. 
We closed year-end with total cash and cash equivalents of $5 billion, of which approximately $700 million was held in the U.S. 
I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. Excluding the amortization of intangibles, we expect gross margin percentage to be roughly flat with our June quarter, operating expenses of approximately $575 million, and accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60.

You've sort of -- you've hit on them. But we're not entire visibility on those, by the way. But we believe that there has been meaningful inventory drawdown both on throughout the supply chain from a PC perspective. So -- and we certainly, from our own company perspective, have been very careful to not overdrive the market in terms of shipping too much inventory into our customers. And so we've seen a sharper decline in our client business than what we've seen from a broader PC perspective because of what we believe to be a meaningful spinning of the overall inventory supply line. That's one factor. To what extent that happened? That's difficult to determine. But clearly, our customers do not want to have or do not want to run the risk of having ""obsolete inventory"" in front of the Intel and the Microsoft transition. So that's clearly caused them to draw their inventory levels down. The second thing is that we naturally are going to decline faster than the broader PC market because of the increasing attached rate of solid-state devices, replacing hard drives, which is consistent, by the way, with our expectations. So that helps to explain at least some of the disconnect on our numbers versus the broader PC industry."

The increase from, let's just use $110 million because it's a round number, from $110 million to $115 million, that increase is driven by two factors: seasonal increase in gaming, seasonal increase in branded. That would imply that other segments of the market are flat from a unit perspective. And when you get into the PC market, we would expect that, that to be roughly flat, at least as it relates to hard drive shipments into the market. From an enterprise perspective, we believe that units will be roughly flat. Keep in mind, one of the comments that we made is that we believe that there will be meaningful increase in terms of exabyte shipments that as we're mixing up the higher capacities and shipping 6 terabyte and 8 terabyte, obviously the unit consumption gets affected by that such that the unit increase is more muted."

So as customers makes up, larger and larger percentage of our business, it's going to be Helium-based. Relative to head-to-head competition, a couple of things to keep in mind. First thing is, is that we -- the customers that we're dealing with have pretty sophisticated total cost of ownership algorithms that allow them to look at more than just simply the price of the hard drive. And we recognize the fact that clearly, the price of the hard drive is one element, but when we factor in from a total cost of ownership perspective, and we're going head-to-head at a similar capacity point, we actually have pretty good win rates. And in some cases, obviously, when we transition to the 8 terabyte right now, we got a distinct advantage from the capacity perspective, which assists us a lot in terms of winning business."

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter.
Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected, given a weak PC market. In that context, I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51.
Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes, up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution.
Our Enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million, demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SAS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the Enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new Ultrastar PCIe and VME offering. It has been qualified with several leading customers, and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016.
We saw strong demand for our high-capacity Helium and 15K RPM 2.5-inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose-built solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new Active Archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact, driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for our enterprise storage business remains healthy, and we believe we are well positioned to address this growing market space.
Regarding PC market demand, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term, given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylake launches. That being said, we are seeing early signs of market stabilization, leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up toward the end of this calendar year. A more stable PC market demand environment, coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business, provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the meantime, we will continue to be disciplined at the management of our business, while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes.
I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings call, we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential timetable for them to complete their work. We've submitted a comprehensive report on the current market, which, we believe, shows that the storage ecosystem has evolved significantly in the last 3 years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We've also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our views on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM, we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts, and we are hopeful that they can conclude their evaluation of our application to lift the hold separate in the near future.
Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook."

Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8%, and operating expenses totaled $516 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 7% of non-GAAP pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $356 million or $1.51 per share.
In the June quarter, we generated $488 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $332 million.
Our CapEx totaled $156 million or 5% of revenue. We repurchased 2 million shares for $198 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed year-end with total cash and cash equivalents of $5 billion, of which approximately $700 million was held in the U.S.
I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. Excluding the amortization of intangibles, we expect gross margin percentage to be roughly flat, with our June quarter operating expenses of approximately $575 million, and accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60.

So -- and we certainly, from our own company perspective, have been very careful to not overdrive the market in terms of shipping too much inventory into our customers. And so we've seen a sharper decline in our client business than what we've seen from a broader PC perspective because of what we believe to be a meaningful thinning of the overall inventory supply line, that's one factor. To what extent that's happened, that's difficult to determine. But clearly, our customers do not want to have or do not want to run the risk of having ""obsolete inventory"" in front of the Intel and the Microsoft transition, so that's clearly caused them to draw their inventory levels down. The second thing is that we naturally are going to decline faster than the broader PC market because of the increasing attach rate of solid-state devices replacing hard drives, which is consistent, by the way, with our expectations. So that helps to explain at least some of the disconnect on our numbers versus the broader PC industry."

But we would expect that the TAM for last quarter to be somewhere between 110 million and 112 million, depending upon where Toshiba lands. The TAM that we are using for purposes of our guidance, or assuming for purposes of the guidance, would approximate 115 million. The increase from, let's just use 110 million because it's a round number, from $110 million to $115 million, that increase is driven by 2 factors:  seasonal increase in gaming; seasonal increase in branded. That would imply that other segments of the market are flat from a unit perspective. And when you get into the PC market, we would expect that to be roughly flat, at least as it relates to hard drive shipments into the market. From an enterprise perspective, we believe that units will be roughly flat. Keep in mind, one of the comments that we made is that we believe that there will be meaningful increase in terms of exabyte shipments that as we're mixing up the higher capacities and shipping 6 terabyte and 8 terabyte, obviously, the unit consumption gets affected by that such that the unit increase is more muted."

So as customers mix up, a larger and larger percentage of our business is going to be Helium-based. Relative to head-to-head competition, a couple of things to keep in mind. First thing is that we -- the customers that we're dealing with have pretty sophisticated total cost of ownership algorithms that allow them to look at more than just simply the price of the hard drive. And we recognize the fact that clearly, the price of the hard drive is one element, but when we factor in from a total cost of ownership perspective, and we're going head-to-head at a similar capacity point, we actually have pretty good win rates.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter.
Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected, given a weak PC market. In that context, I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51.
Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes, up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution.
Our Enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million, demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SAS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new Ultrastar PCIe and VME offering. It has been qualified with several leading customers, and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016.
We saw strong demand for our high-capacity Helium and 15K RPM 2.5-inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose-built solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new Active Archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact, driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for our enterprise storage business remains healthy, and we believe we are well positioned to address this growing market space.
Regarding PC market demand, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term, given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylake launches. That being said, we are seeing early signs of market stabilization leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up toward the end of this calendar year. A more stable PC market demand environment, coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business, provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the meantime, we will continue to be disciplined in the management of our business, while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes.
I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings call, we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential timetable for them to complete their work. We've submitted a comprehensive report on the current market, which, we believe, shows that the storage ecosystem has evolved significantly in the last 3 years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We've also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our views on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM, we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts, and we are hopeful that they can conclude their evaluation of our application to lift the hold separate in the near future.
Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook."

In the June quarter, we generated $488 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $332 million.
Our CapEx totaled $156 million or 5% of revenue. We repurchased 2 million shares for $198 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed year-end with total cash and cash equivalents of $5 billion, of which approximately $700 million was held in the U.S.
I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. Excluding the amortization of intangibles, we expect gross margin percentage to be roughly flat with our June quarter, operating expenses of approximately $575 million, and accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60.

So -- and we certainly, from our own company perspective, have been very careful to not overdrive the market in terms of shipping too much inventory into our customers. And so we've seen a sharper decline in our client business than what we've seen from a broader PC perspective because of what we believe to be a meaningful thinning of the overall inventory supply line. That's one factor. To what extent that's happened, that's difficult to determine. But clearly, our customers do not want to have or do not want to run the risk of having ""obsolete inventory"" in front of the Intel and the Microsoft transition, so that's clearly caused them to draw their inventory levels down. The second thing is that we naturally are going to decline faster than the broader PC market because of the increasing attach rate of solid-state devices replacing hard drives, which is consistent, oh by the way, with our expectations. So that helps to explain at least some of the disconnect on our numbers versus the broader PC industry."

But we would expect that the TAM for last quarter to be somewhere between $110 million and $112 million, depending upon where Toshiba lands. The TAM that we are using for purposes of our guidance, or assuming for purposes of the guidance, would approximate $115 million. The increase from, let's just use 110 million because it's a round number, from $110 million to $115 million, that increase is driven by 2 factors:  seasonal increase in gaming; seasonal increase in branded. That would imply that other segments of the market are flat from a unit perspective. And when you get into the PC market, we would expect that to be roughly flat, at least as it relates to hard drive shipments into the market. From an enterprise perspective, we believe that units will be roughly flat. Keep in mind, one of the comments that we made is that we believe that there will be meaningful increase in terms of exabyte shipments that, as we're mixing up the higher capacities and shipping 6 terabyte and 8 terabyte, obviously, the unit consumption gets affected by that such that the unit increase is more muted."

But obviously, as we've indicated over time, we'll be transitioning, particularly when we move to the 10 terabyte and things like that where -- and the 6 terabyte is intended to be our last in-air product. So as customers mix up, a larger and larger percentage of our business is going to be Helium-based. Relative to head-to-head competition, a couple of things to keep in mind. First thing is that we -- the customers that we're dealing with have pretty sophisticated total cost of ownership algorithms that allow them to look at more than just simply the price of the hard drive. And we recognize the fact that clearly, the price of the hard drive is one element, but when we factor in from a total cost-of-ownership perspective, and we're going head-to-head at a similar capacity point, we actually have pretty good win rates. And in some cases, obviously, if we transition to the 8 terabyte right now, we've got a distinct advantage from that capacity perspective, which assists us a lot in terms of winning business."

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter. 
This is an important time for Western Digital. We have announced several transformational developments over the last few weeks, including the planned investment at our company by Unisplendour, the decision by MOFCOM and the planned acquisition of SanDisk. Coupled with our continued strong execution in the business, I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
We are proceeding with our integration into a single company as outlined in the MOFCOM decision, and we are submitting our applications for the regulatory reviews associated with the SanDisk acquisition and Unisplendour investment. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. 
Turning to the September quarter. Industry demand for hard drives was moderately higher than expected, driven primarily by strength in demand for 2.5-inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs. We reported revenues of $3.4 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 28.9% and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our storage shipments for the September quarter grew to 64 exabytes from 56 exabytes in the June quarter. These results reflect continued strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution. Our Enterprise SSD revenue grew significantly to $233 million, reflecting the continued success of our SAS SSD products in an increasingly competitive environment. Additionally, we continue to ramp our new Ultrastar PCIe NVMe offering. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives also continued its rapid growth as customers embraced our expanding lineup of these multipurpose, or purpose built solutions. 
We continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our now Active Archive System. We anticipate this new systems business will generate meaningful revenue next fiscal year. We saw a good demand for our enterprise hard drives, especially our high-capacity helium drives, with more than 1 million units shipped in the quarter. We are volume shipping our 8-terabyte helium drive and we'll be ramping our 10-terabyte helium drive in the year ahead. Overall, demand in the high-capacity space was somewhat softer than anticipated. This was due to absorption of previously deployed storage assets purchased earlier in the calendar year by some of our large customers. 
Notwithstanding cyclicality within a given period, growth in the Capacity Enterprise sector will continue, with a 35% CAGR and exabytes anticipated on an annualized basis through 2020. This is underpinned by the ongoing growth in data being created and stored. 
Looking to the PC market. We are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand, driven by innovation, refresh cycles and normalization of PC inventories. We believe we have the opportunity to improve our financial performance due to the integration synergies associated with the recent MOFCOM decision, coupled with our continued favorable mix of business. Longer-term, the acquisition of SanDisk and the investment by Unisplendour will help transform our company into a storage technology leader with a broader set of products, deeper technology base and an expanded addressable market. 
Olivier will now provide a summary of our September quarter performance and our outlook."

Western Digital and SanDisk will mail the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus to their respective stockholders. Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statement prospectives carefully when it becomes available because it contains important information about the merger.

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter.
This is an important time for Western Digital. We have announced several transformational developments over the last few weeks, including the planned investment in our company by Unisplendour, the decision by MOFCOM and the planned acquisition of SanDisk. Coupled with our continued strong execution in the business, I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees.
We are proceeding with our integration into a single company as outlined in the MOFCOM decision, and we are submitting our applications for the regulatory reviews associated with the SanDisk acquisition and Unisplendour investment. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.
Turning to the September quarter. Industry demand for hard drives was moderately higher than expected, driven primarily by strength in demand for 2.5-inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs. We reported revenues of $3.4 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 28.9% and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our storage shipments for the September quarter grew to 64 exabytes from 56 exabytes in the June quarter. These results reflect continued strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution.
Our Enterprise SSD revenue grew significantly to $233 million, reflecting the continued success of our SAS SSD products in an increasingly competitive environment. Additionally, we continue to ramp our new Ultrastar PCIe NVMe offering. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives also continued its rapid growth as customers embraced our expanding lineup of these multipurpose or purpose-built solutions.
We continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our now Active Archive system. We anticipate this new systems business will generate meaningful revenue next fiscal year. We saw a good demand for our enterprise hard drives, especially our high-capacity helium drives, with more than 1 million units shipped in the quarter. We are volume shipping our 8-terabyte helium drive and we'll be ramping our 10-terabyte helium drive in the year ahead. Overall, demand in the high-capacity space was somewhat softer than anticipated. This was due to absorption of previously deployed storage assets purchased earlier in the calendar year by some of our large customers.
Notwithstanding cyclicality within a given period, growth in the Capacity Enterprise sector will continue, with a 35% CAGR and exabytes anticipated on an annualized basis through 2020. This is underpinned by the ongoing growth in data being created and stored.
Looking to the PC market. We are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand, driven by innovation, refresh cycles and normalization of PC inventories. We believe we have the opportunity to improve our financial performance due to the integration synergies associated with the recent MOFCOM decision, coupled with our continued favorable mix of business. Longer-term, the acquisition of SanDisk and the investment by Unisplendour will help transform our company into a storage technology leader with a broader set of products, deeper technology base and an expanded addressable market.
Olivier will now provide a summary of our September quarter performance and our outlook."

The call does not constitute an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation of any note -- any vote or approval in connection with the pending merger with SanDisk.
Western Digital will file a Form S-4 registration statement that includes proxy statements of SanDisk and Western Digital, and a prospectus of Western Digital regarding the merger. Western Digital and SanDisk will mail the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus to their respective stockholders. Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statement prospectives carefully when it becomes available because it contains important information about the merger.

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter.
This is an important time for Western Digital. We have announced several transformational developments over the last few weeks, including the planned investment in our company by Unisplendour, the decision by MOFCOM and the planned acquisition of SanDisk. Coupled with our continued strong execution in the business, I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees.
We are proceeding with our integration into a single company as outlined in the MOFCOM decision, and we are submitting our applications for the regulatory reviews associated with the SanDisk acquisition and Unisplendour investment. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.
Turning to the September quarter. Industry demand for hard drives was moderately higher than expected, driven primarily by strength in demand for 2.5-inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs. We reported revenues of $3.4 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 28.9% and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our storage shipments for the September quarter grew to 64 exabytes from 56 exabytes in the June quarter. These results reflect continued strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution.
Our Enterprise SSD revenue grew significantly to $233 million, reflecting the continued success of our SAS SSD products in an increasingly competitive environment. Additionally, we continue to ramp our new Ultrastar PCIe NVMe offering. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives also continued its rapid growth as customers embraced our expanding lineup of these multipurpose or purpose-built solutions.
We continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new Active Archive system. We anticipate this new systems business will generate meaningful revenue next fiscal year. We saw a good demand for our enterprise hard drives, especially our high-capacity helium drives, with more than 1 million units shipped in the quarter. We are volume shipping our 8-terabyte helium drive and we'll be ramping our 10-terabyte helium drive in the year ahead. Overall, demand in the high-capacity space was somewhat softer than anticipated. This was due to absorption of previously deployed storage assets purchased earlier in the calendar year by some of our large customers.
Notwithstanding cyclicality within a given period, growth in the Capacity Enterprise sector will continue, with a 35% CAGR and exabytes anticipated on an annualized basis through 2020. This is underpinned by the ongoing growth in data being created and stored.
Looking to the PC market. We are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand, driven by innovation, refresh cycles and normalization of PC inventories. We believe we have the opportunity to improve our financial performance due to the integration synergies associated with the recent MOFCOM decision, coupled with our continued favorable mix of business. Longer-term, the acquisition of SanDisk and the investment by Unisplendour will help transform our company into a storage technology leader with a broader set of products, deeper technology base and an expanded addressable market.
Olivier will now provide a summary of our September quarter performance and our outlook."

And then, this has been addressed to a certain extent, but I would like to try to tease it out a little bit more. The $500 million of OpEx synergies with SanDisk. From my understanding, there's 3 main buckets -- I'm sorry, not OpEx synergies, overall synergies. There are 3 main buckets from where this is going to come from, PC express sales overlap, branded distribution and interface engineering. And if there's anything else I'm missing, please let me know but can you rank order what you believe each of these are going to be in terms of magnitude?"

So I'm not going to comment specifically on that. What we have said is that the lion's share of that $500 million will be the benefit that we will get by being vertically integrated on -- in our SSD business or existing SSD business. And there will be some OpEx synergies, but we have not quantified that. By the way, the other thing is, is that we've indicated the $500 million will be 18 months after the close of the transaction, which basically means that there will be further synergies beyond that 18-month period that we've yet to quantify publicly."

Or is that just kind of recapturing the profit that SanDisk would have brought on otherwise? I guess my question is, when you add 1 plus 1, does it equal 2 plus $500 million, right?
