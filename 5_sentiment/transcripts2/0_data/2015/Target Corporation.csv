Sorry about the technical difficulties that delayed us a couple of minutes there. 
On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer. 
This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance and our priorities going forward and Kathee will provide insights into holiday and fourth quarter results across our merchandise categories. And finally, John will provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. 
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others, who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, given that we're hosting our Financial Community Meeting in New York next week, our remarks today will focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. At next week's meeting, we will describe in detail our longer-term expectations, including full year 2015 financial performance. As a result, we are shortening today's call to 45 minutes, and we look forward to spending another 2.5 hours with all of you next week.

Appreciate your patience this morning. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than l",1178,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. Appreciate your patience this morning. 
We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than last year and above the high end of the updated range we provided in our January 15 press release. 
Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was also stronger than the updated guidance we provided in January as we saw unexpected strength in our store channel sales in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And of course, when we look back at our point of view going into the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth turned out to be nearly double our original expectation as our combination of products, promotions, holiday marketing, fulfillment capabilities and in-store execution drove profitable growth in an intensely promotional environment. 
We are pleased that comps in all 3 months of the quarter were positive, and November's strength was particularly notable given that were annualizing the strong increase in November 2013. We're also pleased that traffic was a primary driver of our fourth quarter growth as well as the fact that the digital channel growth contributed nearly a full percentage point to our fourth quarter comparable sales increase. 
Our fourth quarter gross margin performance was also very strong with a favorable mix reflecting strength in signature categories. Our merchant teams did an outstanding job managing inventory flow, benefiting both in-stocks and gross margin, which was particularly challenging this quarter in light of the slowdown in productivity at the West Coast ports. 
Once again, our store teams did an outstanding job of managing corporate cost in the fourth quarter, delivering productivity improvements along with outstanding service to our guests. As I've mentioned to many of you, one of our priorities going forward is to harness best practices from our stores and apply them to the rest of the organization to modernize the way we work and drive productivity improvements while maintaining quality in everything we do. 
If we look back at the full year, it's clear that 2014 was a year of transition, in which we began to lay the foundation for the transformation we will accomplish in the next few years. A year ago, we were in a recovery mode, working to repair guest relationships following the data breach while we undertook an assessment of the long-term prospects for our Canadian business. 
Fast forward to today, and we've ended the year with a data breach fully behind us, and now that we made tough decision to exit the Canadian business, our team is focused and aligned on 5 priorities I outlined in our third quarter call. 
The first priority is to drive industry-leading digital sales growth as we build the capabilities to become a leading omni-channel retailer. Our digital growth led the industry in 2014, and we're working to build on that success in 2015 and beyond. 
Our second priority is to clearly define roles for each of our merchandise categories and build appropriate plans for each of them. While we're in the early stages of this journey, I am pleased with our efforts to invest in the growth of our signature categories that like Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness. These are the categories we're most famous for, and our guests has asked us to lead with them in the years ahead. 
Beyond the signature categories, we're defining appropriate roles for each of our categories, and we'll invest in them appropriately to ensure we're providing our guest convenience through a differentiated, inspirational and one-stop shopping experience. 
Our third priority is to become much more localized in the assortment and experience we provide in our stores and more personalized in our digital interaction with our guests. We are in the very early stages of these efforts, and we see huge opportunity ahead of us. So we're investing in these capability still need to make progress on this priority over the next few years. 
Our fourth priority is to new format that will help us better serve our guests over time. We're seeing strong financial results from our 8 CityTarget stores, and we've seen very strong initial performance in the test of our first Target express location, which opened here in the Twin Cities last August. 
In 2015, of the 50 new stores we're planning to open, more than half of these are new formats with 8 additional Express stores and a new CityTarget set to open in Boston next to Fenway Park. 
And finally, we're committed to reducing complexity and controlling costs in order to fuel our investments in the growth priorities I've just outlined. As mentioned earlier, our stores have been leading the way in these efforts. So in the next few years, we're looking for opportunities outside our stores to become more agile, move faster, gain scale efficiencies in the way we work. 
We believe meaningful opportunities exist, and the leadership team is committed to moving decisively to modernize the way we work and create the capacity we'll need to invest in the priorities that will drive growth and returns on invested capital. 
At our meeting with you next week, we're looking forward to providing more specifics on how we're planning to advance these 5 priorities while providing insight in how our plans will translate into financial results, both this year and over the long term. 
Our plan for the day is as follows: I'll lead off the day by providing details on our strategic priorities, our approach to growth and the principles guiding our leadership team as we work to deliver on these priorities. Then John will provide more detail on our financial expectations for each line of the P&L going forward, and he will provide full year guidance for 2015 financial results from continuing operations, reflecting our plan to grow earnings per share this year. Casey Carl will follow with details on our digital progress and his plans to transform the organization by developing new capabilities that will support our growth, control costs and recapture the innovative spirit that's part of the company's DNA. Then Kathee Tesija will provide more insight into our core guest and our plans to develop products, experience and formats to serve those guests over time. And then Jeff Jones will provide insight into the guests' relationship with the Target brand and his team's work to modernize our marketing and the way we interact with today's core guest. Finally, we'll end with a Q&A session. 
We're looking forward to the opportunities to share these plans with you next week, and we're confident that we can build on the early momentum we've seen over the last few quarters. We have a fantastic foundation to build on with a great brand, loyal guests and an outstanding team, and we're committed to maintaining our focus on our key priorities and making the tough decisions to position Target for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kathee to recap our fourth quarter and holiday season performance. Kathee?"
174438,278542358,769729,"Target Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. Retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced a pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales in",1807,"Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. Retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced a pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales in the early and late portions of the season and experienced a period of softness in the middle. 
Specifically, throughout November, our comparable sales performance, including the Black Friday weekend, was very strong on both the 1-year and 2-year basis driven by strong promotions throughout the month combined with in-store events and Cartwheel daily deals. 
In December, following a characteristic lull that we've seen for more than a decade, we saw a very strong surge in traffic and sales in the days leading up to and after Christmas. 
And in January, we continued to see unexpected strong results throughout the month. As Brian mentioned, we saw particularly strong trends in fourth quarter sales in our signature categories specifically health care, Beauty, Apparel and Home all grew faster than our overall sales. 
Within Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids, and Home comps were led by Domestics and Seasonal items. In Hardlines, our Toy category had a fantastic quarter, recording a double-digit increase in comparable sales driven by a strong lineup of Target exclusive items throughout the assortment. 
Average retails were up across all of our categories as guests were trading up within assortments, and we saw strong regular price sell-throughs in Seasonal and markdown-sensitive categories. Digital channel growth also contributed to the growth in the average retail, particularly in Home and Apparel, both of which saw digital channel penetration growth of more than a percentage point in the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the holiday season, we were very pleased with the performance of our fourth quarter limited time partnership with TOMS and Faribault Woolen Mill. Guest responded to the stories behind these brands, and we're delighted by the combination of quality and price we could deliver. 
I already mentioned the great quarter in Toys, which we supported this year with the launch of our kids Wish List app, a fun, interactive way for kids to let their families know which gifts were at the top of their list. We saw strong guest engagement with this new app as nearly half the families who used it created the list for 2 or more kids. And by the end of the season, thousands of new target.com accounts have been created by Wish List users. 
Our intention going forward -- excuse me, our intention getting offer to ship all digital orders for free to the holiday season provided compelling value and convenience to our guests. The offer created a surge in traffic and conversion on both our conventional sites and mobile, which, as expected, was partially offset by a moderate decline in average transaction size. 
Because our guests responded so well to this holiday promotion, we were excited earlier this week to announce that going forward, we are reducing the order threshold for free shipping from $50 to $25 with virtually no exclusion. This new minimum is among the most compelling offers in general retailing, putting us ahead of many of our key competitors. 
In our digital channel for the fourth quarter overall, we saw a high single-digit increase in visits driven entirely by growth in mobile, which includes both tablets and smartphones. Orders were up well over 50% driven by very strong conversion increases on both the conventional site and mobile. Mobile is becoming increasingly important to all digital retailers, and given the profile of our guests, it's particularly important for Target as mobile accounted for more than 40% of our digital orders in the fourth quarter. 
And notably on Black Friday, 10% of our iPhone app revenue was from guests purchasing on their phone while they were simultaneously shopping one of our stores. Our flexible fulfillment efforts play a key role in supporting our digital growth, and we're pleased with the results of our Store Pickup program and our recent rollout of ship-from-store capability. This was the second holiday season in which we've offered Store Pickup, and since last year, we've added more dry grocery items, extended the pickup window from 2 to 4 days, and we've begun testing dedicated parking spots. 
This year, we had more than 400,000 Store Pickup orders on the Black Friday week alone, and they accounted for half of our digital traffic in the last 4 days leading up to Christmas. For the year in total, 84% of Store Pickup orders were picked on time, and 35% of the time, guests who picked up a digital order also shop the store on the same visit. 
This was our first holiday season with ship-from-store capabilities having rolled out to 139 stores at the end of the third quarter. This capability allows us to ship more than 60,000 items directly from stores to our guests' front doors, dramatically cutting shipping times while reducing our shipping costs. 
We were pleased with the ability of this initial group of stores to handle the shipments from their back rooms, which peaked in the last week of November. And importantly, this capability allowed us to continue to fulfill holiday orders late in the season for items which were already sold through in our fulfillment centers but still available in our stores, allowing us to capture incremental sales. 
Before I move to our plans going forward, I want to pause and discuss the situation at the West Coast port. As you know, the slowdown at these ports began several months ago, and our fourth quarter performance clearly demonstrates that our team was effective in handling the slowdown by rerouting, expediting and pre-ordering inventory to support in stock. 
We were very pleased with last weekend's news that a tentative agreement had been reached, but we know it will be some time before the backlog at these ports will be fully eliminated. In the meantime, we have contingency plans to continue to work around potential issues. But at times, entire periods of light inventory and some assortments. 
Now I want to give you a few highlights of our plans going forward, and of course, we will have much more to cover with you next week. Last year, we began to test and rollout a variety of store presentation innovations to elevate the shopping experience and differentiate our brand. 
Based on the guest response to these changes, we are planning to accelerate our rollout in 2015. For example, following the addition of mannequins the Apparel floor pads in more than 600 stores last fall, we are planning to roll them out to another 400 stores this quarter. And based on the guest response to our enhanced Entertainment and Electronics experience, which is currently in 42 stores, we plan to roll this environment out to another 275 stores this year. 
In Home, we've begun testing highly inspirational then yet to show product in lifestyle setting, which we're rolling out to another 15 stores this quarter. Further back in the testing phase, we are looking at innovations to bring even more fun to our toy area with easier navigation, interactive experiences, larger-than-life displays and floor graphic. 
We are always looking for creative platforms to engage guests in new ways that are meaningful to them. Snap Chat provides a fun channel for us to quickly share exclusive behind-the-scenes content with our guests that they can't get anywhere else. If you are one of the fans who witnessed Target's Snap Chat debut, you caught a glimpse of the first story, which teased our history making Grammy commercial with Imagine Dragons to announce the Target exclusive version of their new album containing 4 exclusive bonus tracks. 
Jeff will have more to say about this groundbreaking Grammy moment at our meeting next week. Guests are excited about the recent launch of our new plus-size brand, Ava and Viv, which we launched earlier this month. Designed by our own product design and development team, Ava and Viv features stylish basics along with trend-driven statement pieces. Similar to Target's other Apparel line, Ava and Viv will be updated monthly with prices ranging from $10 to $80. 
And the anticipation is building for our upcoming partnership with Lilly Pulitzer. With a modern interpretation of the American resortwear brand exuberant prints and patterns, the limited-edition Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection features 15 exclusive trends, which are original works of art created by Lilly Pulitzer artist specifically for this modern collaboration. 
Available exclusively at all Target stores in the U.S. and on target.com beginning April 19, the 250-piece Collection includes Apparel, accessories and Shoes for women and girls as well as Home accents, outdoor entertaining accessories, beach gear, travel essentials and more. 
And finally, as Brian mentioned, wellness is one of the signature categories in which we're reinventing or investing to differentiate our brand and our assortment from the competition. We have a huge opportunity in this space because our guests have told us it's particularly important to them. Specifically, nearly every household that shops at Target buys natural and organic products, and more than half of them indicate that they prefer to purchase natural and organic products when available. 
These guests insights are reinforced by their behavior in our stores. While overall sales in the natural and organic industry are growing rapidly, sales of these categories at Target are growing even faster, outpacing the industry by 50% in 2014. 
The ""Made to Matter"" collection remains one of the most prominent and active examples of Target's focus on wellness, offering guests a selection of natural organic and sustainable product across multiple categories. In 2014, sales of the brands featured in our ""Made to Matter"" collection grew twice as fast at Target than they did elsewhere in the market. In 2015, we'll reinforce our commitment to newness and better-for-you choices with the refreshed ""Made to Matter"" handpicked by Target collection. 
This year's collection will double in size compared to last year, delivering more than 200 new and exclusive products from 31 leading and upcoming brands. As we look ahead to the new year, our priorities in merchandising are clear. We will build appropriate plans for each of our categories based on the role they play on supporting our brand and delivering superior shopping experience. 
In our signature categories, we will invest in product development, marketing, fixtures and store service to elevate and differentiate both the assortments and the shopping experience, fully delivering on our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making some early progress in this work, and we are dedicated to moving much faster in this transformation in 2015. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for first quarter 2015. John?"

Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected driven by better-than-expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 is better than the high end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update and about",1362,"Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected driven by better-than-expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 is better than the high end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update and about $0.11 better than our expectations for U.S. performance at the beginning of the quarter. 
Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.49, about $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS driven by a combined $0.02 of dilution from the reduction of the beneficial interest asset combined with net data breach expenses, partially offset by the benefit from resolution of income tax matters. 
Fourth quarter GAAP EPS losses of $4.10 reflects a $5.59 in losses from discontinued Canadian operations. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was above the guidance of our around 3% that we provided in our January update and nearly double the 2% growth we expected at the beginning of the quarter. 
More than all the sales outperformance for the last few weeks of the quarter was in our stores as digital channel sales came in a bit softer than expected in those last few weeks, reflecting a slowdown in demand sales growth as we annualized over promotions from a year ago combined with returns, which came in somewhat higher than expected. 
Even so, digital channel sales increased a robust 36% in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong increase in the fourth quarter of 2013. And as Brian mentioned, digital channel growth delivered about 90 basis points of our fourth quarter comparable sales increase, up from a 60 basis point contribution in the third quarter. 
U.S. REDcard penetration of 21.1% was about 20 basis points ahead of last year and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, based on trends of new accounts, we believe this quarter represented a trough in penetration growth. And we expect to see a moderate reacceleration in penetration growth in 2015. This growth should benefit later in the year from the introduction of chip and pin technology for all of our REDcards and the changeover to MasterCard on our legacy co-branded Credit Card program. 
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 9.9% was somewhat stronger than expected driven by very strong gross margin rate performance, partially offset by a small increase in our SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our fourth quarter gross margin rate of 28.5% was nearly a percentage point higher than a year ago and the strongest fourth quarter performance we've seen since 2010. This year, rate benefited from a favorable mix of sales growth in our signature categories combined with better markdown rate as we annualized last year's clearance and promotional activity following the announcement of the data breach. 
I want to pause here and comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 6% higher than last year. This increase was intentional and reflects 2 separate decisions. 
First, in the last 6 months, we've chosen to increase our inventory in commodity categories to enhance in-stocks in these frequency driving businesses; and second, we are ahead in import categories in light of the slowdown of the West Coast ports. 
Bottom line, the inventory increase is the result of specific decisions we've made, and we feel very good about our overall inventory level as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Heading back to the fourth quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage on pay and benefits, offset by higher marketing, technology and expense rates compared with last year. 
Altogether, our fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher from last year. 
Moving to consolidated. Fourth quarter interest expense was up about 6% from last year, and we paid $330 million in dividend in the quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. 
As expected, we didn't repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. However, as we discussed in our January update, the exit from the Canadian market will meaningfully improve our credit metrics going forward. And provided the wind down of our Canadian operations continues to operate to proceed as planned, we will be in a position to revisit the possibility of share repurchase later in 2015. 
As always, I'll reiterate that we will only reasonably repurchase activity if we believe it can be accomplished within the limits of our current investment-grade credit rating. 
As we look back at full year performance in the U.S., our 2014 adjusted EPS of $4.27 was down slightly from $4.38 in 2013 driven by earlier challenges as we recovered from the data breach. However, the healing of our business has been evident in the progression of our financial results throughout the year. 
Specifically, comparable sales, digital channel growth and year-over-year gross margin rate performance all improved as we move throughout 2014, and expenses remained well controlled throughout the year. 
Next week at our meeting with you in New York, we will outline in detail our plans to build on this early momentum over the next few years. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, I want to cover a small change to our adjusted EPS reporting, which we present in order to reflect the results of operations from what is now a single segment business. 
Given that we have now amortized $151 million or 2/3 of the original value of the beneficial interest asset related to the 2013 sale of our Credit Card receivables portfolio, beginning 2015, we will no longer the amortization of the beneficial interest from our adjusted EPS calculation. This is because both the quarterly amortization amounts and the year-over-year changes in those amounts are expected to be material going forward. And therefore, we believe our reporting will be streamlined when we make this change. 
In our reporting throughout 2015, prior year adjusted EPS results will also reflect this change to ensure consistency for comparison purposes. 
With that, let's move to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect our comparable sales to increase about 2% driven by an increase in digital channel sales of 30% or more combined with modest growth in store channel sales. 
While it's still early in the quarter, our results for the first few weeks of February are consistent with that forecast. On our first quarter sales, we expect our gross margin rate to improve 40 to 50 basis points from last year as we annualized last year's very intense promotions, which we used to recash traffic coming out of the data breach. 
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our first quarter rate to be flat to down slightly from a year ago as we expect that benefit from store productivity improvements will be offset by higher marketing and technology expense rates compared with last year. 
We expect our G&A expense rate to be about 10 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of continued investments in technology to support our digital, flexible fulfillment efforts. 
Altogether, we are expecting an improvement in our first quarter EBIT margin of 30 to 40 basis points above last year. First quarter interest expense should be approximately flat to last year, and tax expense is expected to be about $50 million higher than last year, reflecting improved profitability and a higher consolidated tax rate compared with the year ago. 
Altogether, these expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business of $0.95 to $1.05 compared with $0.92 a year ago. 
As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'll wait until next week's Financial Community Meeting to provide specific guidance for full year 2015 earnings growth as well as our expected financial algorithm over the longer term. This will allow us to present our financial outlook in the full context of our specific business plans, which reflect necessary investments to accelerate growth and build capabilities along with the opportunity to reduce costs over time, providing fuel to fund those investments. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

I can tell you that the entire leadership team has prioritized one, increasing traffic to our stores; and two, visits to our sites. Those are critically important as we go forward. So we're going to do that by executing many of the priorities that we outlined today. We certainly want to make sure we're building the right digital and importantly, mobile capabilities that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests not only when they're shopping at home but also when they're shopping inside of our stores. And Cartwheel is a great example of how we've used digital to drive greater engagement. I am really pleased, and Kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter, and it's critically important that while we're in the early stages, we're already seeing the guest react well to our focus on Style, on Baby and Kids and importantly, Wellness. And the fact that health care and Beauty and Home and Apparel outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter is a sign that we're connecting with the guest, and we're certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in store. So our focus on elevating signature categories, we think, brings our guests back to Target more often. They're going to be coming back in to see what's new. And Kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new, exciting products coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience and merchandising. So those elements are critically important. We think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guest, which will result in more traffic and more visits. And certainly, as we expand our smaller format, both CityTarget and TargetExpress, it's a way for us to engage the guest in these urban settings that are critically important. So all of those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement, but the metrics that are going to be important for us is to ensure that results in more traffic like it did in the fourth quarter and more visits to our site. So we're pleased with Q4. Lots of work in front of us, but I felt very good as the entire leadership team that our comp increase of 3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. And our industry-leading growth in digital, it was certainly going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site."

We spent several days visiting our stores, looking at competitive food retailers as we begin to build our reinvention plans for food.

Sorry about the technical difficulties that delayed us a couple of minutes there. 
On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer. 
This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance and our priorities going forward and Kathee will provide insights into holiday and fourth quarter results across our merchandise categories. And finally, John will provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. 
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others, who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, given that we're hosting our Financial Community Meeting in New York next week, our remarks today will focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. At next week's meeting, we will describe in detail our longer-term expectations, including full year 2015 financial performance. As a result, we are shortening today's call to 45 minutes, and we look forward to spending another 2.5 hours with all of you next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments in the fourth quarter and holiday season. Brian?"

Appreciate your patience this morning. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than l",1181,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. Appreciate your patience this morning. 
We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than last year and above the high end of the updated range we provided in our January 15 press release. 
Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was also stronger than the updated guidance we provided in January as we saw unexpected strength in our store channel sales in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And of course, when we look back at our point of view going into the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth turned out to be nearly double our original expectations, as our combination of products, promotions, holiday marketing, fulfillment capability and in-store execution drove profitable growth in an intensely promotional environment. 
We are pleased that comps in all 3 months of the quarter were positive, and November's strength was particularly notable given that we were annualizing a strong increase in November 2013. We're also pleased that traffic was the primary driver of our fourth quarter growth as well as the fact that the digital channel growth contributed nearly a full percentage point to our fourth quarter comparable sales increase. 
Our fourth quarter gross margin performance was also very strong with a favorable mix reflecting strength in signature categories. Our merchant team did an outstanding job managing inventory flow, benefiting both in-stock and gross margin, which was particularly challenging this quarter in light of the slowdown in productivity at the West Coast ports. 
Once again, our store teams did an outstanding job of managing corp cost in the fourth quarter, delivering productivity improvements along with outstanding service to our guests. As I've mentioned to many of you, one of our priorities going forward is to harness best practices from our stores and apply them to the rest of the organization to modernize the way we work and drive productivity improvements while maintaining quality in everything we do. 
If we look back at the full year, it's clear that 2014 was a year of transition, in which we began to lay the foundation for the transformation we will accomplish in the next few years. A year ago, we were in a recovery mode, working to repair guest relationships following the data breach while we undertook an assessment of the long-term prospects for our Canadian business. 
Fast forward to today, and we've ended the year with a data breach fully behind us, and now that we made tough decision to exit the Canadian business, our team is focused and aligned on 5 priorities I outlined in our third quarter call. 
The first priority is to drive industry-leading digital sales growth as we build the capabilities to become a leading omnichannel retailer. Our digital growth led the industry in 2014, and we're working to build on that success in 2015 and beyond. 
Our second priority is to clearly define roles for each of our merchandise categories and build appropriate plans for each of them. While we're in the early stages of this journey, I am pleased with our efforts to invest in the growth of our signature categories like Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness. These are the categories we're most famous for, and our guests has asked us to lead with them in the years ahead. 
Beyond the signature categories, we're defining appropriate roles for each of our categories, and we'll invest in them appropriately to ensure we're providing our guest convenience through a differentiated, inspirational and one-stop shopping experience. 
Our third priority is to become much more localized in the assortment and experience we provide in our stores and more personalized in our digital interaction with our guests. We are in the very early stages of these efforts, and we see huge opportunity ahead of us. So we're investing in these capabilities we'll need to make progress on this priority over the next few years. 
Our fourth priority is to develop and test new formats that will help us better serve our guests over time. We're seeing strong financial results from our 8 CityTarget stores, and we've seen very strong initial performance in the test of our first TargetExpress location, which opened here in the Twin Cities last August. 
In 2015, of the 50 new stores we're planning to open, more than half of these are new formats with 8 additional Express stores and a new CityTarget set to open in Boston next to Fenway Park. 
And finally, we're committed to reducing complexity and controlling costs in order to fuel our investments in the growth priorities I've just outlined. As mentioned earlier, our stores have been leading the way in these efforts. So in the next few years, we're looking for opportunities outside our stores to become more agile, move faster, gain scale efficiencies in the way we work. 
We believe meaningful opportunities exist, and the leadership team is committed to moving decisively to modernize the way we work and create the capacity we'll need to invest in the priorities that will drive growth and returns on invested capital. 
At our meeting with you next week, we're looking forward to providing you more specifics on how we're planning to advance these 5 priorities while providing insight in how our plans will translate into financial results, both this year and over the long term. 
Our plan for the day is as follows: I'll lead off the day by providing details on our strategic priorities, our approach to growth and the principles guiding our leadership team as we work to deliver on these priorities. Then John will provide more detail on our financial expectations for each line of the P&L going forward, and he will provide full year guidance for 2015 financial results from continuing operations, reflecting our plan to grow earnings per share this year. Casey Carl will follow with details on our digital progress and his plans to transform the organization by developing new capabilities that will support our growth, control costs and recapture the innovative spirit that's part of the company's DNA. Then Kathee Tesija will provide more insight into our core guest and our plan to develop products, experience and formats to serve those guests over time. And then Jeff Jones will provide insight into the guest relationship with the Target brand and his team's work to modernize our marketing and the way we interact with today's core guest. Finally, we'll end with a Q&A session. 
We're looking forward to the opportunities to share these plans with you next week and we're confident that we can build on the early momentum we've seen over the last few quarters. We have a fantastic foundation to build on with a great brand, loyal guests and an outstanding team, and we're committed to maintaining our focus on our key priorities and making the tough decision to position Target for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kathee to recap our fourth quarter and holiday season performance. Kathee?"
174438,278542358,769989,"Target Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. Retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced the pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales",1804,"Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. Retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced the pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales in the early and late portions of the season and experienced a period of softness in the middle. 
Specifically, throughout November, our comparable sales performance, including the Black Friday weekend, was very strong on both the 1-year and 2-year basis driven by strong promotions throughout the month combined with in-store events and Cartwheel daily deals. 
In December, following the characteristic lull that we've seen for more than a decade, we saw a very strong surge in traffic and sales in the days leading up to and after Christmas. 
And in January, we continued to see unexpected strong results throughout the month. As Brian mentioned, we saw particularly strong trends in fourth quarter sales in our signature categories specifically health care, Beauty, Apparel and Home all grew faster than our overall sales. 
Within Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids, and Home comps were led by Domestics and Seasonal items. In Hardlines, our Toy category had a fantastic quarter, recording a double-digit increase in comparable sales driven by a strong lineup of Target exclusive items throughout the assortment. 
Average retails were up across all of our categories as guests were trading up within assortments, and we saw strong regular price sell-throughs in Seasonal and markdown-sensitive categories. Digital channel growth also contributed to the growth in the average retail, particularly in Home and Apparel, both of which saw digital channel penetration growth of more than a percentage point in the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the holiday season, we were very pleased with the performance of our fourth quarter limited-time partnerships with TOMS and Faribault Woolen Mill. Guests responded to the stories behind these brands, and we're delighted by the combination of quality and price we could deliver. 
I already mentioned the great quarter in Toys, which we supported this year with the launch of our Kids' Wish List app, a fun, interactive way for kids to let their families know which gifts were at the top of their list. We saw strong guest engagement with this new app, as nearly half the families who used it created a list for 2 or more kids. And by the end of the season, thousands of new target.com accounts had been created by Wish List users. 
Our intention going forward -- excuse me, our intention getting offer to ship all digital orders for free during the holiday season provided compelling value and convenience to our guests. The offer created a surge in traffic and conversion on both our conventional sites and mobile, which, as expected, was partially offset by a moderate decline in average transaction size. 
Because our guests responded so well to this holiday promotion, we were excited earlier this week to announce that going forward, we are reducing the order threshold for free shipping from $50 to $25 with virtually no exclusion. This new minimum is among the most compelling offers in digital retailing, putting us ahead of many of our key competitors. 
In our digital channel for the fourth quarter overall, we saw a high single-digit increase in visits driven entirely by growth in mobile, which includes both tablets and smartphones. Orders were up well over 50% driven by very strong conversion increases on both the conventional site and mobile. Mobile is becoming increasingly important to all digital retailers, and given the profile of our guests, it's particularly important for Target as mobile accounted for more than 40% of our digital orders in the fourth quarter. 
And notably on Black Friday, 10% of our iPhone app revenue was from guests purchasing on their phone while they were simultaneously shopping one of our stores. Our flexible fulfillment efforts play a key role in supporting our digital growth, and we're pleased with the results of our Store Pickup program and our recent rollout of ship-from-store capability. This was the second holiday season in which we've offered Store Pickup. And since last year, we've added more dry grocery items, extended the pickup window from 2 to 4 days, and we've begun testing dedicated parking spots. 
This year, we had more than 400,000 Store Pickup orders on the Black Friday week alone, and they accounted for half of our digital traffic in the last 4 days leading up to Christmas. For the year in total, 84% of Store Pickup orders were picked on time, and 35% of the time, guests who picked up a digital order also shop the store on the same visit. 
This was our first holiday season with ship-from-store capabilities having rolled out to 139 stores at the end of the third quarter. This capability allows us to ship more than 60,000 items directly from stores to our guests' front doors, dramatically cutting shipping times while reducing our shipping costs. 
We were pleased with the ability of this initial group of stores to handle the shipments from their back rooms, which peaked in the last week of November. And importantly, this capability allowed us to continue to fulfill holiday orders late in the season for items which were already sold through in our fulfillment centers, but still available in our stores, allowing us to capture incremental sales. 
Before I move to our plans going forward, I want to pause and discuss the situation at the West Coast port. As you know, the slowdown at these ports began several months ago, and our fourth quarter performance clearly demonstrates that our team was effective in handling the slowdown by rerouting, expediting and pre-ordering inventory to support in-stocks. 
We were very pleased with last weekend's news that a tentative agreement had been reached, but we know it will be some time before the backlog at these ports will be fully eliminated. In the meantime, we have contingency plans to continue to work around potential issues. But at times, we may encounter periods of light inventory in some assortments. 
Now I want to give you a few highlights of our plans going forward, and of course, we will have much more to cover with you next week. Last year, we began to test and roll out a variety of store presentation innovations to elevate the shopping experience and differentiate our brand. 
Based on the guest response to these changes, we are planning to accelerate our rollout in 2015. For example, following the addition of mannequins at the apparel floor pad in more than 600 stores last fall, we are planning to roll them out to another 400 stores this quarter. And based on the guest response to our enhanced Entertainment and Electronics experience, which is currently in 42 stores, we plan to roll this environment out to another 275 stores this year. 
In Home, we've begun testing highly inspirational vignettes to show product in lifestyle settings, which we're rolling out to another 15 stores this quarter. Farther back in the testing phase, we are looking at innovations to bring even more fun to our toy area with easier navigation, interactive experiences, larger-than-life displays and floor graphics. 
We are always looking for creative platforms to engage guests in new ways that are meaningful to them. Snapchat provides a fun channel for us to quickly share exclusive behind-the-scenes content with our guests that they can't get anywhere else. If you are one of the fans who witnessed Target's Snapchat debut, you caught a glimpse of the first story, which teased our history-making GRAMMY commercial with Imagine Dragons, to announce the Target-exclusive version of their new album containing 4 exclusive bonus tracks. 
Jeff will have more to say about this groundbreaking GRAMMY moment at our meeting next week. Guests are excited about the recent launch of our new plus-size brand, AVA & VIV, which we launched earlier this month. Designed by our own product design and development team, AVA & VIV features stylish basics along with trend-driven statement pieces. Similar to Target's other apparel line, AVA & VIV will be updated monthly with prices ranging from $10 to $80. 
And the anticipation is building for our upcoming partnership with Lilly Pulitzer. With a modern interpretation of the American resortwear brand's exuberant prints and patterns, the limited-edition Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection features 15 exclusive trends, which are original works of art created by Lilly Pulitzer artists specifically for this modern collaboration. 
Available exclusively at all Target stores in the U.S. and on target.com beginning April 19, the 250-piece collection includes apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls as well as home accents, outdoor entertaining accessories, beach gear, travel essentials and more. 
And finally, as Brian mentioned, wellness is one of the signature categories in which we're reinventing or investing to differentiate our brand and our assortment from the competition. We have a huge opportunity in this space because our guests have told us it's particularly important to them. Specifically, nearly every household that shops at Target buys natural and organic products, and more than half of them indicate that they prefer to purchase natural and organic products when available. 
These guests insights are reinforced by their behavior in our stores. While overall sales in the natural and organic industry are growing rapidly, sales of these categories at Target are growing even faster, outpacing the industry by 50% in 2014. 
The ""Made to Matter"" collection remains one of the most prominent and active examples of Target's focus on wellness, offering guests a selection of natural, organic and sustainable products across multiple categories. In 2014, sales of the brands featured in our ""Made to Matter"" collection grew twice as fast at Target than they did elsewhere in the market. In 2015, we'll reinforce our commitment to newness and better-for-you choices with the refreshed ""Made to Matter"" handpicked by Target collection. 
This year's collection will double in size compared to last year, delivering more than 200 new and exclusive products from 31 leading and upcoming brands. As we look ahead to the new year, our priorities in merchandising are clear. We will build appropriate plans for each of our categories based on the role they play in supporting our brand and delivering superior shopping experience. 
In our signature categories, we will invest in product development, marketing, fixtures and store service to elevate and differentiate both the assortments and the shopping experience, fully delivering on our ""Expect More. Pay Less."" brand promise. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making some early progress in this work, and we are dedicated to moving much faster in this transformation in 2015. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for first quarter 2015. John?"

Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected driven by better-than-expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 is better than the high end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update and about",1363,"Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected driven by better-than-expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 is better than the high end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update and about $0.11 better than our expectations for U.S. performance at the beginning of the quarter. 
Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.49, about $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS driven by a combined $0.02 of dilution from the reduction of the beneficial interest asset combined with net data breach expenses, partially offset by the benefit from the resolution of income tax matters. 
Fourth quarter GAAP EPS losses of $4.10 reflected $5.59 in losses from discontinued Canadian operations. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was above the guidance of around 3% that we provided in our January update and nearly double the 2% growth we expected at the beginning of the quarter. 
More than all of the sales outperformance in the last few weeks of the quarter was in our stores as digital channel sales came in a bit softer than expected in those last few weeks, reflecting a slowdown in demand sales growth as we annualized over promotions from a year ago combined with returns, which came in somewhat higher than expected. 
Even so, digital channel sales increased a robust 36% in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong increase in the fourth quarter of 2013. And as Brian mentioned, digital channel growth delivered about 90 basis points of our fourth quarter comparable sales increase, up from a 60-basis-point contribution in the third quarter. 
U.S. REDcard penetration of 21.1% was about 20 basis points ahead of last year and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, based on trends in new accounts, we believe this quarter represented a trough in penetration growth. And we expect to see a moderate reacceleration in penetration growth in 2015. This growth should benefit later in the year from the introduction of chip-and-PIN technology for all of our REDcards and the changeover to MasterCard on our legacy co-branded credit card program. 
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 9.9% was somewhat stronger than expected driven by very strong gross margin rate performance, partially offset by a small increase in our SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our fourth quarter gross margin rate of 28.5% was nearly a percentage point higher than a year ago and the strongest fourth quarter performance we've seen since 2010. This year's rate benefited from a favorable mix of sales growth in our signature categories combined with better markdown rates as we annualized last year's clearance and promotional activity following the announcement of the data breach. 
I want to pause here and comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 6% higher than last year. This increase was intentional and reflects 2 separate decisions. 
First, in the last 6 months, we've chosen to increase our inventory in commodity categories to enhance in-stocks in these frequency-driving businesses; and second, we are ahead in import categories in light of the slowdown of the West Coast ports. Bottom line, the inventory increase is the result of specific decisions we've made and we feel very good about our overall inventory level as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Getting back to the fourth quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage on pay and benefits, offset by higher marketing, technology and extensive expense rates compared with last year. Altogether, our fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. Fourth quarter interest expense was up about 6% from last year, and we paid $330 million in dividend in the quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. 
As expected, we didn't repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. However, as we discussed in our January update, the exit from the Canadian market will meaningfully improve our credit metrics going forward. And provided the wind down of our Canadian operations continues to operate to proceed as planned, we will be in a position to revisit the possibility of share repurchase later in 2015. 
As always, I will reiterate that we will only reasonably repurchase activity if we believe it can be accomplished within the limits of our current investment-grade credit rating. 
As we look back at full year performance in the U.S., our 2014 adjusted EPS of $4.27 was down slightly from $4.38 in 2013 driven by earlier challenges as we recovered from the data breach. However, the healing of our business has been evident in the progression of our financial results throughout the year. 
Specifically, comparable sales, digital channel growth and year-over-year gross margin rate performance all improved as we move throughout 2014, and expenses remained well controlled throughout the year. 
Next week at our meeting with you in New York, we will outline in detail our plans to build on this early momentum over the next few years. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, I want to cover a small change to our adjusted EPS reporting, which we present in order to reflect the results of operations from what is now a single segment business. 
Given that we have now amortized $151 million or 2/3 of the original value of the beneficial interest asset related to the 2013 sale of our Credit Card receivables portfolio, beginning 2015, we will no longer remove the amortization of the beneficial interest from our adjusted EPS calculation. This is because both the quarterly amortization amounts and the year-over-year changes in those amounts are expected to be immaterial going forward. And therefore, we believe our reporting will be streamlined if we make this change. 
In our reporting throughout 2015, prior year adjusted EPS results will also reflect this change to ensure consistency for comparison purposes. 
With that, let's move to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect our comparable sales to increase about 2% driven by an increase in digital channel sales of 30% or more combined with modest growth in store channel sales. 
While it's still early in the quarter, our results for the first few weeks of February are consistent with that forecast. On our first quarter sales, we expect our gross margin rate to improve 40 to 50 basis points from last year as we annualized last year's very intense promotions, which we used to recapture traffic coming out of the data breach. 
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our first quarter rate to be flat to down slightly from a year ago as we expect that benefit from store productivity improvements will be offset by higher marketing and technology expense rates compared with last year. 
We expect our G&A expense rate to be about 10 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of continued investments in technology to support our digital, flexible fulfillment efforts. 
Altogether, we are expecting an improvement in our first quarter EBIT margin of 30 to 40 basis points above last year. First quarter interest expense should be approximately flat to last year, and tax expense is expected to be about $50 million higher than last year, reflecting improved profitability and a higher consolidated tax rate compared with a year ago. 
Altogether, these expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business of $0.95 to $1.05 compared with $0.92 a year ago. 
As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're going to wait until next week's Financial Community Meeting to provide specific guidance for full year 2015 earnings growth as well as our expected financial algorithm over the longer term. This will allow us to present our financial outlook in the full context of our specific business plans, which reflect necessary investments to accelerate growth and build capabilities along with the opportunity to reduce costs over time, providing fuel to fund those investments. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

I'm sure Kathee will jump in, but I think overall what you have heard is there's certainly some savings relative to last year with the clearance activity that went on, but I think much more important to that is you saw the acceleration of what we -- the signature categories, Home, Apparel, Style, Kids, many of those with margin rates well in excess of our average margin rate. And I think for the first time, Kathee and I couldn't even remember the last time where both Home and Apparel out-comped the company. So we really saw a very strong mix in the quarter delivered by the product in the stores."

I can tell you that the entire leadership team has prioritized, one, increasing traffic to our stores; and two, visits to our sites. Those are critically important as we go forward. So we're going to do that by executing many of the priorities that we outlined today. We certainly want to make sure we're building the right digital and importantly, mobile capabilities that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests, not only when they're shopping at home, but also when they're shopping inside of our stores. And Cartwheel is a great example of how we've used digital to drive greater engagement. I am really pleased, and Kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter, and it's critically important that while we're in the early stages, we're already seeing the guest react well to our focus on Style, on Baby and Kids and importantly, Wellness. And the fact that health care and Beauty and Home and Apparel outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter is a sign that we're connecting with the guest, and we're certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in-store. So our focus on elevating signature categories, we think, brings our guests back to Target more often. They're going to be coming back in to see what's new. And Kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new, exciting products, coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience and merchandising. So those elements are critically important. We think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guest, which will result in more traffic and more visits. And certainly, as we expand our smaller format, both CityTarget and TargetExpress, it's a way for us to engage the guest in these urban settings that are critically important. So all of those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement, but the metrics that are going to be important for us is to ensure it results in more traffic like it did in the fourth quarter and more visits to our site. So we're pleased with Q4. Lots of work in front of us, but I felt very good as did the entire leadership team that our comp increase of 3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. And our industry-leading growth in digital, it was certainly going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site."

We really were pleased with the overall holiday."

Sorry about the technical difficulties that delayed us a couple of minutes there. 
On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer. 
This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance and our priorities going forward and Kathee will provide insights into holiday and fourth quarter results across our merchandise categories. And finally, John will provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. 
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others, who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, given that we're hosting our Financial Community Meeting in New York next week, our remarks today will focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. At next week's meeting, we will describe in detail our longer-term expectations, including full year 2015 financial performance. As a result, we are shortening today's call to 45 minutes, and we look forward to spending another 2.5 hours with all of you next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments in the fourth quarter and holiday season. Brian?"

Appreciate your patience this morning. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning.

We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than last year and above the high end of the updated range we provided in our January 15 press release. 
Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was also stronger than the updated guidance we provided in January as we saw unexpected strength in our store channel sales in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And of course, when we look back at our point of view going into the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth turned out to be nearly double our original expectations, as our combination of products, promotions, holiday marketing, fulfillment capability and in-store execution drove profitable growth in an intensely promotional environment. 
We are pleased that comps in all 3 months of the quarter were positive, and November's strength was particularly notable given that we were annualizing a strong increase in November 2013. We're also pleased that traffic was the primary driver of our fourth quarter growth as well as the fact that the digital channel growth contributed nearly a full percentage point to our fourth quarter comparable sales increase. 
Our fourth quarter gross margin performance was also very strong with a favorable mix reflecting strength in signature categories. Our merchant team did an outstanding job managing inventory flow, benefiting both in-stock and gross margin, which was particularly challenging this quarter in light of the slowdown in productivity at the West Coast ports. 
Once again, our store team did an outstanding job of managing core costs in the fourth quarter, delivering productivity improvements along with outstanding service to our guests. As I've mentioned to many of you, one of our priorities going forward is to harness best practices from our stores and apply them to the rest of the organization to modernize the way we work and drive productivity improvements while maintaining quality in everything we do. 
If we look back at the full year, it's clear that 2014 was a year of transition, in which we began to lay the foundation for the transformation we will accomplish in the next few years. A year ago, we were in the recovery mode, working to repair guest relationships following the data breach while we undertook an assessment of the long-term prospects for our Canadian business. 
Fast forward to today, and we've ended the year with the data breach fully behind us, and now that we've made the tough decision to exit the Canadian business, our team is focused and aligned on 5 priorities I outlined in our third quarter call. 
The first priority is to drive industry-leading digital sales growth as we build the capabilities to become a leading omnichannel retailer. Our digital growth led the industry in 2014, and we're working to build on that success in 2015 and beyond. 
Our second priority is to clearly define roles for each of our merchandise categories and build appropriate plans for each of them. While we're in the early stages of this journey, I am pleased with our efforts to invest in the growth of our signature categories like Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness. These are the categories we're most famous for, and our guests has asked us to lead with them in the years ahead. 
Beyond these signature categories, we're defining appropriate roles for each of our categories, and we'll invest in them appropriately to ensure we're providing our guests convenience through a differentiated, inspirational and one-stop shopping experience. 
Our third priority is to become much more localized in the assortment and experience we provide in our stores and more personalized in our digital interaction with our guests. We are in the very early stages of these efforts, and we see huge opportunity ahead of us. So we're investing in these capabilities; we'll need to make progress on this priority over the next few years. 
Our fourth priority is to develop and test new formats that will help us better serve our guests over time. We're seeing strong financial results from our 8 CityTarget stores, and we've seen very strong initial performance in the test of our first TargetExpress location, which opened here in the Twin Cities last August. 
In 2015, of the 50 new stores we're planning to open, more than half of these are new formats with 8 additional Express stores and a new CityTarget set to open in Boston next to Fenway Park. 
And finally, we're committed to reducing complexity and controlling costs in order to fuel our investments in the growth priorities I've just outlined. As mentioned earlier, our stores have been leading the way in these efforts. So in the next few years, we're looking for opportunities outside our stores to become more agile, move faster, gain scale efficiencies in the way we work. 
We believe meaningful opportunities exist, and the leadership team is committed to moving decisively to modernize the way we work and create the capacity we'll need to invest in the priorities that will drive growth and returns on invested capital. 
At our meeting with you next week, we're looking forward to providing you more specifics on how we're planning to advance these 5 priorities while providing insight in how our plans will translate into financial results, both this year and over the long term. 
Our plan for the day is as follows: I'll lead off the day by providing details on our strategic priorities, our approach to growth and the principles guiding our leadership team as we work to deliver on these priorities. Then John will provide more detail on our financial expectations for each line of the P&L going forward, and he will provide full year guidance for 2015 financial results from continuing operations, reflecting our plan to grow earnings per share this year. Casey Carl will follow with details on our digital progress and his plans to transform the organization by developing new capabilities that will support our growth, control costs and recapture the innovative spirit that's part of the company's DNA. Then Kathee Tesija will provide more insight into our core guests and our plan to develop products, experience and formats to serve those guests over time. And then Jeff Jones will provide insight into the guest relationship with the Target brand and his team's work to modernize our marketing and the way we interact with today's core guest. Finally, we'll end with a Q&A session. 
We're looking forward to the opportunity to share these plans with you next week and we're confident that we can build on the early momentum we've seen over the last few quarters. We have a fantastic foundation to build on with a great brand, loyal guests and an outstanding key team, and we're committed to maintaining our focus on our key priorities and making the tough decision to position Target for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kathee to recap our fourth quarter and holiday season performance. Kathee?"
174438,278542358,770222,"Target Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. Retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced the pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales",1805,"Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. Retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced the pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales in the early and late portions of the season and experienced a period of softness in the middle. 
Specifically, throughout November, our comparable sales performance, including the Black Friday weekend, was very strong on both a 1-year and 2-year basis, driven by strong promotions throughout the month combined with in-store events and Cartwheel daily deals. 
In December, following the characteristic lull that we've seen for more than a decade, we saw a very strong surge in traffic and sales in the days leading up to and after Christmas. 
And in January, we continued to see unexpected strong results throughout the month. As Brian mentioned, we saw particularly strong trends in fourth quarter sales in our signature categories, specifically health care, Beauty, Apparel and Home all grew faster than our overall sales. 
Within Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids, and Home comps were led by Domestics and Seasonal items. In Hardlines, our Toy category had a fantastic quarter, recording a double-digit increase in comparable sales driven by a strong lineup of Target exclusive items throughout the assortment. 
Average retails were up across all of our categories as guests were trading up within assortments, and we saw strong regular price sell-throughs in Seasonal and markdown-sensitive categories. Digital channel growth also contributed to the growth in the average retail, particularly in Home and Apparel, both of which saw digital channel penetration growth of more than a percentage point in the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the holiday season, we were very pleased with the performance of our fourth quarter limited-time partnerships with TOMS and Faribault Woolen Mill. Guests responded to the stories behind these brands, and we're delighted by the combination of quality and price we could deliver. 
I already mentioned the great quarter in Toys, which we supported this year with the launch of our Kids' Wish List app, a fun, interactive way for kids to let their families know which gifts were at the top of their list. We saw strong guest engagement with this new app, as nearly half the families who used it created a list for 2 or more kids. And by the end of the season, thousands of new target.com accounts had been created by Wish List users. 
Our intention going forward -- excuse me, our intention-getting offer to ship all digital orders for free during the holiday season provided compelling value and convenience to our guests. The offer created a surge in traffic and conversion on both our conventional sites and mobile, which, as expected, was partially offset by a moderate decline in average transaction size. 
Because our guests responded so well to this holiday promotion, we were excited earlier this week to announce that going forward, we are reducing the order threshold for free shipping from $50 to $25 with virtually no exclusion. This new minimum is among the most compelling offers in digital retailing, putting us ahead of many of our key competitors. 
In our digital channel for the fourth quarter overall, we saw a high single-digit increase in visits driven entirely by growth in mobile, which includes both tablets and smartphones. Orders were up well over 50% driven by very strong conversion increases on both the conventional site and mobile. Mobile is becoming increasingly important to all digital retailers, and given the profile of our guests, it's particularly important for Target as mobile accounted for more than 40% of our digital orders in the fourth quarter. 
And notably on Black Friday, 10% of our iPhone app revenue was from guests purchasing on their phone while they were simultaneously shopping one of our stores. Our flexible fulfillment efforts play a key role in supporting our digital growth, and we're pleased with the results of our Store Pickup program and our recent rollout of ship-from-store capability. This was the second holiday season in which we've offered Store Pickup. And since last year, we've added more dry grocery items, extended the pickup window from 2 to 4 days, and we've begun testing dedicated parking spots. 
This year, we had more than 400,000 Store Pickup orders on the Black Friday week alone, and they accounted for half of our digital traffic in the last 4 days leading up to Christmas. For the year in total, 84% of Store Pickup orders were picked on time, and 35% of the time, guests who picked up a digital order also shopped the store on the same visit. 
This was our first holiday season with ship-from-store capabilities, having rolled out to 139 stores at the end of the third quarter. This capability allows us to ship more than 60,000 items directly from stores to our guests' front doors, dramatically cutting shipping times while reducing our shipping costs. 
We were pleased with the ability of this initial group of stores to handle the shipments from their back rooms, which peaked in the last week of November. And importantly, this capability allowed us to continue to fulfill holiday orders late in the season for items which were already sold-through in our fulfillment centers, but still available in our stores, allowing us to capture incremental sales. 
Before I move to our plans going forward, I want to pause and discuss the situation at the West Coast port. As you know, the slowdown at these ports began several months ago, and our fourth quarter performance clearly demonstrates that our team was effective in handling the slowdown by rerouting, expediting and pre-ordering inventory to support in-stocks. 
We were very pleased with last weekend's news that a tentative agreement had been reached, but we know it will be some time before the backlog at these ports will be fully eliminated. In the meantime, we have contingency plans to continue to work around potential issues. But at times, we may encounter periods of light inventory in some assortments. 
Now I want to give you a few highlights of our plans going forward, and of course, we will have much more to cover with you next week. Last year, we began to test and roll out a variety of store presentation innovations to elevate the shopping experience and differentiate our brand. 
Based on the guest response to these changes, we are planning to accelerate our rollout in 2015. For example, following the addition of mannequins at the apparel floor pad in more than 600 stores last fall, we are planning to roll them out to another 400 stores this quarter. And based on the guests response to our enhanced Entertainment and Electronics experience, which is currently in 42 stores, we plan to roll this environment out to another 275 stores this year. 
In Home, we've begun testing highly inspirational vignettes to show products in lifestyle settings, which we're rolling out to another 15 stores this quarter. Farther back in the testing phase, we are looking at innovations to bring even more fun to our toy area with easier navigation, interactive experiences, larger-than-life displays and floor graphics. 
We are always looking for creative platforms to engage guests in new ways that are meaningful to them. Snapchat provides a fun channel for us to quickly share exclusive behind-the-scenes content with our guests that they can't get anywhere else. If you are one of the fans who witnessed Target's Snapchat debut, you caught a glimpse of the first story, which teased our history-making GRAMMY commercial with Imagine Dragons, to announce the Target-exclusive version of their new album containing 4 exclusive bonus tracks. 
Jeff will have more to say about this groundbreaking GRAMMY moment at our meeting next week. Guests are excited about the recent launch of our new plus-size brand, AVA & VIV, which we launched earlier this month. Designed by our own product design and development team, AVA & VIV features stylish basics along with trend-driven statement pieces. Similar to Target's other apparel line, AVA & VIV will be updated monthly with prices ranging from $10 to $80. 
And the anticipation is building for our upcoming partnership with Lilly Pulitzer. With a modern interpretation of the American resort wear brand's exuberant prints and patterns, the limited-edition Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection features 15 exclusive prints, which are original works of art created by Lilly Pulitzer artists specifically for this modern collaboration. 
Available exclusively at all Target stores in the U.S. and on target.com beginning April 19, the 250-piece collection includes apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls as well as home accents, outdoor entertaining accessories, beach gear, travel essentials and more. 
And finally, as Brian mentioned, wellness is one of the signature categories in which we're reinventing -- or investing to differentiate our brand and our assortment from the competition. We have a huge opportunity in this space because our guests have told us it's particularly important to them. Specifically, nearly every household that shops at Target buys natural and organic products, and more than half of them indicate that they prefer to purchase natural and organic products when available. 
These guests insights are reinforced by their behavior in our stores. While overall sales in the natural and organic industry are growing rapidly, sales of these categories at Target are growing even faster, outpacing the industry by 50% in 2014. 
The ""Made to Matter"" collection remains one of the most prominent and active examples of Target's focus on wellness, offering guests a selection of natural, organic and sustainable products across multiple categories. In 2014, sales of the brands featured in our ""Made to Matter"" collection grew twice as fast at Target than they did elsewhere in the market. In 2015, we'll reinforce our commitment to newness and better-for-you choices with the refreshed ""Made to Matter - Handpicked by Target"" collection. 
This year's collection will double in size compared to last year, delivering more than 200 new and exclusive products from 31 leading and upcoming brands. As we look ahead to the new year, our priorities in merchandising are clear. We will build appropriate plans for each of our categories based on the role they play in supporting our brand and delivering superior shopping experience. 
In our signature categories, we will invest in product development, marketing, fixtures and store service to elevate and differentiate both the assortments and the shopping experience, fully delivering on our ""Expect More. Pay Less."" brand promise. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making some early progress in this work, and we are dedicated to moving much faster in this transformation in 2015. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for first quarter 2015. John?"
174438,278542358,770222,"Target Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected driven by better-than-expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 is better than the high end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update and about",1362,"Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected driven by better-than-expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 is better than the high end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update and about $0.11 better than our expectations for U.S. performance at the beginning of the quarter. 
Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.49, about $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS driven by a combined $0.02 of dilution from the reduction of the beneficial interest asset combined with net data breach expenses, partially offset by the benefit from the resolution of income tax matters. 
Fourth quarter GAAP EPS losses of $4.10 reflected $5.59 in losses from discontinued Canadian operations. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was above the guidance of around 3% that we provided in our January update and nearly double the 2% growth we expected at the beginning of the quarter. 
More than all of the sales outperformance in the last few weeks of the quarter was in our stores as digital channel sales came in a bit softer than expected in those last few weeks, reflecting a slowdown in demand sales growth as we annualized over promotions from a year ago combined with returns, which came in somewhat higher than expected. 
Even so, digital channel sales increased a robust 36% in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong increase in the fourth quarter of 2013. And as Brian mentioned, digital channel growth delivered about 90 basis points of our fourth quarter comparable sales increase, up from a 60-basis-point contribution in the third quarter. 
U.S. REDcard penetration of 21.1% was about 20 basis points ahead of last year and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, based on trends in new accounts, we believe this quarter represented a trough in penetration growth. And we expect to see a moderate reacceleration in penetration growth in 2015. This growth should benefit later in the year from the introduction of chip-and-PIN technology for all of our REDcards and the changeover to MasterCard on our legacy co-branded credit card program. 
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 9.9% was somewhat stronger than expected driven by very strong gross margin rate performance, partially offset by a small increase in our SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our fourth quarter gross margin rate of 28.5% was nearly a percentage point higher than a year ago and the strongest fourth quarter performance we've seen since 2010. This year's rate benefited from a favorable mix of sales growth in our signature categories combined with better markdown rates as we annualized last year's clearance and promotional activity following the announcement of the data breach. 
I want to pause here and comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 6% higher than last year. This increase was intentional and reflects 2 separate decisions. 
First, in the last 6 months, we've chosen to increase our inventory in commodity categories to enhance in-stocks in these frequency-driving businesses; and second, we ordered ahead in import categories in light of the slowdown of the West Coast ports. Bottom line, the inventory increase is the result of specific decisions we've made and we feel very good about our overall inventory level as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Getting back to the fourth quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage on pay and benefits, offset by higher marketing, technology and extensive expense rates compared with last year. Altogether, our fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. Fourth quarter interest expense was up about 6% from last year, and we paid $330 million in dividends in the quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. 
As expected, we didn't repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. However, as we discussed in our January update, the exit from the Canadian market will meaningfully improve our credit metrics going forward. And provided the wind down of our Canadian operations continues to operate -- to proceed as planned, we will be in a position to revisit the possibility of share repurchase later in 2015. 
As always, I will reiterate that we will only resume repurchase activity if we believe it can be accomplished within the limits of our current investment-grade credit rating. 
As we look back at full year performance in the U.S., our 2014 adjusted EPS of $4.27 was down slightly from $4.38 in 2013 driven by earlier challenges as we recovered from the data breach. However, the healing of our business has been evident in the progression of our financial results throughout the year. 
Specifically, comparable sales, digital channel growth and year-over-year gross margin rate performance all improved as we move throughout 2014, and expenses remained well controlled throughout the year. 
Next week at our meeting with you in New York, we will outline in detail our plans to build on this early momentum over the next few years. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, I want to cover a small change to our adjusted EPS reporting, which we present in order to reflect the results of operations from what is now a single-segment business. 
Given that we have now amortized $151 million or 2/3 of the original value of the beneficial interest asset related to the 2013 sale of our Credit Card receivables portfolio, beginning in 2015, we will no longer remove the amortization of the beneficial interest from our adjusted EPS calculation. This is because both the quarterly amortization amounts and the year-over-year changes in those amounts are expected to be immaterial going forward. And therefore, we believe our reporting will be streamlined if we make this change. 
In our reporting throughout 2015, prior year adjusted EPS results will also reflect this change to ensure consistency for comparison purposes. 
With that, let's move to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect our comparable sales to increase about 2% driven by an increase in digital channel sales of 30% or more combined with modest growth in store channel sales. 
While it's still early in the quarter, our results for the first few weeks of February are consistent with that forecast. On our first quarter sales, we expect our gross margin rate to improve 40 to 50 basis points from last year as we annualized last year's very intense promotions, which we used to recapture traffic coming out of the data breach. 
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our first quarter rate to be flat to down slightly from a year ago as we expect that benefit from store productivity improvements will be offset by higher marketing and technology expense rates compared with last year. 
We expect our G&A expense rate to be about 10 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of continued investments in technology to support our digital, flexible fulfillment efforts. 
Altogether, we expect an improvement in our first quarter EBIT margin of 30 to 40 basis points above last year. First quarter interest expense should be approximately flat to last year, and tax expense is expected to be about $50 million higher than last year, reflecting improved profitability and a higher consolidated tax rate compared with a year ago. 
Altogether, these expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single-segment business of $0.95 to $1.05 compared with $0.92 a year ago. 
As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're going to wait until next week's Financial Community Meeting to provide specific guidance for full year 2015 earnings growth as well as our expected financial algorithm over the longer term. This will allow us to present our financial outlook in the full context of our specific business plans, which reflect necessary investments to accelerate growth and build capabilities along with the opportunity to reduce costs over time, providing fuel to fund those investments. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

Those are critically important as we go forward. So we're going to do that by executing many of the priorities that we outlined today. We certainly want to make sure we're building the right digital and, importantly, mobile capabilities that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests, not only when they're shopping at home, but also when they're shopping inside of our stores. And Cartwheel is a great example of how we've used digital to drive greater engagement. I am really pleased, and Kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter. And it's critically important that while we're in the early stages, we're already seeing the guests react well to our focus on Style, on Baby and Kids and importantly, Wellness. And the fact that health care and Beauty and Home and Apparel outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter is a sign that we're connecting with the guest, and we're certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in-store. So our focus on elevating signature categories, we think, brings our guests back to Target more often. They're going to be coming back in to see what's new. And Kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new, exciting products, coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience and merchandising. So those elements are critically important. We think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guest, which will result in more traffic and more visits. And certainly, as we expand our smaller format, both CityTarget and TargetExpress, it's a way for us to engage the guest in these urban settings that are critically important. So all of those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement, but the metrics that are going to be important for us is to ensure it results in more traffic like it did in the fourth quarter and more visits to our site. So we're pleased with Q4. Lots of work in front of us, but I felt very good as did the entire leadership team that our comp increase of 3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. And our industry-leading growth in digital, it was certainly going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site."

We spent several days visiting our stores, looking at competitive food retailers as we begin to build our reinvention plans for Food.

So a lot of the basics, but our gift card plans were well executed. We saw the guests come back in January. Our focus on wellness, that important signature category, well received.

We're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high end",1202,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Comp sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectation. This increase was driven by a healthy balance of growth in both traffic and average ticket. 
First quarter digital sales increased 38% over last year, driven by higher traffic and a substantial increase in conversion. Digital growth contributed 80 basis points to our comp sales increase in the first quarter. 
While we enjoyed a healthy pace of sales throughout the first quarter, we saw particularly strong results in March as weather warmed across many parts of the country and Easter timing moved seasonal sales into the month. In April, we were thrilled with the overall demand for items on our collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer, with most of the collection selling out in the first few days. 
We were disappointed, however, that our digital channels were not able to properly accommodate the surge in traffic at the time of the launch, and the team is working to address root causes and learn from the experience as we prepare for holiday season peak later this year. 
The first quarter saw meaningful increase in our gross margin rate as we cycled over a promotional first quarter 2014, and we benefited from very strong mix of sales in our signature categories this year, both in stores and online. 
First quarter comp sales in signature categories grew more than twice as fast as our comparable sales overall, and mix in our digital channels was even stronger. Specifically, about 2/3 of our first quarter digital sales increase was driven by growth in Home and Apparel. Kathee will provide more detail on category performance in a few minutes. 
Once again, our stores did a great job controlling costs this quarter while outside of the stores, we continue to move to a leaner, more agile way of working. 
During the first quarter, we recorded restructuring charges related to headcount reductions at our headquarters. While these reductions were very difficult for all of us, I strongly believe they were a necessary step to remove roadblocks, which were preventing us from moving more quickly and responsibly to the guest needs. 
I want to thank the team for their perseverance during this time of significant transition. I continue to admire the energy they bring to work every single day. 
As you know, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over time, and I'm very pleased that this quarter, we began returning cash to share repurchase for the first time in nearly 2 years. This change reflects the improving health of our U.S. business, along with the cash flow benefit of our fourth quarter decision to discontinue operations in Canada. 
For several quarters now, I've been talking about the 5 priorities we are focused on as a leadership team: becoming a leader in delivering shopping on demand for our guests; establishing clear roles in our merchandising categories with particular focus on growing our signature categories: Style, Baby, kids and wellness; developing capabilities to become more localized in our store experience and more personalized in our digital interaction with guests; continue to develop and test urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress; and finally, transforming the way we work to create capacity to invest appropriately in the growth initiatives I just described. 
I strongly believe if we make progress on these 5 priorities over the next few years, Target will deliver outstanding financial results and become a even stronger retailer. While we're at the early stages, I'm encouraged with signs of progress on these efforts. 
Specifically, our strong mix of first quarter sales in signature categories demonstrates the value of the work to define category roles. We continue to roll out upgraded fixtures in Apparel, Beauty, Beauty and Home while investing in wellness with programs like ""Made to Matter."" 
Our buying teams are focused on delivering enhanced newness, quality and value to our guests, and we're communicating this renewed focus in both traditional and digital channels. 
Our digital sales growth of nearly 40% on top of 30% growth a year ago shows that we have a meaningful opportunity to generate comp sales growth through investments in digital channels. And following our March headcount reductions at headquarters, our teams are taking a fresh look at everything we do and taking steps to remove approval layers and increase the speed of decision-making. 
While there will certainly be a meaningful adjustment process, I believe we will merge with an agile and engaged team that is equipped and empowered to act quickly on behalf of the guests. 
These signs of progress are meaningful to the team, and they demonstrate the value of our efforts and validate our strategic priorities yet as we look ahead, we realize we're on a much longer journey and need to accomplish many more things. Specifically, we're in the very early stages of our work on localization and personalization. In the future, these efforts should benefit both sales and gross margin rate. 
And while we're still in the testing phase, we're very encouraged by the progress in evaluating and rolling out urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress. We opened 2 new Express locations in the San Francisco market this quarter, both of which are quite different from our first location in the Minneapolis market. We expect to open 6 more locations this year in a variety of markets and demographic areas to continue to learn how to operate this new format in a diverse array of sizes and settings. 
Finally, we are just beginning to reinvent our Food assortment and presentation. We have an opportunity to drive more traffic and sales in this critical area of the store by becoming more specialized in our assortment, more focused on healthy options in the support of wellness. We're testing potential assortment and presentation options, and this year, we plan to study the guest response to potential changes before determining what we'll roll out more extensively next year. 
While this quarter's results are encouraging, we're focused on the work ahead of us as we transform ourselves to become a truly modern retailer and more relevant to our guests. We're taking the necessary steps, both in our investment decisions and the way we work, to position Target for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. 
The momentum we've seen so far makes us more confident than ever that we're moving in the right direction and encourages us to move even faster yet we know that long-term success depends on achieving the right balance between speed and the time it takes to confirm we're making the right changes that we can execute at scale. Once we have that confirmation, we're committed to moving forward, both quickly and confidently, in becoming the retailer our guests want Target to be. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kathee to recap our first quarter results and plans going forward."

In the first quarter, we saw encouraging trends across many dimensions of our business, including traffic, sales, merchandise mix, markdown rates, digital channel growth and overall profitability. 
Within our sales, our results reflect our continued focus on growing signature categories. Beauty had another outstanding quarter and delivered more than a 5% comp, but Apparel and Home were right behind with a mid-4% comp. 
Given weather trends and Easter timing, Apparel comps peaked in March but were strong throughout the quarter. Among the drivers was swim, where we saw better-than-expected results across the board in women's, men's and kids. 
In ready-to-wear, we saw particular strength in Merona and our new plus-size brand, Ava & Viv. And while it's small relative to the quarter, the response to the Lilly Pulitzer partnership was the icing on the cake as more than 90% of the Apparel items sold out the first day. 
Across the rest of our assortment, Food comps were just below the company average, and Hardlines experienced a mid-single-digit comp decline, reflecting a very tough comparison to last year when we saw particularly strong sales from Disney's Frozen, and elevated promotions drove sales in Electronics. 
As Brian mentioned, first quarter comparable sales were driven by a healthy combination of growth in both traffic and average ticket. Within average ticket, an increase in average Retail was partially offset by a decline in units per transaction. This decline in average units was driven by category mix, particularly Apparel, along with channel mix as digital transactions typically have fewer units at higher average Retail. 
Besides channel mix, growth in average Retail was driven by a lower level of promotional activity this year and the trend in which our guests are trading up to higher quality and premium branded items. 
We were really pleased with the pace of digital channel sales growth this quarter and even happier that it was driven by Home and Apparel, but our digital goals are ambitious, and we have a lot more work to do. So we're continuing to invest in and rollout new initiatives to maintain our momentum. 
The February launch of a lower $25 free shipping threshold drove a meaningful increase in conversion this quarter, and guests continue to embrace Store Pickup, which was up more than 100% from a year ago. 
Subscriptions are also growing rapidly. Sales on subscription grew 32% between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and the active subscriber base grew 20% within the first quarter. And we continue to see great results from our ship-from-store capability, which delivered shipping savings for us and reduced delivery times for our guests. And we expect to roll out this capability to more than 200 additional stores this fall. 
As I mentioned in the last call, we were very happy to see the West Coast port situation resolved yet we knew it would take a few months for the shipping backlog to be completely relieved. As of today, I'm pleased to say that those delays are fully behind us. 
Consistent with our fourth quarter experience, the team did a great job in the first quarter working around port-related issues by pre-ordering inventory and rerouting shipments. However, despite these efforts, some categories, including Shoes, saw in-stocks in the quarter and saw sales accelerate as receipts began to flow and in-stocks recovered. 
As we look ahead, we are working to build on our current momentum in the second quarter and beyond. In Apparel, beyond swim, we've been seeing encouraging trends in shorts, dresses, tanks and sandals and expect these businesses to be a key driver of second quarter sales. 
In Jewelry and accessories, this morning, we announced a new limited time partnership, Eddie Bourgault for Target, which launches -- that launches July 12. Eddie has crafted a first of its kind limited edition collection of customizable Jewelry accessories and wall art featuring the designer signature aesthetics and on-trend colors and finishes. 
In Home, we're seeing great momentum in our tabletop business, and we'll expand the offering this quarter with a broader selection of both indoor and outdoor options for summer entertaining. We're also excited
[Audio Gap]
programs, which will launch in July, featuring more exquisite content from licensed and exclusive brands and do-it-yourself programs, which will allow students to decorate their own journals, notebooks and lockers. 
In wellness, we continue to see amazing results from the ""Made to Matter"" collection. Since the announcement of this collection, featured brands are running up 25% to last year, and the collection is on track to record $1 billion in sales this year. 
And in kids, we have a blockbuster set of licensed programs planned for the second quarter and beyond. In stores now, we're offering about 150 items from the new Avengers movie, including many that are exclusive to Target. 
To support the release, we created an omni-channel marketing campaign that includes social media engagement and a uniquely creative stop motion broadcast spot that brings the actual 12-inch action figures to life. 
Also this summer, looks for exclusive items across multiple categories in celebration of the June release of Jurassic World and the July release of Minions. 
On target.com, we've expanded our license offering by creating experiences for our top 29 licenses. Each of these experiences includes favorite items that we carry in both channels plus expanded -- extended assortments that include collectibles, more Apparel choices and hard-to-find Toys. We will continue to roll out experiences to more of our favorite characters throughout the year. 
To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the iconic comic strip Peanuts, we're rolling out a summer collection of more than 100 exclusive products. These items are the work of our own product design and development team, who partnered with current Peanuts cartoonist and the Charles Schulz Museum, to design fresh, fun items that are true to the comic strip's roots. We'll rollout more exclusive items across multiple categories throughout the year, leading up to the release of the new Peanuts feature film in November. 
And finally, like moviegoers, we're already excited about the December movie release from the most famous license of them all, Star Wars. Earlier this month, as part of the worldwide May the Fourth Be With You event, we allowed Darth Vader and Yoda to take over the target.com home page offering special online-only deals on Star Wars license product. We'll provide more details on our next earnings call, but for now, I can assure you that Star Wars fans will find plenty of reasons to visit our stores and target.com this year. 
As we said many times, we're encouraged by our progress but recognize that we are only at the beginning of a multiyear journey to transform our business. We continue to roll out new store fixtures to enhance the shopping experience in Apparel, Baby, Electronics and Home, and we're working quickly to develop and test ideas to reinvent our Food area to become more specialized and more clearly embrace wellness with local products, naturals, organics and clean labels. And we continue to invest in our technology and supply chain capabilities to allow our guest to shop on demand and receive products where and when they want. 
The good news is that even though we have much more to do, the positive guest response to what we've already accomplished makes us confident we are moving in the right direction. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and beyond."
174438,290179418,819760,"Target Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance, particularly in our signature categories. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high end of the guidance range provide",1557,"Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance, particularly in our signature categories. 
Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.01, about $0.09 lower than adjusted EPS, driven primarily by pretax restructuring cost of $103 million combined with small adjustments for breach-related expenses and a favorable resolution of income tax matters. 
First quarter GAAP EPS of $0.98 included a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.24 loss on Canadian operations in the first quarter 2014. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 2.3% was just ahead of the guidance of 2% we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We are pleased with the sales results throughout the quarter, but they were particularly strong in March as weather warmed and Easter timing moved Seasonal sales into the month. 
Comparable sales growth for March and April combined, which eliminates the effect of the Easter timing, was stronger than we experienced in February. Digital channels sales increased 38% in the first quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the first quarter last year. Digital channels drove about 80 basis points of our first quarter comparable sales increase, in line with our fourth quarter experience. 
Comparable transactions were up, both in the store and digital channels, accounting for approximately 90 basis points of our comp increase. REDcard penetration of 21.5% was about 110 basis points ahead of last year, in line with our expectations. This growth is faster than our fourth quarter pace and consistent with new account growth in the latter half of 2014. 
Risk levels in the portfolio continue to run at historically low levels, and this quarter we saw an increase in payment rates. This increase is consistent with commentary from others and potentially explains what consumers are choosing to do with some of their savings from lower gas prices. 
One other note. We've now begun piloting acceptance of chip transactions at our stores as the entire U.S. payment industry prepares to move to chip technology later in the year. 
Our first quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.5% was stronger than expected, driven by unexpectedly strong gross margin rate. Specifically, our first quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was nearly 1 percentage point higher than a year ago. This rate -- this year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we analyzed -- annualized the last year's promotional activity following the data breach, and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature category. 
In fact, the last 2 quarters are the only 2 in recent history in which sales mix has been a positive contributor to our overall gross margin rate. This shows the value of our focus on driving growth in our signature category. 
This quarter, we grew sales and traffic while replacing promotionally driven sales on lower-margin items with higher-margin sales in signature categories, and the benefit to our P&L was compelling. 
On the SG&A expense line, this quarter, we benefited from productivity improvement in the stores and overall leverage of benefits, partially offset by higher technology expense compared with a year ago. Altogether, our first quarter segment SG&A expense rate improved about 20 basis points compared with last year. 
Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 9% higher than a year ago. This increase was intentional and reflects some decisions we've discussed in the past calls. 
First, beginning last summer, we increased our inventory commitment in commodity categories to support in-stocks in these frequency driving businesses; and second, our receipts this quarter reflected some pre-buying of imported products that the team had undertaken to mitigate risk before the West Coast port slowdown had been resolved. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about our overall inventory level, and we expect year-over-year growth to moderate in the second quarter and beyond. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. First quarter interest expense was essentially flat to last year, and we returned $333 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. 
As we mentioned during the last call, the improvements in our business results and cash balance had positioned us to once again return cash through share repurchase within limits of our capital structure goals. As a result, this quarter, we bought back shares for the first time since the second quarter 2013, investing $297 million in open-market repurchases and another $265 million through an accelerated share repurchase agreement late in the quarter. 
This means that in the quarter, we returned over 140% of our net income through dividends and share repurchase. Given our current cash position and continued strong cash generation by our business, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter and beyond and believe we will have the capacity to retire $2 billion or more of our shares in this fiscal year, within the limits of our current investment grade ratings. 
One note. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, meaning that if this activity continues as expected, we would exhaust the current authorization later this year. As a result, we will be reviewing with our board the need to increase our share repurchase authorization at an upcoming meeting. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss our decision to begin reporting after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations or ROIC in this quarter's earnings press release. As you know from our previous discussions and the long-term performance incentives described in our proxy statement, we believe ROIC is an important metric to measure the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. 
Also, as you know, we presented our long-term aspirations for this metric during our financial community meeting in March. Specifically, we intend to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next 5 years. 
Beginning this quarter, we will report how we performed on this metric for the most recent trailing 12 months, providing clarity on how we are measuring our own performance while allowing everyone to track our progress. To provide additional context, we're posting the last 2 years of quarterly calculation to this metric on our Investor Relations website in the summary financial section. 
With that backdrop, this morning, we reported that for the trailing 12 months through first quarter 2015, our after-tax return on invested capital was 12.5%, up about 60 basis points from a year before, reflecting improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital in our continuing operations. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we expect our comparable sales to increase between 2% and 2.5%, reflecting expected growth in digital channel sales in the high 30% range. Both of these expectations are similar to our first quarter performance. And while it is still early, our results through the first few weeks of the second quarter are consistent with that forecast. 
We expect our second quarter gross margin rate to improve about 50 basis points from last year as we benefit from the comparison to last year's promotional activity while we continue to make price investments and add quality back into our own and exclusive brand products. 
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our second quarter rate will be 20 to 30 basis points higher than a year ago as the rate benefit from productivity improvement is expected to be offset by a planned year-over-year increase in compensation expense. You'll recall that compensation expense was unusually low in the second quarter last year as we significantly reduced our accrual for full year incentive compensation in light of softening financial performance. 
Combining our gross margin and expense rate expectations, we're looking for improvement in our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year. Second quarter interest expense is expected to be about $150 million, well below last year, which is unusually -- which was unusually high due to the retirement of some high coupon debt. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be just over 35%, higher than last year's 33.7% rate, driven by improved profitability. Altogether, these expectations would lead to second quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business, of $1.04 to $1.14 compared with $1.01 a year ago. 
While we've seen a strong start to the year so far, it is early, and we have a lot more to accomplish as the year progresses. However, our first quarter performance validates that we are focused on the right strategic priorities to propel our business forward. And it certainly adds to our confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for the year. 
As a result, we've taken the lower end of our prior full year guidance up by $0.05, and now we expect full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $4.50 to $4.65. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now, Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Comp sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectations. This increase was driven by a healthy balance of growth in both traffic and average ticket. 
First quarter digital sales increased 38% over last year, driven by higher traffic and a substantial increase in conversions. Digital growth contributed 80 basis points to our comp sales increase in the first quarter. 
While we enjoyed a healthy pace of sales throughout the first quarter, we saw particularly strong results in March as weather warmed across many parts of the country and Easter timing moved Seasonal sales into the month. In April, we were thrilled with the overall demand for items on our collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer, with most of the collection selling out in the first few days. 
We were disappointed, however, that our digital channels were not able to properly accommodate the surge in traffic at the time of the launch, and the team is working to address root causes and learn from the experience as we prepare for holiday season peak later this year. 
The first quarter saw a meaningful increase in our gross margin rate as we've cycled over a promotional first quarter of 2014, and we benefited from very strong mix of sales in our signature categories this year, both in stores and online. 
First quarter comp sales in signature categories grew more than twice as fast as our comparable sales overall, and mix in our digital channels was even stronger. Specifically, about 2/3 of our first quarter digital sales increase was driven by growth in Home and Apparel. Kathee will provide more detail on category performance in a few minutes. 
Once again, our stores did a great job controlling costs this quarter, while outside of the stores, we continue to move to a leaner, more agile way of working. 
During the first quarter, we recorded restructuring charges related to headcount reductions at our headquarters. While these reductions were very difficult for all of us, I strongly believe that they were a necessary step to remove roadblocks, which were preventing us from moving more quickly and responsibly to the guest needs. 
I want to thank the team for their perseverance during this time of significant transition. I continue to admire the energy they bring to work every single day. 
As you know, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over time, and I'm very pleased that this quarter, we began returning cash through share repurchase for the first time in nearly 2 years. This change reflects the improving health of our U.S. business, along with the cash flow benefit of our fourth quarter decision to discontinue operations in Canada. 
For several quarters now, I've been talking about the 5 priorities we are focused on as a leadership team: becoming a leader in delivering shopping on demand for our guests; establishing clear roles in our merchandising categories, with particular focus on growing our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness; developing capabilities to become more localized in our store experience and more personalized in our digital interaction with guests; continue to develop and test urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress; and finally, transforming the way we work to create capacity to invest appropriately in the growth initiatives I just described. 
I strongly believe if we make progress on these 5 priorities over the next few years, Target will deliver outstanding financial results and become an even stronger retailer. While we're at the early stages, I'm encouraged with signs of progress on these efforts. 
Specifically, our strong mix of first quarter sales in signature categories demonstrates the value of the work to define category roles. We continue to roll out upgraded fixtures in Apparel, Beauty, Baby and Home while investing in Wellness with programs like ""Made to Matter."" 
Our buying teams are focused on delivering enhanced newness, quality and value to our guests, and we're communicating this renewed focus in both traditional and digital channels. 
Our digital sales growth of nearly 40% on top of 30% growth a year ago shows that we have a meaningful opportunity to generate comp sales growth through investments in digital channels. And following our March headcount reductions at headquarters, our teams are taking a fresh look at everything we do and taking steps to remove approval layers and increase the speed of decision-making. 
While there will certainly be a meaningful adjustment process, I believe we will emerge with an agile and engaged team that is equipped and empowered to act quickly on behalf of the guests. 
These signs of progress are meaningful to the team and they demonstrate the value of our efforts and validate our strategic priorities. Yet as we look ahead, we realize we're on a much longer journey and we need to accomplish many more things. Specifically, we're in the very early stages of our work on localization and personalization. In the future, these efforts should benefit both sales and gross margin rate. 
And while we're still in the testing phase, we're very encouraged by the progress in evaluating and rolling out urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress. We opened 2 new Express locations in the San Francisco market this quarter, both of which are quite different from our first location in the Minneapolis market. We expect to open 6 more locations this year in a variety of markets and demographic areas to continue to learn how to operate this new format in a diverse array of sizes and settings. 
Finally, we are just beginning to reinvent our Food assortment and presentation. We have an opportunity to drive more traffic and sales in this critical area of the store by becoming more specialized in our assortment, more focused on healthy options in support of wellness. We're testing potential assortment and presentation options, and this year, we plan to study the guest response to potential changes before determining what we'll roll out more extensively next year. 
While this quarter's results are encouraging, we're focused on the work ahead of us as we transform ourselves to become a truly modern retailer and more relevant to our guests. We're taking the necessary steps, both on our investment decisions and the way we work, to position Target for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. 
The momentum we've seen so far makes us more confident than ever that we're moving in the right direction and encourages us to move even faster. Yet we know that long-term success depends on achieving the right balance between speed and the time it takes to confirm we're making the right changes that we can execute at scale. Once we have that confirmation, we're committed to moving forward, both quickly and confidently, in becoming the retailer our guests want Target to be. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kathee to recap our first quarter results and plans going forward."

Within our sales, our results reflect our",1252,"Thanks, Brian. In the first quarter, we saw encouraging trends across many dimensions of our business, including traffic, sales, merchandise mix, markdown rates, digital channel growth and overall profitability. 
Within our sales, our results reflect our continued focus on growing signature categories. Beauty had another outstanding quarter and delivered more than a 5% comp, but Apparel and Home were right behind with a mid-4% comp. 
Given weather trends and Easter timing, Apparel comps peaked in March but were strong throughout the quarter. Among the drivers was swim, where we saw better-than-expected results across the board in women's, men's and kids. 
In ready-to-wear, we saw particular strength in Merona and our new plus-size brand, Ava & Viv. And while it's small relative to the quarter, the response to the Lilly Pulitzer partnership was the icing on the cake as more than 90% of the Apparel items sold out the first day. 
Across the rest of our assortment, Food comps were just below the company average, and Hardlines experienced a mid-single-digit comp decline, reflecting a very tough comparison to last year when we saw particularly strong sales from Disney's Frozen, and elevated promotions drove sales in Electronics. 
As Brian mentioned, first quarter comparable sales were driven by a healthy combination of growth in both traffic and average ticket. Within average ticket, an increase in average retail was partially offset by a decline in units per transaction. This decline in average units was driven by category mix, particularly Apparel, along with channel mix as digital transactions typically have fewer units at higher average retails. 
Besides channel mix, growth in average retail was driven by a lower level of promotional activity this year and a trend in which our guests are trading up to higher-quality and premium-branded items. 
We were really pleased with the pace of digital channel sales growth this quarter and even happier that it was driven by Home and Apparel. But our digital goals are ambitious and we have a lot more work to do, so we're continuing to invest in and roll out new initiatives to maintain our momentum. 
The February launch of a lower $25 free shipping threshold drove a meaningful increase in conversion this quarter, and guests continued to embrace Store Pickup, which was up more than 100% from a year ago. 
Subscriptions are also growing rapidly. Sales on subscription grew 32% between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and the active subscriber base grew 20% within the first quarter. And we continue to see great results from our ship-from-store capability, which delivered shipping savings for us and reduced delivery times for our guests. And we expect to roll out this capability to more than 200 additional stores this fall. 
As I mentioned in the last call, we were very happy to see the West Coast port situation resolved, yet we knew it would take a few months for the shipping backlog to be completely relieved. As of today, I'm pleased to say that those delays are fully behind us. 
Consistent with our fourth quarter experience, the team did a great job in the first quarter working around port-related issues by preordering inventory and rerouting shipments. However, despite these efforts, some categories, including Shoes, saw spotty in-stocks in the quarter and saw sales accelerate as receipts began to flow and in-stocks recovered. 
As we look ahead, we are working to build on our current momentum in the second quarter and beyond. In Apparel, beyond swim, we've been seeing encouraging trends in shorts, dresses, tanks and sandals and expect these businesses to be a key driver of second quarter sales. 
In Jewelry and Accessories, this morning, we announced a new limited time partnership, Eddie Borgo for Target, which launches -- that launches July 12. Eddie has crafted a first-of-its-kind limited edition collection of customizable jewelry, accessories and wall art featuring the designer's signature aesthetic and on-trend colors and finishes. 
In Home, we're seeing great momentum in our tabletop business, and we'll expand the offering this quarter with a broader selection of both indoor and outdoor options for summer entertaining. We're also excited

programs, which will launch in July, featuring more exclusive content from licensed and exclusive brands and do-it-yourself programs, which will allow students to decorate their own journals, notebooks and lockers. 
In Wellness, we continue to see amazing results from the ""Made to Matter"" collection. Since the announcement of this collection, featured brands are running up 25% to last year, and the collection is on track to record $1 billion in sales this year. 
And in Kids, we have a blockbuster set of licensed programs planned for the second quarter and beyond. In stores now, we're offering about 150 items from the new Avengers movie, including many that are exclusive to Target. 
To support the release, we've created an omni-channel marketing campaign that includes social media engagement and a uniquely creative stop-motion broadcast spot that brings the actual 12-inch action figures to life. 
Also, this summer looks for exclusive items across multiple categories in celebration of the June release of Jurassic World and the July release of Minions. 
On target.com, we've expanded our licensed offering by creating experiences for our top 29 licenses. Each of these experiences includes favorite items that we carry in both channels, plus expanded -- extended assortments that include collectibles, more apparel choices and hard-to-find toys. We will continue to roll out experiences to more of our favorite characters throughout the year. 
To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the iconic comic strip, Peanuts, we're rolling out a summer collection of more than 100 exclusive products. These items are the work of our own product design and development team who partnered with current Peanuts cartoonists and the Charles M. Schulz Museum to design fresh, fun items that are true to the comic strip's roots. We'll roll out more exclusive items across multiple categories throughout the year, leading up to the release of the new Peanuts feature film in November. 
And finally, like moviegoers, we're already excited about the December movie release from the most famous license of them all, Star Wars. Earlier this month, as part of the worldwide ""May the 4th be with you"" event, we allowed Darth Vader and Yoda to take over the target.com homepage, offering special online-only deals on Star Wars licensed product. We'll provide more details on our next earnings call, but for now, I can assure you that Star Wars fans will find plenty of reasons to visit our stores and target.com this year. 
As we said many times, we're encouraged by our progress but recognize that we are only at the beginning of a multiyear journey to transform our business. We continue to roll out new store fixtures to enhance the shopping experience in Apparel, Baby, Electronics and Home, and we're working quickly to develop and test ideas to reinvent our Food area to become more specialized and more clearly embrace wellness with local products, naturals, organics and clean labels. And we continue to invest in our technology and supply chain capabilities to allow our guests to shop on demand and receive products where and when they want. 
The good news is that even though we have much more to do, the positive guest response to what we've already accomplished makes us confident we are moving in the right direction. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and beyond."
174438,290179418,820053,"Target Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance, particularly in our signature categories. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high end of the guidance range provide",1560,"Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance, particularly in our signature categories. 
Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.01, about $0.09 lower than adjusted EPS, driven primarily by pretax restructuring cost of $103 million combined with small adjustments for breach-related expenses and a favorable resolution of income tax matters. 
First quarter GAAP EPS of $0.98 included a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.24 loss on Canadian operations in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 2.3% was just ahead of the guidance of 2% we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We are pleased with the sales results throughout the quarter, but they were particularly strong in March as weather warmed and Easter timing moved Seasonal sales into the month. 
Comparable sales growth for March and April combined, which eliminates the effect of the Easter timing, was stronger than we experienced in February. Digital channel sales increased 38% in the first quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the first quarter last year. Digital channels drove about 80 basis points of our first quarter comparable sales increase, in line with our fourth quarter experience. 
Comparable transactions were up, both in the store and digital channels, accounting for approximately 90 basis points of our comp increase. REDcard penetration of 21.5% was about 110 basis points ahead of last year, in line with our expectations. This growth is faster than our fourth quarter pace and consistent with new account growth in the latter half of 2014. 
Risk levels on the portfolio continue to run at historically low levels, and this quarter we saw an increase in payment rates. This increase is consistent with commentary from others and potentially explains what consumers are choosing to do with some of their savings from lower gas prices. 
One other note. We've now begun piloting acceptance of chip transactions at our stores as the entire U.S. payment industry prepares to move to chip technology later in the year. 
Our first quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.5% was stronger than expected, driven by an unexpectedly strong gross margin rate. Specifically, our first quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was nearly 1 percentage point higher than a year ago. This rate -- this year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we analyzed -- annualized last year's promotional activity following the data breach, and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature category. 
In fact, the last 2 quarters are the only 2 in recent history in which sales mix has been a positive contributor to our overall gross margin rate. This shows the value of our focus on driving growth in our signature category. 
This quarter, we grew sales and traffic while replacing promotionally driven sales on lower-margin items with higher-margin sales in signature categories, and the benefit to our P&L was compelling. 
On the SG&A expense line, this quarter, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage of paying benefits, partially offset by higher technology expense compared with a year ago. Altogether, our first quarter segment SG&A expense rate improved about 20 basis points compared with last year. 
Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 9% higher than a year ago. This increase was intentional and reflects some decisions we've discussed in the past calls. 
First, beginning last summer, we increased our inventory commitment in commodity categories to support in-stocks in these frequency-driving businesses. And second, our receipts this quarter reflected some pre-buying of imported product that the team had undertaken to mitigate risk before the West Coast port slowdown had been resolved. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about our overall inventory level and we expect year-over-year growth to moderate in the second quarter and beyond. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. First quarter interest expense was essentially flat to last year, and we returned $333 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. 
As we mentioned during the last call, the improvements in our business results and cash balance had positioned us to once again return cash through share repurchase within the limits of our capital structure goals. As a result, this quarter, we bought back shares for the first time since the second quarter of 2013, investing $297 million in open-market repurchases and another $265 million through an accelerated share repurchase agreement late in the quarter. 
This means that in the quarter, we returned over 140% of our net income through dividends and share repurchase. Given our current cash position and continued strong cash generation by our business, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter and beyond and believe we will have the capacity to retire $2 billion or more of our shares in this fiscal year, within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
One note. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, meaning that if this activity continues as expected, we would exhaust the current authorization later this year. As a result, we will be reviewing with our board the need to increase our share repurchase authorization at an upcoming meeting. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss our decision to begin reporting after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations or ROIC in this quarter's earnings press release. As you know from our previous discussions and the long-term performance incentives described in our proxy statement, we believe ROIC is an important metric to measure the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. 
Also, as you know, we presented our long-term aspirations for this metric during our financial community meeting in March. Specifically, we intend to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next 5 years. 
Beginning this quarter, we will report how we have performed on this metric for the most recent trailing 12 months, providing clarity on how we are measuring our own performance while allowing everyone to track our progress. To provide additional context, we're posting the last 2 years of quarterly calculations with this metric on our Investor Relations website in the Summary Financials section. 
With that backdrop, this morning, we reported that for the trailing 12 months through first quarter 2015, our after-tax return on invested capital was 12.5%, up about 60 basis points from a year before, reflecting improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital in our continuing operations. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we expect our comparable sales to increase between 2% and 2.5%, reflecting expected growth in digital channel sales in the high 30% range. Both of these expectations are similar to our first quarter performance. And while it is still early, our results through the first few weeks of the second quarter are consistent with that forecast. 
We expect our second quarter gross margin rate to improve about 50 basis points from last year as we benefit from the comparison to last year's promotional activity while we continue to make price investments and add quality back into our owned and exclusive brand products. 
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our second quarter rate will be 20 to 30 basis points higher than a year ago as the rate benefit from productivity improvement is expected to be offset by a planned year-over-year increase in compensation expense. You'll recall that compensation expense was unusually low in the second quarter last year as we significantly reduced our accrual for full year incentive compensation in light of softening financial performance. 
Combining our gross margin and expense rate expectations, we're looking for improvement in our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year. Second quarter interest expense is expected to be about $150 million, well below last year, which is unusually -- which was unusually high due to the retirement of some high coupon debt. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be just over 35%, higher than last year's 33.7% rate, driven by improved profitability. Altogether, these expectations would lead to second quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business, of $1.04 to $1.14 compared with $1.01 a year ago. 
While we've seen a strong start to the year so far, it is early and we have a lot more to accomplish as the year progresses. However, our first quarter performance validates that we are focused on the right strategic priorities to propel our business forward. And it certainly adds to our confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for the year. 
As a result, we've taken the lower end of our prior full year guidance up by $0.05 and now expect full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $4.50 to $4.65. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

They recognize those brands are at Target, and they love to buy them, but they come looking for those new exclusive, really innovative products.

We're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high end",1202,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Comp sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectations. This increase was driven by a healthy balance of growth in both traffic and average ticket. 
First quarter digital sales increased 38% over last year, driven by higher traffic and a substantial increase in conversions. Digital growth contributed 80 basis points to our comp sales increase in the first quarter. 
While we enjoyed a healthy pace of sales throughout the first quarter, we saw particularly strong results in March as weather warmed across many parts of the country and Easter timing moved Seasonal sales into the month. In April, we were thrilled with the overwhelming demand for items on our collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer, with most of the collection selling out in the first few days. 
We were disappointed, however, that our digital channels were not able to properly accommodate the surge in traffic at the time of the launch, and the team is working to address root causes and learn from the experience as we prepare for holiday season peak later this year. 
The first quarter saw a meaningful increase in our gross margin rate as we've cycled over a promotional first quarter 2014, and we benefited from very strong mix of sales in our signature categories this year, both in stores and online. 
First quarter comp sales in signature categories grew more than twice as fast as our comparable sales overall, and mix in our digital channels was even stronger. Specifically, about 2/3 of our first quarter digital sales increase was driven by growth in Home and Apparel. Kathee will provide more detail on category performance in a few minutes. 
Once again, our stores did a great job controlling costs this quarter, while outside of the stores, we continue to move to a leaner, more agile way of working. 
During the first quarter, we recorded restructuring charges related to headcount reductions at our headquarters. While these reductions were very difficult for all of us, I strongly believe they were a necessary step to remove roadblocks, which were preventing us from moving more quickly and responsively to the guest needs. 
I want to thank the team for their perseverance during this time of significant transition. I continue to admire the energy they bring to work every single day. 
As you know, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over time, and I'm very pleased that this quarter, we began returning cash through share repurchase for the first time in nearly 2 years. This change reflects the improving health of our U.S. business, along with the cash flow benefit of our fourth quarter decision to discontinue operations in Canada. 
For several quarters now, I've been talking about the 5 priorities we are focused on as a leadership team: becoming a leader in delivering shopping on demand for our guests; establishing clear roles in our merchandising categories, with particular focus on growing our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness; developing capabilities to become more localized in our store experience and more personalized in our digital interaction with guests; continue to develop and test urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress; and finally, transforming the way we work to create capacity to invest appropriately in the growth initiatives I just described. 
I strongly believe if we make progress on these 5 priorities over the next few years, Target will deliver outstanding financial results and become an even stronger retailer. While we're at the early stages, I'm encouraged with signs of progress on these efforts. 
Specifically, our strong mix of first quarter sales in signature categories demonstrates the value of the work to define category roles. We continue to roll out upgraded fixtures in Apparel, Beauty, Baby and Home while investing in Wellness with programs like ""Made to Matter."" 
Our buying teams are focused on delivering enhanced newness, quality and value to our guests, and we're communicating this renewed focus in both traditional and digital channels. 
Our digital sales growth of nearly 40%, on top of 30% growth a year ago, shows that we have a meaningful opportunity to generate comp sales growth through investments in digital channels. And following our March headcount reductions at headquarters, our teams are taking a fresh look at everything we do and taking steps to remove approval layers and increase the speed of decision-making. 
While there will certainly be a meaningful adjustment process, I believe we will emerge with an agile and engaged team that is equipped and empowered to act quickly on behalf of the guests. 
These signs of progress are meaningful to the team and they demonstrate the value of our efforts and validate our strategic priorities. Yet as we look ahead, we realize we're on a much longer journey and need to accomplish many more things. Specifically, we're in the very early stages of our work on localization and personalization. In the future, these efforts should benefit both sales and gross margin rate. 
And while we're still in the testing phase, we're very encouraged by the progress in evaluating and rolling out urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress. We opened 2 new Express locations in the San Francisco market this quarter, both of which are quite different from our first location in the Minneapolis market. We expect to open 6 more locations this year in a variety of markets and demographic areas to continue to learn how to operate this new format in a diverse array of sizes and settings. 
Finally, we are just beginning to reinvent our Food assortment and presentation. We have an opportunity to drive more traffic and sales in this critical area of the store by becoming more specialized in our assortment, more focused on healthy options in support of wellness. We're testing potential assortment and presentation options, and this year, we plan to study the guest response to potential changes before determining what we'll roll out more extensively next year. 
While this quarter's results are encouraging, we're focused on the work ahead of us as we transform ourselves to become a truly modern retailer and more relevant to our guests. We're taking the necessary steps, both on our investment decisions and the way we work, to position Target for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. 
The momentum we've seen so far makes us more confident than ever that we're moving in the right direction and encourages us to move even faster. Yet we know that long-term success depends on achieving the right balance between speed and the time it takes to confirm we're making the right changes that we can execute at scale. Once we have that confirmation, we're committed to moving forward, both quickly and confidently, in becoming the retailer our guests want Target to be. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kathee to recap our first quarter results and plans going forward."

In the first quarter, we saw encouraging trends across many dimensions of our business, including traffic, sales, merchandise mix, markdown rates, digital channel growth and overall profitability. Within our sales, our results reflect our",1252,"Thanks, Brian. In the first quarter, we saw encouraging trends across many dimensions of our business, including traffic, sales, merchandise mix, markdown rates, digital channel growth and overall profitability. 
Within our sales, our results reflect our continued focus on growing signature categories. Beauty had another outstanding quarter and delivered more than a 5% comp, but Apparel and Home were right behind with a mid-4% comp. 
Given weather trends and Easter timing, Apparel comps peaked in March but were strong throughout the quarter. Among the drivers was swim, where we saw better-than-expected results across the board in women's, men's and kids. 
In ready-to-wear, we saw particular strength in Merona and our new plus-size brand, Ava & Viv. And while it's small relative to the quarter, the response to the Lilly Pulitzer partnership was the icing on the cake as more than 90% of the Apparel items sold out the first day. 
Across the rest of our assortment, Food comps were just below the company average, and Hardlines experienced a mid-single-digit comp decline, reflecting a very tough comparison to last year when we saw particularly strong sales from Disney's Frozen, and elevated promotions drove sales in Electronics. 
As Brian mentioned, first quarter comparable sales were driven by a healthy combination of growth in both traffic and average ticket. Within average ticket, an increase in average retail was partially offset by a decline in units per transaction. This decline in average units was driven by category mix, particularly Apparel, along with channel mix as digital transactions typically have fewer units at higher average retail. 
Besides channel mix, growth in average retail was driven by a lower level of promotional activity this year and a trend in which our guests are trading up to higher-quality and premium-branded items. 
We were really pleased with the pace of digital channel sales growth this quarter and even happier that it was driven by Home and Apparel. But our digital goals are ambitious and we have a lot more work to do, so we're continuing to invest in and roll out new initiatives to maintain our momentum. 
The February launch of a lower $25 free shipping threshold drove a meaningful increase in conversion this quarter, and guests continued to embrace Store Pickup, which was up more than 100% from a year ago. 
Subscriptions are also growing rapidly. Sales on subscription grew 32% between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and the active subscriber base grew 20% within the first quarter. And we continue to see great results from our ship-from-store capability, which delivers shipping savings for us and reduced delivery times for our guests. And we expect to roll out this capability to more than 200 additional stores this fall. 
As I mentioned in the last call, we were very happy to see the West Coast port situation resolved, yet we knew it would take a few months for the shipping backlog to be completely relieved. As of today, I'm pleased to say that those delays are fully behind us. 
Consistent with our fourth quarter experience, the team did a great job in the first quarter working around port-related issues by preordering inventory and rerouting shipments. However, despite these efforts, some categories, including Shoes, saw spotty in-stocks in the quarter and saw sales accelerate as receipts began to flow and in-stocks recovered. 
As we look ahead, we are working to build on our current momentum in the second quarter and beyond. In Apparel, beyond swim, we've been seeing encouraging trends in shorts, dresses, tanks and sandals and expect these businesses to be a key driver of second quarter sales. 
In Jewelry and Accessories, this morning, we announced a new limited time partnership, Eddie Borgo for Target, which launches -- that launches July 12. Eddie has crafted a first-of-its-kind limited edition collection of customizable jewelry, accessories and wall art featuring the designer's signature aesthetic and on-trend colors and finishes. 
In Home, we're seeing great momentum in our tabletop business, and we'll expand the offering this quarter with a broader selection of both indoor and outdoor options for summer entertaining. We're also excited

programs, which will launch in July, featuring more exclusive content from licensed and exclusive brands and do-it-yourself programs, which will allow students to decorate their own journals, notebooks and lockers. 
In Wellness, we continue to see amazing results from the ""Made to Matter"" collection. Since the announcement of this collection, featured brands are running up 25% to last year, and the collection is on track to record $1 billion in sales this year. 
And in Kids, we have a blockbuster set of licensed programs planned for the second quarter and beyond. In stores now, we're offering about 150 items from the new Avengers movie, including many that are exclusive to Target. 
To support the release, we've created an omnichannel marketing campaign that includes social media engagement and a uniquely creative stop-motion broadcast spot that brings the actual 12-inch action figures to life. 
Also, this summer looks for exclusive items across multiple categories in celebration of the June release of Jurassic World and the July release of Minions. 
On target.com, we've expanded our licensed offering by creating experiences for our top 29 licenses. Each of these experiences includes favorite items that we carry in both channels, plus expanded -- extended assortments that include collectibles, more apparel choices and hard-to-find toys. We will continue to roll out experiences to more of our favorite characters throughout the year. 
To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the iconic comic strip, Peanuts, we're rolling out a summer collection of more than 100 exclusive products. These items are the work of our own product design and development team who partnered with current Peanuts cartoonists and the Charles M. Schulz Museum to design fresh, fun items that are true to the comic strip's roots. We'll roll out more exclusive items across multiple categories throughout the year, leading up to the release of the new Peanuts feature film in November. 
And finally, like moviegoers, we're already excited about the December movie release from the most famous license of them all, Star Wars. Earlier this month, as part of the worldwide ""May the 4th be with you"" event, we allowed Darth Vader and Yoda to take over the target.com homepage, offering special online-only deals on Star Wars licensed product. We'll provide more details on our next earnings call, but for now, I can assure you that Star Wars fans will find plenty of reasons to visit our stores and target.com this year. 
As we've said many times, we're encouraged by our progress but recognize that we are only at the beginning of a multiyear journey to transform our business. We continue to roll out new store fixtures to enhance the shopping experience in Apparel, Baby, Electronics and Home, and we're working quickly to develop and test ideas to reinvent our Food area to become more specialized and more clearly embrace wellness with local products, naturals, organics and clean labels. And we continue to invest in our technology and supply chain capabilities to allow our guests to shop on demand and receive products where and when they want. 
The good news is that even though we have much more to do, the positive guest response to what we've already accomplished makes us confident we are moving in the right direction. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and beyond."
174438,290179418,820253,"Target Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance, particularly in our signature categories. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high end of the guidance range provide",1561,"Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance, particularly in our signature categories. 
Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.01, about $0.09 lower than adjusted EPS, driven primarily by pretax restructuring cost of $103 million combined with small adjustments for breach-related expenses and a favorable resolution of income tax matters. 
First quarter GAAP EPS of $0.98 included a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.24 loss on Canadian operations in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 2.3% was just ahead of the guidance of 2% we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We are pleased with the sales results throughout the quarter, but they were particularly strong in March as weather warmed and Easter timing moved Seasonal sales into the month. 
Comparable sales growth for March and April combined, which eliminates the effect of the Easter timing, was stronger than we experienced in February. Digital channel sales increased 38% in the first quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the first quarter last year. Digital channels drove about 80 basis points of our first quarter comparable sales increase, in line with our fourth quarter experience. 
Comparable transactions were up, both in the store and digital channels, accounting for approximately 90 basis points of our comp increase. REDcard penetration of 21.5% was about 110 basis points ahead of last year, in line with our expectations. This growth is faster than our fourth quarter pace and consistent with new account growth in the latter half of 2014. 
Risk levels on the portfolio continue to run at historically low levels, and this quarter we saw an increase in payment rates. This increase is consistent with commentary from others and potentially explains what consumers are choosing to do with some of their savings from lower gas prices. 
One other note. We've now begun piloting acceptance of chip transactions at our stores as the entire U.S. payment industry prepares to move to chip technology later in the year. 
Our first quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.5% was stronger than expected, driven by an unexpectedly strong gross margin rate. Specifically, our first quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was nearly 1 percentage point higher than a year ago. This rate -- this year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we analyzed -- annualized last year's promotional activity following the data breach, and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature category. 
In fact, the last 2 quarters are the only 2 in recent history in which sales mix has been a positive contributor to our overall gross margin rate. This shows the value of our focus on driving growth in our signature category. 
This quarter, we grew sales and traffic while replacing promotionally driven sales on lower-margin items with higher-margin sales in signature categories, and the benefit to our P&L was compelling. 
On the SG&A expense line, this quarter, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage of pay and benefits, partially offset by higher technology expense compared with a year ago. Altogether, our first quarter segment SG&A expense rate improved about 20 basis points compared with last year. 
Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 9% higher than a year ago. This increase was intentional and reflects some decisions we've discussed in the past calls. 
First, beginning last summer, we increased our inventory commitment in commodity categories to support in-stocks in these frequency-driving businesses. And second, our receipts this quarter reflected some pre-buying of imported product that the team had undertaken to mitigate risk before the West Coast port slowdown had been resolved. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about our overall inventory level and we expect year-over-year growth to moderate in the second quarter and beyond. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. First quarter interest expense was essentially flat to last year, and we returned $333 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. 
As we mentioned during the last call, the improvements in our business results and cash balance have positioned us to once again return cash through share repurchase within the limits of our capital structure goals. As a result, this quarter, we bought back shares for the first time since the second quarter of 2013, investing $297 million in open-market repurchases and another $265 million through an accelerated share repurchase agreement late in the quarter. 
This means that in the quarter, we returned over 140% of our net income through dividends and share repurchase. Given our current cash position and continued strong cash generation by our business, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter and beyond and believe we will have the capacity to retire $2 billion or more of our shares in this fiscal year, within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
One note. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, meaning that if this activity continues as expected, we would exhaust the current authorization later this year. As a result, we will be reviewing with our board the need to increase our share repurchase authorization at an upcoming meeting. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss our decision to begin reporting after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, or ROIC, in this quarter's earnings press release. As you know from our previous discussions and the long-term performance incentives described in our proxy statement, we believe ROIC is an important metric to measure the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. 
Also, as you know, we presented our long-term aspirations for this metric during our financial community meeting in March. Specifically, we intend to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next 5 years. 
Beginning this quarter, we will report how we have performed on this metric for the most recent trailing 12 months, providing clarity on how we are measuring our own performance while allowing everyone to track our progress. To provide additional context, we're posting the last 2 years of quarterly calculations of this metric on our Investor Relations website in the Summary Financials section. 
With that backdrop, this morning, we reported that for the trailing 12 months through first quarter 2015, our after-tax return on invested capital was 12.5%, up about 60 basis points from a year before, reflecting improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital in our continuing operations. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we expect our comparable sales to increase between 2% and 2.5%, reflecting expected growth in digital channel sales in the high 30% range. Both of these expectations are similar to our first quarter performance. And while it is still early, our results through the first few weeks of the second quarter are consistent with that forecast. 
We expect our second quarter gross margin rate to improve about 50 basis points from last year as we benefit from the comparison to last year's promotional activity while we continue to make price investments and add quality back into our owned and exclusive brand products. 
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our second quarter rate will be 20 to 30 basis points higher than a year ago as the rate benefit from productivity improvement is expected to be offset by a planned year-over-year increase in compensation expense. You'll recall that compensation expense was unusually low in the second quarter last year as we significantly reduced our accrual for full year incentive compensation in light of softening financial performance. 
Combining our gross margin and expense rate expectations, we're looking for improvement in our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year. Second quarter interest expense is expected to be about $150 million, well below last year, which is unusually -- which was unusually high due to the retirement of some high coupon debt. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be just over 35%, higher than last year's 33.7% rate, driven by improved profitability. Altogether, these expectations would lead to second quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business, of $1.04 to $1.14 compared with $1.01 a year ago. 
While we've seen a strong start to the year so far, it is early and we have a lot more to accomplish as the year progresses. However, our first quarter performance validates that we are focused on the right strategic priorities to propel our business forward. And it certainly adds to our confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for the year. 
As a result, we've taken the lower end of our prior full year guidance up by $0.05 and now expect full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $4.50 to $4.65. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

So we believe those categories both in store but, importantly, as we demonstrated in Q1, online, where a significant portion of our growth in the digital channel was driven by Apparel and Home.

Despite some of the port challenges, our supply chain teams did an outstanding job of making sure that we had inventory in place for the guests. I was very pleased with our marketing program. And if you haven't seen the Target Style campaign or some of the things we just did for Avengers, it's spectacular advertising and the guest is responding to it. And our store teams just did a phenomenal job throughout the quarter, despite port challenges and weather challenges, in providing the guest with a good experience, and it added up to really solid results in Q1. So we hope that continues. We're confident it's going to continue throughout the year.

We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of t",2452,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. 
We are also pleased that once again this quarter, we are able to grow traffic and sales, both in stores and in the digital channels even as we were cycling over a very promotional second quarter from last year. 
Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our expectations. Notably, about 2/3 of this comp increase was driven by growth in traffic combined with a smaller increase in average ticket. Second quarter digital sales grew 30% from a year ago, slightly below our expectations as we compared against a very intense digital channel promotions last year. 
Digital growth contributed about 60 basis points to our comp sales growth this quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 0.5% higher than last year as we continue to benefit from a favorable merchandise mix and the comparison over last year's promotional markdowns. 
On the SG&A expense line, we had an unexpectedly strong quarter as we benefited from discipline throughout the organization, along with the impact of expense timing as John will cover in a few minutes. 
With these results, we continue to benefit from very strong cash generation by our core business, which enabled us to return a combined $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchases. 
As we've outlined in the last several quarters, we're working to define clear roles for each of our merchandise categories and devoting resources to growing what we call our signature categories, Style, which includes the majority of apparel, home and beauty categories along with baby, Kids and Wellness. While we're still in the early days of this work, we're already seeing a compelling benefit from our efforts. Specifically, comp sales in signature categories grew more than 7% in the second quarter, 3x our overall comp growth.
This performance represents an acceleration from the first quarter when comp growth in signature categories was about double Target's overall comp growth. With strong signature category performance, comps in both home and apparel were in the 4% to 5% range this quarter. In apparel, results were strongest in baby and Kids, along with women's ready-to-wear. Within home, results were strongest in the core and seasonal, including back-to-school.
Other category highlights this quarter included toys, part of our Kids' focus in hardlines, which saw more than a 12% increase in comp sales. This growth helped offset comp declines in electronics, which is a primary beneficiary of the second quarter promotions last year, and we're also seeing soft sales in tablets. Outside our stores, our focus on Style is evident as more than 80% of our second quarter digital channel sales growth was driven by home and apparel. In home, where digital penetration is much higher than average, digital channel growth half of our total comp this quarter. Looking ahead, we'll continue to work to advance the key strategic priorities we laid out last fall. First in our list is to become a leader in digital. This is critically important because of guest research shows that digital relevance drives traffic and engagement across all selling channels.
While we are pleased with the industry-leading growth we've seen so far this year, we have much more work to do, and a key asset we'll deploy is our stores. We're already shipping digital orders from approximately 140 stores, and by the end of this year, we'll be shipping from more than 450 locations. Ship-from-store capability allows us to balance inventory across the network, leverage the capital and labor already in our stores and reach guests more quickly.
To highlight the benefits of improved shipping times this fall, we'll begin testing what we're calling available to promise, in which will offer the guest a specific delivery commitment, typically 2 or 3 business days if a guest orders on a specific date. We believe this capability will drive further increases in digital conversion rates, which are already improving rapidly as guests respond to a faster and firmer delivery commitments.
Second on the list of key priorities is working on category roles. Beyond our efforts to grow signature categories, we're also focused on testing and learning how we can reposition our food offering to better serve our guests. While this work won't be completed until next year, we are engaged in many small tests throughout the country to gain a deeper understanding of how guests will respond to potential changes in assortment and presentation.
Through guest research, we already know we need to be more clearly highlighting Wellness in our food offering through both assortment and the information we provide. We're also focused on ways to elevate our food presentation and experience to fit the way the guests live and shop. We know we have an opportunity to provide fresh, healthy options and more relevant and localized assortment as our guests responding to healthy choices we're offering today. Within food, our market share in Wellness is already double our food share overall, and this quarter, we continue to see double-digit sales growth in these important categories.
This clearly shows that our guests are already responding when we enhance our assortment of natural, organic and better-for-you items in our stores. As a result, in the third quarter, we'll continue to expand our Wellness assortment in food with new food items in our Made to Matter collection and nearly 50 new items across 6 categories in our Simply Balanced brand.
Our third priority is develop capabilities to offer more localized experiences across our stores and a more personalized digital experience for our guests. While this work is ongoing, we're already seeing encouraging signs of the early progress on both fronts.
To inform our localization efforts, we launched a small test in the Chicago market, where we're working with a set of stores to test changes to assortment, presentation and inventory commitments on certain items. In these stores, we're highlighting locally relevant items, updating category adjacencies and changing shelf spacings to reflect the demographics around these individual stores. While this test is still early, we're encouraged with the guest response so far. Specifically, comp performance in this group of test stores has been 1 to 2 points higher than the rest of the Chicago market and a set of control stores. Items featured in the test are present in 5% to 10% of the guest baskets in these stores, and we have seen a meaningful improvement in our guest survey scores for variety of products in these stores.
Given these strong financial results, we are working to quickly build our capabilities and create an operating model that allow us to scale our efforts across a broader set of stores and demographic clusters.
As part of our personalization efforts, last year, we've replaced a third-party recommendation engine with internally developed product, which incorporates both in store and online guest history. In 2015, we've expanded the use of this engine across our mobile offerings, e-mail, subscriptions and Cartwheel. This new engine is driving a meaningful increase in conversion compared with the results on the prior third-party product, generating incremental sales of $50 million to $100 million so far this year. We've rolled out personalization recommendations to Cartwheel only a few weeks ago, but early data indicates that change is driving more than a 10% increase in a number of offers downloaded per user, a critical measure of engagement with this end.
Our fourth priority is to test and rollout new, more flexible formats to urban markets where populations are increasing, guest affinity for Target is high and our store penetration is low. This quarter, we were very excited to open a new CityTarget store in Boston, literally next door to Fenway Park, and we're pleased with the look and feel of the store and the positive response we've seen from our neighbors. We began working to develop the store a decade ago, well before we had smaller formats. And for this project, we're able to open a full-size store in a dense urban area. However, this opening begs the question of the criteria we're using that makes store CityTarget, a TargetExpress or simply, Target. As a result, we announced last month that going forward, we will no longer used a CityTarget or TargetExpress names on any of these new stores.
This announcement doesn't reflect the change in our desire to open stores in urban areas. It simply reflects our goal to become flexible in how we fit into every community with an ability to open up a variety stores, different sizes and layouts, offer locally relevant assortment and provide guests with easy access to items from our entire digital assortment through in-store pickup.
Our fifth and final priority is to advance our growth initiatives by changing the way we work and becoming a more effective and agile organization. This week, we announced several changes to our team, including John's promotion to the newly created Chief Operating Officer role and the hiring of Kathy Smith as our new Chief Financial Officer. 
I am very excited about these changes and confident that John and Kathy will play a critical role in Target's long-term success. In the past year, I have developed a deeper appreciation of John's knowledge and insights, and I believe he is the right person to improve our operations. Retail is changing more rapidly today than any time in my career, and we need to ensure that core operations keep pace with the new ways that we're serving the guests. 
Over time, Target has developed an incredibly complex supply chain, built to serve an outdated linear model, in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers to stores. To serve guests today, we're becoming much more flexible in the way we fulfill demand for products and services, and this is stretching our supply chain well beyond its core capabilities. And frankly, as a result, some retail fundamentals have started to suffer. Specifically, in stocks in our stores have been unacceptable so far this year, and our guests deserve better.
In this new role, I have asked John to focus first and foremost on improving the capabilities of our supply chain, working across organizational boundaries to understand and address root causes that are hampering day-to-day execution.
Beyond these immediate needs, I've asked John to continually assess and evolve our capabilities to ensure our operations keep up with our strategy in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.
As we plan to move John into this critical Chief Operating Officer role, it was really important to me that we hire a Chief Financial Officer who is a proven leader, someone capable of upholding Target's strong track record of disciplined financial management. So I'm very excited that we've convinced Kathy Smith to join our leadership team. She served as CFO at other large organizations, including Walmart, where Kathy and I were colleagues. I had the utmost confidence in Kathy as a strong financial and business leader. She'll be an outstanding addition to our leadership team, and John and I look forward to supporting her transition into this role.
1 year ago, I was only a week into my new position when I spoke on this earnings call. As I look back in the last year, I am very pleased with our progress and confident we're focused on the right strategic priorities because our guests are responding. As we plan for this year, we face the daunting challenge of sustaining traffic and sales without repeating last year's promotional intensity.
So far this year, traffic and sales are increasing, digital growth is far ahead of the industry, and signature categories are leading the way yet we will not slow down. We'll continue to invest in newness, innovation and presentation while we focus on maintaining a strong execution. We're seeing encouraging results in back-to-school and Back-to-College, and we'll work hard to maintain that momentum for the rest of the season.
Also this quarter, we're excited about our new plaid program, including more than 50 items from our latest design partner, Adam Lippes. Beyond Adam's design, our plaid takeover will feature hundreds of other products across a broad set of categories. Beyond apparel, accessories, home, and pets, you'll find plaid soda bottles, shampoo, bandages, paper towels and more. We're pleased with the early guest reaction and the media buzz and looking forward to rolling out these items throughout the quarter. Target is also featured prominently in the September issue of Vogue, which includes a 1 -- a 21-page insert where we reimagined some of the most iconic covers by incorporating products we sell.
This insert will be digitally shoppable so our guests can go behind the scenes to buy what they see and access additional content. And while to become even important in the fourth quarter, we're already ramping up our support this -- around this year's hot license products for Kids, both young and old, for Minions to Marvel, Avengers to Peanuts and of course, Star Wars.
These licenses are prominent in our assortment of back-to-school backpacks, and this fall, we'll feature them on Halloween costumes, decor, apparel, toys and much more. 
Before I end my remarks, I want to pause and thank the Target team, including the colleagues I met on my recent trip to India, who are doing amazing work in sourcing and the technology to support our strategic priorities.
For our team members around the world, this has already been a very eventful year as we made the changes to our team and our structure to better support our guests. Throughout all these changes, the team has remained resilient and energetic with a passion to serve our guests that's contagious. Every day I step back and marvel at the amazing things this team can deliver, iconic marketing, amazing products at an incredible price, fast and easy digital experiences and of course, a unique store experience that brings our Expect More, Pay Less promise to life every day. None of these would be possible without our great team, and the outstanding results we've seen so far this year are a testament to their efforts.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy Smith. Kathy won't officially begin her role until September 1, but I'm pleased that she is here today to introduce herself and share a few thoughts on Target and her new role. Kathy?"

Like Brian, I have long admired Target as a retailer and an iconic brand and a great American company.
During my career, I've had the opportunity to view Target through the lens of a competitor and of course, a guest. And now I'm pretty excited and humbled to have the opportunity to join the team as we work to transform how we serve guests while preserving what consumers love about this brand. 
While I won't start working here until next month, I really enjoyed getting to know the leadership team, and I had the opportunity to meet many of the members of the finance team this week.
Target's success comes from many things. Beyond the iconic brand, the company has an impressive array of owned and exclusive brands. As a guest and someone who loves retail, I am constantly impressed by Target's ability to deliver new, trendy, high-quality items at amazingly low prices. And I just know there are incredible product design, develop and sourcing teams behind those items.
In addition, I appreciate that Target has just at 1,800 well-maintained, great-looking stores in convenient locations, delivering a great shopping experience, and near and dear to every CFO's heart, we have a healthy balance sheet, which, when combined with our strong cash flow generation, create ample capacity to fund robust investment in growth and the return of billions of dollars to shareholders annually through dividends and share repurchases. 
And lastly, Target is full of passionate team members who work tirelessly to serve our guests everyday and who are proud of their Target. Let me tell you a brief story. As I was exploring the possibility of joining this amazing company, I wanted to move beyond the familiar experience of shopping at my Target. So I dedicated a couple of weeks to visit more than 55 stores across 10 states, and I dragged my family along for most of the ride. I spoke to guests in every store I visited, and I can tell you that they are clearly demanding enthusiasts. They love Target, and they enjoy sharing their personal stories about why they choose chose to shop with us. 
Before I close, I want to say that I'm looking forward to reconnecting with those of you I know and getting to know those of you I don't. I branched in my first few months with the team immersing myself in the business to ensure I have a detailed understanding of where we've been, where we are today, and where we need to go in the future. With that foundation, I look forward to meeting you and hearing your perspective. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and beyond that. John?"
174438,306665329,860878,"Target Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2015",2015-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kathy, and hello, everyone. We are really pleased with our second quarter results as a virtually every line on the P&L came in at or better than our expectations. Compared with our guidance going into the quarter, overall comparable sales were in",1999,"Thanks, Kathy, and hello, everyone. We are really pleased with our second quarter results as a virtually every line on the P&L came in at or better than our expectations. Compared with our guidance going into the quarter, overall comparable sales were in line with expectations, but the mix of store sales was a bit stronger than expected. 
Second quarter gross margin performance also met our expectations, but SG&A expense performance was much better than planned, reflecting our continued efforts to control costs, along with the impact of a timing change in marketing expense.
As a result, our second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.22, $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. Second quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.21, $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS, as pretax restructuring costs and breach-related expenses were $0.01 each were partially offset by a $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters.
Second quarter GAAP EPS of $1.18 reflects a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.25 loss on Canadian operations last year. This year's Canada losses were consistent with our expectations as an increase in our pool for estimated probable losses, primarily guarantee of leases, was offset by an adjustment to the tax benefits from the company's investment loss in Canada. 
Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Within the quarter, comps were strongest in May and June. However, this year's monthly pattern was a mirror image of last year's second quarter when the comp growth was strongest in July, which featured the most intense promotions in the quarter. As a result, on a 2-year basis, monthly comp trend were very consistent throughout the quarter. 
Importantly, transactions were positive, both in stores and online throughout the quarter, driving 2/3 of our comparable sales growth. Digital channel sales increased 30% in the second quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the second quarter last year. 
As Brian mentioned, second quarter 2014 was intensely promotional, and those promotions were a key driver of digital channel sales last year. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on achieving our digital channel sales goals through a combination of both traffic growth and conversion improvement. 
REDcard penetration was 22.1% in the second quarter, about 130 basis points ahead of last year. Portfolio delinquency and write-off metrics are at historically low levels, and we continue to see an increase in payment rates. This means the size of the portfolio continues to slowly decline, but better-than-expected risk metrics are offsetting this impact. As a result, profit sharing income in the portfolio was up this quarter compared to last year. 
One other note. This week, we began accepting EMV or chip card transactions at all stores across the country. As a result, this quarter, we will initiate the process of replacing all of our REDcard products with a chip-and-pin cards, including our private label credit and debit products.
While sales were in line with expectations, our second quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.9% was much stronger than expected. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was half a point higher than a year ago, right on our guidance. 
Consistent with the first quarter, this year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we annualized last year's postbreach promotional activity, and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature categories. 
I mentioned this last quarter, but I want to emphasize that once again, it is really important that we've been able to grow our traffic and sales even as we cycle over very intense promotions last year. Beyond the benefit of growing sales, there is a compelling gross margin benefit from growing our signature categories 3x as fast as the company, which more than offset the pressure on our cost of goods for investments in quality, innovation and presentation.
On the SG&A expense line, we had a standout quarter with a rate improvement about 60 basis points compared with last year. This performance was driven by outstanding discipline across the enterprise, combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives. These benefits more than offset a 40 basis point headwind from incentive compensation, which was unusually low in the second quarter 2014 and the financial performance we were experiencing at that time. 
As I noted earlier, marketing expense timing was a meaningful benefit this quarter as last year's second quarter spending was unusually high to support our promotions. And this year, we've retimed some spending into the third quarter in support of our back-to-school licenses and Target's file.
This timing shift benefited our second quarter SG&A rate by about 30 basis points or about half our overall rate favorability, and we expect this shift will reverse in the third quarter.
Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our quarter-end inventory position, which was about 4% above last year. This reflects a meaningful improvement from the 9% year-over-year increase we reported at the end of the first quarter, driven by issues of the West Coast ports. While we made a lot of progress in the second quarter, the year-over-year increases has moderated even further so far in August as our quarter end inventories supported back-to-school sales that moved into early August as a result of retiming of some tax-free holidays. Bottom line, we feel very good about our overall inventory levels in relation to our sales plans. However, we have a big opportunity to improve in stock levels, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
One note. You'll see in the balance sheet that we have moved pharmacy inventory into the other current assets lines in all periods, reflecting their current status as held for sale pending the close of our transaction with CVS. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. Second quarter interest expense was $148 million, flat to second quarter 2014, excluding last year's $285 million charge for early debt retirement. We paid second quarter dividend of $331 million, up 22% from last year, and we invested another $675 million to retire shares. That adds up to a total of $1 billion returned to our shareholders this quarter, representing more than 130% of net income.
Looking ahead, with healthy business results and an ample cash position, we expect to have the capacity to continue to returning a meaningful amount of cash through both dividends and share repurchases within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
As anticipated, given our continued desire to repurchase shares, in the second quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.
As of quarter end, under this program, we have retired more than 65 million shares at an average price of just over $67 a share for a total investment of about $4.4 billion. With the expansion of the program, we expect to have sufficient repurchase authority well into next year, including any potential repurchase resulting from the proceeds of the CVS transaction.
Regarding that transaction, things are continuing as expected as we work with CVS and regulators to advance the process of getting approval for the sale. Given the uncertainty of potential timing for regulatory approval and the closing of the transaction, the guidance we provide today does not reflect any expected impacts of the transaction, which includes application of proceeds and removal of prescription sales, costs and assets from our financial statements.
As I described last quarter, this year, we began reporting return on invested capital from continuing operations or ROIC because we believe it is an important metric in assessing the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. And as we covered in the financial community in March, our goal is to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next 5 years.
Not surprisingly, given our strong operating results, we reported a meaningful improvement in trailing 12-month ROIC this quarter as we grew 2 full percentage points to 13.3% compared with 11.3% a year ago.
Now let's move to our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. In the third quarter, we are cycling over stronger sales results from last year, both in stores and digital channels, and we expect the consumer and competitive environment to remain choppy. As a result, we are planning for third quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, including expected digital channel sales growth of about 30%. We expect our third quarter gross margin rate to increase 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year, reflecting a continued mix from the signature categories sales and the benefit from cycling last year's promotional activity, partially offset by investments in quality and price on our owned and exclusive brand products.
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our third quarter rate will be about flat to last year as the benefit from cost control is expected to be offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the shift in marketing spend from Q2.
Combining our gross margin and expense rate reductions, we are looking for improvement in our third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year.
Third quarter interest expense is expected to be approximately flat to last year, and tax expense expect increased by about $60 million, reflecting improved profitability and nonrecurring favorable tax items in third quarter last year.
Altogether, these expectations would lead to third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.89 compared with $0.79 a year ago. Note that this includes the impact of the shift in marketing timing, which translates to a $0.05 per share headwind in the third quarter. 
As we look ahead to the full year, we are certainly pleased with our results so far, which have notably stronger than expected, and we've been pleased with comp performance so far this month, including back-to-school sales, which reflect retiming of some tax-free holidays into early August. 
At the same time, we remain mindful of the intensely competitive nature of our holiday season and have noted the inventory levels we're seeing at some competitors. Taking both of those factors into account, we are updating our guidance for the full year adjusted EPS to $4.60 to $4.75, a $0.10 increase compared with the prior range. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to pause and comment on my priorities as I entered the new role as Chief Operations officer next month. As Brian mentioned, the #1 priority for my new team is to improve the way our supply chain functions from end to end. Achieving this goal lead to many benefits, perhaps the most visible of which is an improvement in our in stocks. Given the breadth and complexity of our business, it will always be a challenge in stock in every item and every store and in every moment of everyday.
But our guest need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials and unfortunately, in the last couple of quarters, our in stocks have been deteriorating. This challenge is understandable because we have been asking our supply chain to move well beyond its original design to become more flexible in the way we serve our guests. However, while we understand the reasons, the simple fact is that our current performance is unacceptable. 
So beginning this quarter, my team will be looking for quick and more contents of solutions to make improvements in the supply chain, both this year and over time. And beyond this initial effort, we will work to ensure that our operations and strategy will move in lockstep, enabling us to serve our guest in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. I look forward to updating on our progress over the coming months and years. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks, and now Brian, Kathy, and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

And I think the combination of those 2 elements is critical to continuing to drive traffic, make sure we delight the guest, see an improvement in our Net Promoter Scores and make sure that both in store and online, we're continuing to see an acceleration in traffic and visits to our site. So I think we're making very good progress right now. I think that's showing up in the results we delivered this quarter, but we're not satisfied. And we know we've got more work to do to ensure that we do meet the needs of the guests every time they shop, and critically important in meeting those needs us to make sure that we provide a great in-store experience and dramatically improve our in-stock conditions, particularly around core essentials.

Related to the supply chain, there is -- the team has done a great job responding to the needs of the organization over time to develop more flexible ways to meet the needs of our guests and really fulfill on-demand shopping. I think we're just at the point now where we need to step back and build broader capabilities across the entire radio supply chain as we continue to expand the way we want to serve our guests. So there is not one particular area of the company or one particular part of the business that we're completely focus on. Absent that, I would tell you, as I said you heard from Brian, in stocks are a key priority, and then specifically, being sure day to day and every store we are in stock are on essential comp.

Let me start with localization, and as I said during the last couple of calls, this is still a very nascent effort for us. We're in one market, a handful of stores in Chicago. But we've really been focusing on a handful of areas where we recognize we need to change our assortment, change our presentation, be more relevant and really recognize the needs and the demographics of these local markets. So there's a handful of categories I might lift up. One, craft beer and really making sure that in a category like craft beer, we have locally relevant items, and we recognize that even in the markets like Chicago, those need to be tailored neighborhood by neighborhood. So we've looked at the specialty foods, we've looked at categories like craft beer. We've looked at categories like patio and grills and recognizing that in the suburbs of Chicago, we can offer and should have in store large patio sets, 5-burner grills, but for our stores located in more of the urban neighborhoods of Chicago, we need bistro tables, and we need 2-burner grills because those guests are living in condos and apartments, they've got small patios, and we need to make sure we tailor our assortment and our presentation to recognize their needs and to make sure we're more locally relevant. So we're certainly spending a lot looking at food, and as we think about the food reinvention, a lot of this is going to be driven by making sure we have locally relevant brands, though some hometown favorites and also in broader categories like patio and furniture, making sure that we are matching up our assortments in store with the needs of the local guests. So a lot of additional work for us to do. But we're really pleased with the progress, and I talked about 1- to 2-point lift versus the test and control stores, that is a very important measure for us to continue to evaluate and working with John and our merchant team, we'll be looking to rapidly grow out the learning from Chicago into other relevant markets. From a digital standpoint, David, obviously, we continue to see really positive responses to our efforts like Cartwheel. And Cartwheel has now been downloaded over 18 million times. And every time on in stores, I run into guests that have their smartphone in their hand, and they're looking for their offers from Cartwheel. But we also recognize that Target is a brand that's talked about in social media every day, thousands of times every day. So if you were to visit our headquarters here in Minneapolis, just down the hall from my office, we have what we call guest central. It's our guest command center, where we're monitoring what people are talking about, what they are blogging about, how Target's being referenced in the news, and we're making sure we're very engaged with those bloggers and making sure that we're in the discussion. So it's a very important part of how we think about the brand and making sure that we incorporate social into our overall brand development initiatives."

The fact that within Kids, toys growing this quarter at 12%, and while again still in the early stages, the reaction to some of the changes we're making in our food assortments, the reaction the guest is taking to Made to Matter or Wellness initiatives, gives me a tremendous amount of confidence that as we continue to bring great design, fashion, quality and excitement to our signature categories and combine that with the opportunity to reinvent food, to bring great assortment that meets the needs of our guests, that to me is the magic to unlock sustainable growth to Target and to make sure we're driving traffic to our stores, more visits to our site. And it gets back fundamentally, Scott, I believe we win and we'll continue to grow by combining a great store experience, the convenience of allowing our guests to order online and pick up in our stores whenever they want and also being able to ship directly to their homes and using our stores as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that response is a quick one. So I'm very optimistic about the future. I think you're starting to see that embedded in the results, and the results in signature categories is very encouraging for us.

We're going to make sure that we as our guest engages with us digitally, we make it really easy. We make it easy to find a product and easy checkout experience. We believe that available to promise, which we'll roll out this fall, will give our guest the confidence that they know where the product as and when it will arrive for them, either in a store for them to pick up or to being available directly to their home. So we're focused on making sure that we provide not only great in-store but a great digital experience, and we are going to make sure that we continue to make our site easy to work with and more and more that's the mobile interchange we're going to make sure is easy for our guests to find product and checkout. We want to give them confidence when they order, they know it's available to promise, and we're going to have it there for them when they need it. And to the point John made, we don't need to be building upstream DCs. We're going to continue to convert more of our stores as we go into the fourth quarter close to 450 that will act as possible fulfillment centers to make sure that we can quickly and efficiently get productivity guests. So those fundamentalists are critically important as we think about driving industry-leading growth."

And if we're going to take hours out of the store will be because we limited work or to this point Brian made earlier, move upstream into the distribution centers. And so we're not focused on taking hours out of the store. We are focused on taking workout, and we have -- we're in the process of working through that. That's a little bit longer lead process than the some of the other things we have done. But we are very focused on essentially freeing up those hours of the store, and then we'll decide do we need them for improved guest service or how utilize that. But in fact, there's a couple of areas where we have invested hours back into the start as we put in the merchandising sets and as we put in mannequins, we've realized the need for dedicated store team members who can merchandise those have displays and make them look great all the time so that's the area where we have invested back into the store."

We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of t",2460,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. 
We are also pleased that once again this quarter, we were able to grow traffic and sales, both in stores and in digital channels, even as we were cycling over a very promotional second quarter from last year. 
Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our expectations. Notably, about 2/3 of this comp increase was driven by growth in traffic combined with a smaller increase in average ticket. Second quarter digital sales grew 30% from a year ago, slightly below our expectations as we compared against very intense digital channel promotions last year. 
Digital growth contributed about 60 basis points to our comp sales growth this quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 0.5% higher than last year as we continue to benefit from favorable merchandise mix and the comparison over last year's promotional markdowns. 
On the SG&A expense line, we had an unexpectedly strong quarter as we benefited from discipline throughout the organization, along with the impact of expense timing, as John will cover in a few minutes. 
With these results, we continue to benefit from very strong cash generation by our core business, which enabled us to return a combined $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchase. 
As we've outlined in the last several quarters, we're working to define clear roles for each of our merchandise categories and devoting resources to growing what we call our signature categories: Style, which includes the majority of Apparel; Home and Beauty categories; along with Baby; Kids; and Wellness. While we're still in the early days of this work, we're already seeing a compelling benefit from our efforts. Specifically, comp sales in signature categories grew more than 7% in the second quarter, 3x our overall comp growth.
This performance represents an acceleration from the first quarter when comp growth in signature categories was about double Target's overall comp growth. With strong signature category performance, comps in both Home and Apparel were in the 4% to 5% range this quarter. In Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids, along with women's ready-to-wear. Within Home, results were strongest in the core and Seasonal, including Back-to-School.
Other category highlights this quarter included Toys, part of our Kids focus in Hardlines, which saw more than a 12% increase in comp sales. This growth helped to offset comp declines in Electronics, which is a primary beneficiary of the second quarter promotions last year, and where we're also seeing soft sales in tablets. Outside our stores, our focus on Style was evident as more than 80% of our second quarter digital channel sales growth was driven by Home and Apparel. In Home, where digital penetration is much higher than average, digital channel growth drove half of our total comp this quarter. 
Looking ahead, we'll continue to work to advance the key strategic priorities we laid out last fall. First on our list is to become a leader in digital. This is critically important because guest research shows that digital relevance drives traffic and engagement across all selling channels.
While we are pleased with the industry-leading growth we've seen so far this year, we have much more work to do, and a key asset we'll deploy is our stores. We're already shipping digital orders from approximately 140 stores, and by the end of this year, we'll be shipping from more than 450 locations. Ship-from-store capabilities allows us to balance inventory across the network, leverage the capital and labor already in our stores and reach guests more quickly.
To highlight the benefits in improved shipping times this fall, we'll begin testing what we're calling ""available to promise,"" in which we'll offer the guest a specific delivery commitment, typically 2 or 3 business days if a guest orders on a specific date. We believe this capability will drive further increases in digital conversion rates, which are already improving rapidly as guests respond to a faster and firmer delivery commitment.
Second on the list of key priorities is working on category roles. Beyond our efforts to grow signature categories, we're also focused on testing and learning how we can reposition our food offering to better serve our guests. While this work won't be complete until next year, we are engaged in many small tests throughout the country to gain a deeper understanding of how guests will respond to potential changes in assortment and presentation.
Through guest research, we already know we need to be more clearly highlighting Wellness in our food offering through both assortment and the information we provide. We're also focused on ways to elevate our food presentation and experience to fit the way the guests live and shop. We know we have an opportunity to provide fresh, healthy options and more relevant and localized assortment as our guests are responding to the healthy choices we're offering today. Within Food, our market share in Wellness is already double our food share overall, and this quarter, we continue to see double-digit sales growth in these important categories.
This clearly shows that our guests are already responding when we enhance our assortment of natural, organic and better-for-you items in our stores. As a result, in the third quarter, we'll continue to expand our Wellness assortment in Food with new food items in our Made to Matter collection and nearly 50 new items across 6 categories in our Simply Balanced brand.
Our third priority is to develop capabilities to offer more localized experiences across our stores and a more personalized digital experience for our guests. While this work is ongoing, we're already seeing encouraging signs of the early progress on both fronts.
To inform our localization efforts, we launched a small test in the Chicago market, where we're working with a set of stores to test changes to assortment, presentation and inventory commitments on certain items. In these stores, we're highlighting locally relevant items, updating category adjacencies and changing shelf facings to reflect the demographics around these individual stores. While this test is still early, we're encouraged with the guest response so far. Specifically, comp performance in this group of test stores has been 1 to 2 points higher than the rest of the Chicago market and a set of control stores. Items featured in the test are present in 5% to 10% of the guest baskets in these stores, and we have seen a meaningful improvement in our guest survey scores for a variety of products in these stores.
Given these strong initial results, we're working to quickly build our capabilities and create an operating model that allow us to scale our efforts across a broader set of stores and demographic clusters.
As part of our personalization efforts, last year, we replaced a third-party recommendation engine with an internally developed product which incorporates both in-store and online guest history. In 2015, we've expanded the use of this engine across our mobile offerings, e-mail, subscriptions and Cartwheel. This new engine is driving a meaningful increase in conversion compared with the results on the prior third-party product, generating incremental sales of $50 million to $100 million so far this year. We've rolled out personalization recommendations to Cartwheel only a few weeks ago, but early data indicates the change is driving more than a 10% increase in the number of offers downloaded per user, a critical measure of engagement with this app.
Our fourth priority is to test and roll out new, more flexible formats to urban markets, where populations are increasing, guest affinity for Target is high and our store penetration is low. This quarter, we were very excited to open a new CityTarget store in Boston, literally next door to Fenway Park, and we're pleased with the look and feel of the store and the positive response we've seen from our neighbors. We began working to develop the store a decade ago, well before we had smaller formats, and for this project, we were able to open a full-size store in a dense urban area. However, this opening begs the question of the criteria we're using, ""Is it better to make stores a CityTarget, a TargetExpress or simply, Target?"" As a result, we announced last month that going forward, we will no longer use a CityTarget or TargetExpress names on any of these new stores.
This announcement doesn't reflect the change in our desire to open stores in urban areas. It simply reflects our goal to become flexible in how we fit into every community, with an ability to open up a variety of stores, different sizes and layouts, offer a locally relevant assortment and provide guests with easy access to items from our entire digital assortment through in-store pickup.
Our fifth and final priority is to advance our growth initiatives by changing the way we work and becoming a more effective and agile organization. This week, we announced several changes to our team, including John's promotion to the newly created Chief Operating Officer role and the hiring of Cathy Smith as our new Chief Financial Officer. 
I am very excited about these changes and confident that John and Cathy will play a critical role in Target's long-term success. In the past year, I have developed a deep appreciation of John's knowledge and insight, and I believe he is the right person to improve our operations. Retail is changing more rapidly today than any time in my career, and we need to ensure that core operations keep pace with the new ways we're serving the guest. 
Over time, Target has developed an incredibly complex supply chain, built to serve an outdated linear model, in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers, to stores. To serve guests today, we're becoming much more flexible in the way we fulfill demand for products and services, and this is stretching our supply chain well beyond its core capabilities. And frankly, as a result, some retail fundamentals have started to suffer. Specifically, in-stocks in our stores have been unacceptable so far this year, and our guests deserve better.
In this new role, I have asked John to focus, first and foremost, on improving the capabilities of our supply chain, working across organizational boundaries to understand and address root causes that are hampering day-to-day execution.
Beyond these immediate needs, I've asked John to continually assess and evolve our capabilities to ensure our operations keep up with our strategy in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.
As we plan to move John into this critical Chief Operating Officer role, it was really important to me that we hire a Chief Financial Officer who is a proven leader, someone capable of upholding Target's strong track record of disciplined financial management. So I'm very excited that we've convinced Cathy Smith to join our leadership team. She served as a CFO at other large organizations, including Walmart, where Cathy and I were colleagues. I have the utmost confidence in Cathy as a strong financial and business leader. She'll be an outstanding addition to our leadership team, and John and I look forward to supporting her transition into this role.
1 year ago, I was only a week into my new position when I spoke on this earnings call. As I look back in the last year, I am very pleased with our progress and confident we're focused on the right strategic priorities because our guests are responding. As we plan for this year, we face the daunting challenge of sustaining traffic and sales without repeating last year's promotional intensity.
So far this year, traffic and sales are increasing, digital growth is far ahead of the industry and signature categories are leading the way. Yet, we will not slow down. We'll continue to invest in newness, innovation and presentation while we focus on maintaining strong execution. We're seeing encouraging results in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, and we'll work hard to maintain that momentum for the rest of the season.
Also, this quarter, we're excited about our new plaid program, including more than 50 items from our latest design partner, Adam Lippes. Beyond Adam's design, our plaid takeover will feature hundreds of other products across a broad set of categories. Beyond Apparel, Accessories, Home and pets, you'll find plaid soda bottles, shampoo, bandages, paper towels and more. We're pleased with the early guest reaction and the media buzz and looking forward to rolling out these items throughout the quarter. 
Target is also featured prominently in the September issue of Vogue, which includes a 1 -- a 21-page insert where we've reimagined some of the most iconic covers by incorporating products we sell. This insert will be digitally shoppable so our guests can go behind the scenes to buy what they see and access additional content. And while they will become even important in the fourth quarter, we're already ramping up our support this -- around this year's hot license products for Kids, both young and old, from Minions to Marvel, Avengers to Peanuts and of course, Star Wars.
These licenses are prominent in our assortment of Back-to-School backpacks, and this fall, we'll feature them on Halloween costumes, decor, apparel, toys and much more. 
Before I end my remarks, I want to pause and thank the Target team, including the colleagues I met on my recent trip to India, who are doing amazing work in sourcing and technology to support our strategic growth priorities.
For our team members around the world, this has already been a very eventful year as we made changes to our team and our structure to better support our guests. Throughout all these changes, the team has remained resilient and energetic, with a passion to serve our guests that's contagious. Every day I step back and marvel at the amazing things this team can deliver, iconic marketing, amazing products at an incredible price, fast and easy digital experiences and of course, a unique store experience that brings our Expect More. Pay Less. promise to life every day. None of these would be possible without our great team, and the outstanding results we've seen so far this year are a testament to their efforts.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Cathy Smith. Cathy won't officially begin her role until September 1, but I'm pleased that she is here today to introduce herself and share a few thoughts about Target and her new role. Cathy?"

Like Brian, I have long admired Target as a retailer and an iconic brand and a great American company.
During my career, I've had the opportunity to view Target through the lens of a competitor and of course, a guest. And now I'm really excited and humbled to have the opportunity to join the team as we work to transform how we serve guests while preserving what consumers love about this brand. 
While I won't start working here until next month, I've really enjoyed getting to know the leadership team, and I've had the opportunity to meet with many of the members of the finance team this week.
Target's success comes from many things. Beyond the iconic brand, the company has an impressive array of owned and exclusive brands. As a guest and someone who loves retail, I am constantly impressed by Target's ability to deliver new, trendy, high-quality items at amazingly low prices. And I just know there are incredible product design, develop and sourcing teams behind those items.
In addition, I appreciate that Target has just at 1,800 well-maintained, great-looking stores in convenient locations, delivering a great shopping experience, and near and dear to every CFO's heart, we have a healthy balance sheet, which, when combined with our strong cash flow generation, creates ample capacity to fund robust investment in growth and the return of billions of dollars to shareholders annually through dividends and share repurchases. 
And lastly, Target is full of passionate team members who work tirelessly to serve our guests everyday and who are proud of their Target. 
Let me tell you a brief story. As I was exploring the possibility of joining this amazing company, I wanted to move beyond the familiar experience of shopping at my Target. So I dedicated a couple of weeks to visit more than 55 stores across 10 states, and I dragged my family along for most of the ride. I spoke to guests in every store I visited, and I can tell you that they are clearly demanding enthusiasts. They love Target, and they enjoy sharing their personal stories about why they choose to shop with us. 
Before I close, I want to say that I'm looking forward to reconnecting with those of you I know and getting to know those of you I don't. I plan to spend my first few months with the team immersing myself in the business to ensure I have a detailed understanding of where we've been, where we are today and where we need to go in the future. With that foundation, I look forward to meeting you and hearing your perspective. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. John?"
174438,306665329,860948,"Target Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2015",2015-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Cathy, and hello, everyone. We are really pleased with our second quarter results as virtually every line on the P&L came in at/or better than our expectations.

We are really pleased with our second quarter results as virtually every line on the P&L came in at/or better than our expectations. Compared with our guidance going into the quarter, overall comparable sales were in line with expectations, but the mix of store sales was a bit stronger than expected. 
Second quarter gross margin performance also met our expectations, but SG&A expense performance was much better than planned, reflecting our continued efforts to control costs, along with the impact of a timing change in marketing expense.
As a result, our second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.22, $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. Second quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.21, $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS as pretax restructuring costs and breach-related expenses, worth $0.01 each, were partially offset by a $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters.
Second quarter GAAP EPS of $1.18 reflects a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.25 loss on Canadian operations last year. This year's Canada losses were consistent with our expectations as an increase in our pool for estimated probable losses, primarily guarantee of leases, was offset by an adjustment to the tax benefit from the company's investment loss in Canada. 
Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Within the quarter, comps were strongest in May and June. However, this year's monthly pattern was the mirror image of last year's second quarter when the comp growth was strongest in July, which featured the most intense promotions in the quarter. As a result, on a 2-year basis, monthly comp trends were very consistent throughout the quarter. 
Importantly, transactions were positive both in stores and online throughout the quarter, driving 2/3 of our comparable sales growth. Digital channel sales increased 30% in the second quarter, on top of more than 30% growth in the second quarter last year. 
As Brian mentioned, second quarter 2014 was intensely promotional, and those promotions were a key driver of digital channel sales last year. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on achieving our digital channel sales goals through a combination of both traffic growth and conversion improvement. 
REDcard penetration was 22.1% in the second quarter, about 130 basis points ahead of last year. Portfolio delinquency and write-off metrics are at historically low levels, and we continue to see an increase in payment rates. This means the size of the portfolio continues to slowly decline, but better-than-expected risk metrics are offsetting this impact. As a result, profit sharing income on the portfolio was up this quarter compared to last year. 
One other note. This week, we began accepting EMV or chip-card transactions at all stores across the country. As a result, this quarter, we will initiate the process of replacing all of our REDcard products with chip-and-PIN cards, including our private label credit and debit products.
While sales were in line with expectations, our second quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.9% was much stronger than expected. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was half a point higher than a year ago, right on our guidance. 
Consistent with the first quarter, this year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we annualized last year's post-breach promotional activity, and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature categories. 
I mentioned this last quarter, but I want to emphasize it once again. It is really important that we've been able to grow our traffic and sales even as we cycle over very intense promotions last year. Beyond the benefit of growing sales, there is a compelling gross margin benefit from growing our signature categories 3x as fast as the company, which more than offsets the pressure on our cost of goods for investments in quality, innovation and presentation.
On the SG&A expense line, we had a standout quarter, with rate improvement of about 60 basis points compared with last year. This performance was driven by outstanding discipline across the enterprise, combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives. These benefits more than offset a 40 basis point headwind from incentive compensation, which was unusually low in the second quarter 2014 in light of the financial performance we were experiencing at the time. 
As I noted earlier, marketing expense timing was a meaningful benefit this quarter as last year's second quarter spending was unusually high to support our promotions. And this year, we've retimed some spending into the third quarter in support of our Back-to-School licenses in Target Style.
This timing shift benefited our second quarter SG&A rate by about 30 basis points or about half our overall rate favorability, and we expect this shift will reverse in the third quarter.
Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our quarter-end inventory position, which was about 4% above last year. This reflects a meaningful improvement from the 9% year-over-year increase we reported at the end of the first quarter, driven by issues at the West Coast ports. While we made a lot of progress in the second quarter, the year-over-year increases moderated even further so far in August as our quarter-end inventory supported Back-to-School sales that moved into early August as a result of retiming of some tax-free holidays. Bottom line, we feel very good about our overall inventory levels in relation to our sales plans. However, we have a big opportunity to improve in-stock levels, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
One note. You'll see on the balance sheet that we have moved pharmacy inventory into the other current assets line in all periods, reflecting their current status as held-for-sale pending the close of our transaction with CVS. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. Second quarter interest expense was $148 million, flat to second quarter 2014, excluding last year's $285 million charge for early debt retirement. We paid second quarter dividends of $331 million, up 22% from last year, and we invested another $675 million to retire shares. That adds up to a total of $1 billion returned to our shareholders this quarter, representing more than 130% of net income.
Looking ahead, with healthy business results and an ample cash position, we expect to have the capacity to continue to returning a meaningful amount of cash through both dividends and share repurchases within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
As anticipated, given our continued desire to repurchase shares, in the second quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.
As of quarter end, under this program, we have retired more than 65 million shares at an average price of just over $67 a share for a total investment of about $4.4 billion. With the expansion of the program, we expect to have sufficient repurchase authority well into next year, including any potential repurchase resulting from the proceeds of the CVS transaction.
Regarding that transaction, things are continuing as expected as we work with CVS and regulators to advance the process of getting approval for the sale. Given the uncertainty of potential timing for regulatory approval and the closing of the transaction, the guidance we provide today does not reflect any expected impacts of the transaction, which includes application of proceeds and removal of prescription sales, costs and assets from our financial statements.
As I described last quarter, this year, we began reporting return on invested capital from continuing operations, or ROIC, because we believe it is an important metric in assessing the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. And as we covered in the financial community meeting in March, our goal is to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next 5 years.
Not surprisingly, given our strong operating results, we reported a meaningful improvement in trailing 12-month ROIC this quarter as we grew 2 full percentage points to 13.3% compared with 11.3% a year ago.
Now let's move to our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. In the third quarter, we are cycling over stronger sales results from last year, both in stores and digital channels, and we expect the consumer and competitive environment to remain choppy. As a result, we are planning for a third quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, including expected digital channel sales growth of about 30%. We expect our third quarter gross margin rate to increase 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year, reflecting a continued mix from the signature category sales and the benefit from cycling last year's promotional activity, partially offset by investments in quality and price on our owned and exclusive brand products.
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our third quarter rate will be about flat to last year as the benefit from cost control is expected to be offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the shift in marketing spend from Q2.
Combining our gross margin and expense rate reductions, we're looking for improvement in our third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year.
Third quarter interest expense is expected to be approximately flat to last year, and tax expenses expect to increase by about $60 million, reflecting improved profitability and nonrecurring favorable tax items in third quarter last year.
Altogether, these expectations would lead to third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.89 compared with $0.79 a year ago. Note that this includes the impact of the shift in marketing timing, which translates to a $0.05 per share headwind in the third quarter. 
As we look ahead to the full year, we are certainly pleased with our results so far, which have been notably stronger than expected, and we've been pleased with comp performance so far this month, including Back-to-School sales which reflected retiming of some tax-free holidays into early August. 
At the same time, we remain mindful of the intensely competitive nature of our holiday season and have noted the inventory levels we're seeing at some competitors. Taking both of those factors into account, we are updating our guidance for the full year adjusted EPS to $4.60 to $4.75, a $0.10 increase compared with the prior range. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to pause and comment on my priorities as I enter the new role as Chief Operations Officer next month. As Brian mentioned, the #1 priority for my new team is to improve the way our supply chain functions from end to end. Achieving this goal will lead to many benefits, perhaps the most visible of which is an improvement in our in-stocks. Given the breadth and complexity of our business, it will always be a challenge to be in stock on every item in every store, in every moment of every day.
But our guest need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials and unfortunately, in the last couple of quarters, our in-stocks have been deteriorating. This challenge is understandable because we have been asking our supply chain to move well beyond its original design and become more flexible in the way we serve our guests. However, while we understand the reasons, the simple fact is that our current performance is unacceptable. 
So beginning this quarter, my team will be looking for both quick and more comprehensive solutions to make improvements in the supply chain, both this year and over time. And beyond this initial effort, we will work to ensure that our operations and strategy will move in lockstep, enabling us to serve our guests in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. I look forward to updating on our progress over the coming months and years. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. And now Brian, Cathy, and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

But we've really been focusing on a handful of areas where we recognize we need to change our assortment, change our presentation, be more relevant and really recognize the needs and the demographics of these local markets. So there's a handful of categories I might lift up. One, craft beer, and really making sure that in a category like craft beer, we have locally relevant items and we recognize that even in a market like Chicago, those need to be tailored neighborhood-by-neighborhood. So we've looked at specialty foods, we've looked at categories like craft beer. We've looked at categories like patio and grills and recognizing that in the suburbs of Chicago, we can offer and should have in store large patio sets, 5-burner grills. But for our stores located in more of the urban neighborhoods of Chicago, we need bistro tables and we need 2-burner grills because those guests are living in condos and apartments, they've got small patios, and we need to make sure we tailor our assortment and our presentation to recognize their needs and to make sure we're more locally relevant. So we're certainly spending a lot of time looking at food, and as we think about the food reinvention, a lot of this is going to be driven by making sure we have locally relevant brands, those hometown favorites, and also in broader categories like patio and furniture, making sure that we're matching up our assortment in store with the needs of that local guest. So a lot of additional work for us to do, but we're really pleased with the progress. And I talked about a 1- to 2-point lift versus the test and control stores, that is a very important measure for us to continue to evaluate. And working with John and our merch team, we'll be looking to rapidly roll out the learning from Chicago into other relevant markets. From a digital standpoint, David, obviously, we continue to see really positive responses to some of our efforts like Cartwheel. And Cartwheel has now been downloaded over 18 million times. And every time I'm in stores, I run into guests that have their smartphone in their hand and they're looking for their offers from Cartwheel. But we also recognize that Target is a brand that's talked about in social media every day, thousands of times every day. So if you were to visit our headquarters here in Minneapolis, just down the hall from my office, we have what we call ""guest central."" It's our guest command center, where we're monitoring what people are talking about, what they are blogging about, how Target's being referenced in the news, and we're making sure we're very engaged with those bloggers and making sure that we're in the discussion. So it's a very important part of how we think about the brand and making sure that we incorporate social into our overall brand development initiatives."

And so we're not focused on taking hours out of the store. We are focused on taking workout and we haven't -- we're in the process of working through that. That's a little bit longer lead process than some of the other things we have done. But we're very focused on essentially freeing up those hours in the store and then we'll decide do we need them for improved guest service or how we'll utilize them. But in fact, we've -- there's a couple of areas where we have invested hours back into the store as we put in the whole merchandising sets. And as we put in mannequins, we've realized the need for dedicated store team members who can merchandise those displays and make them look great all the time.

We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of t",2453,"Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. 
We are also pleased that once again this quarter, we were able to grow traffic and sales, both in stores and in digital channels, even as we were cycling over a very promotional second quarter from last year. 
Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our expectations. Notably, about 2/3 of this comp increase was driven by growth in traffic combined with a smaller increase in average ticket. Second quarter digital sales grew 30% from a year ago, slightly below our expectations as we compared against very intense digital channel promotions last year. 
Digital growth contributed about 60 basis points to our comp sales growth this quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 0.5% higher than last year as we continue to benefit from favorable merchandise mix and the comparison over last year's promotional markdowns. 
On the SG&A expense line, we had an unexpectedly strong quarter as we benefited from discipline throughout the organization, along with the impact of expense timing, as John will cover in a few minutes. 
With these results, we continue to benefit from very strong cash generation by our core business, which enabled us to return a combined $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchase. 
As we've outlined in the last several quarters, we're working to define clear roles for each of our merchandise categories and devoting resources to growing what we call our signature categories: Style, which includes the majority of Apparel; Home and Beauty categories; along with Baby; Kids; and Wellness. While we're still in the early days of this work, we're already seeing a compelling benefit from our efforts. Specifically, comp sales in signature categories grew more than 7% in the second quarter, 3x our overall comp growth.
This performance represents an acceleration from the first quarter when comp growth in signature categories was about double Target's overall comp growth. With strong signature category performance, comps in both Home and Apparel were in the 4% to 5% range this quarter. In Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids, along with Women's ready-to-wear. Within Home, results were strongest in the core and Seasonal, including Back-to-School.
Other category highlights this quarter included Toys, part of our Kids focus in Hardlines, which saw more than a 12% increase in comp sales. This growth helped to offset comp declines in Electronics, which is a primary beneficiary of the second quarter promotions last year, and where we're also seeing soft sales in tablets. Outside our stores, our focus on Style was evident as more than 80% of our second quarter digital channel sales growth was driven by Home and Apparel. In Home, where digital penetration is much higher than average, digital channel growth drove half of our total comp this quarter. 
Looking ahead, we'll continue to work to advance the key strategic priorities we laid out last fall. First on our list is to become a leader in digital. This is critically important because guest research shows that digital relevance drives traffic and engagement across all selling channels.
While we are pleased with the industry-leading growth we've seen so far this year, we have much more work to do, and a key asset we'll deploy is our stores. We're already shipping digital orders from approximately 140 stores, and by the end of this year, we'll be shipping from more than 450 locations. Ship-from-store capabilities allows us to balance inventory across the network, leverage the capital and labor already in our stores and reach guests more quickly.
To highlight the benefits in improved shipping times this fall, we'll begin testing what we're calling ""available to promise,"" in which we'll offer the guest a specific delivery commitment, typically 2 or 3 business days if the guest orders on a specific date. We believe this capability will drive further increases in digital conversion rates, which are already improving rapidly as guests respond to a faster and firmer delivery commitment.
Second on the list of key priorities is working on category roles. Beyond our efforts to grow signature categories, we're also focused on testing and learning how we can reposition our food offering to better serve our guests. While this work won't be complete until next year, we are engaged in many small tests throughout the country to gain a deeper understanding of how guests will respond to potential changes in assortment and presentation.
Through guest research, we already know we need to be more clearly highlighting Wellness in our food offering through both assortment and the information we provide. We're also focused on ways to elevate our food presentation and experience to fit the way the guests live and shop. We know we have an opportunity to provide fresh, healthy options and more relevant and localized assortment as our guests are responding to healthy choices we're offering today. Within Food, our market share in Wellness is already double our food share overall, and this quarter, we continue to see double-digit sales growth in these important categories.
This clearly shows that our guests are already responding when we enhance our assortment of natural, organic and better-for-you items in our stores. As a result, in the third quarter, we'll continue to expand our Wellness assortment in Food with new food items in our Made to Matter collection and nearly 50 new items across 6 categories in our Simply Balanced brand.
Our third priority is to develop capabilities to offer more localized experiences across our stores and a more personalized digital experience for our guests. While this work is ongoing, we're already seeing encouraging signs of the early progress on both fronts.
To inform our localization efforts, we launched a small test in the Chicago market, where we're working with a set of stores to test changes to assortment, presentation and inventory commitments on certain items. In these stores, we're highlighting locally relevant items, updating category adjacencies and changing shelf facings to reflect the demographics around these individual stores. While this test is still early, we're encouraged with the guest response so far. Specifically, comp performance in this group of test stores has been 1 to 2 points higher than the rest of the Chicago market and a set of control stores. Items featured in the test are present in 5% to 10% of the guest baskets in these stores, and we have seen a meaningful improvement in our guest survey scores for a variety of products in these stores.
Given these strong initial results, we're working to quickly build our capabilities and create an operating model that allow us to scale our efforts across a broader set of stores and demographic clusters.
As part of our personalization efforts, last year, we replaced a third-party recommendation engine with an internally developed product which incorporates both in-store and online guest history. In 2015, we've expanded the use of this engine across our mobile offerings, e-mail, subscriptions and Cartwheel. This new engine is driving a meaningful increase in conversion compared with the results on the prior third-party product, generating incremental sales of $50 million to $100 million so far this year. We've rolled out personalization recommendations to Cartwheel only a few weeks ago, but early data indicates the change is driving more than a 10% increase in the number of offers downloaded per user, a critical measure of engagement with this app.
Our fourth priority is to test and roll out new, more flexible formats to urban markets, where populations are increasing, guest affinity for Target is high and our store penetration is low. This quarter, we were very excited to open a new CityTarget store in Boston, literally next door to Fenway Park, and we're pleased with the look and feel of the store and the positive response we've seen from our neighbors. We began working to develop the store a decade ago, well before we had smaller formats, and for this project, we were able to open a full-size store in a dense urban area. However, this opening begs the question of the criteria we're using to designate stores as CityTargets, a TargetExpress or simply, Target. As a result, we announced last month that going forward, we will no longer use a CityTarget or TargetExpress names on any of these new stores.
This announcement doesn't reflect the change in our desire to open stores in urban areas. It simply reflects our goal to become flexible in how we fit into every community, with an ability to open up a variety of stores, different sizes and layouts, offer a locally relevant assortment and provide guests with easy access to items from our entire digital assortment through in-store pickup.
Our fifth and final priority is to advance our growth initiatives by changing the way we work and becoming a more effective and agile organization. This week, we announced several changes to our team, including John's promotion to the newly created Chief Operating Officer role and the hiring of Cathy Smith as our new Chief Financial Officer. 
I am very excited about these changes and confident that John and Cathy will play a critical role in Target's long-term success. In the past year, I've developed a deep appreciation of John's knowledge and insight, and I believe he is the right person to improve our operations. Retail is changing more rapidly today than any time in my career, and we need to ensure that core operations keep pace with the new ways we're serving the guest. 
Over time, Target has developed an incredibly complex supply chain, built to serve an outdated linear model, in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers, to stores. To serve guests today, we're becoming much more flexible in the way we fulfill demand for products and services, and this is stretching our supply chain well beyond its core capabilities. And frankly, as a result, some retail fundamentals have started to suffer. Specifically, in-stocks in our stores have been unacceptable so far this year, and our guests deserve better.
In this new role, I have asked John to focus, first and foremost, on improving the capabilities of our supply chain, working across organizational boundaries to understand and address root causes that are hampering day-to-day execution.
Beyond these immediate needs, I've asked John to continually assess and evolve our capabilities to ensure our operations keep up with our strategy in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.
As we plan to move John into this critical Chief Operating Officer role, it was really important to me that we hired a Chief Financial Officer who is a proven leader, someone capable of upholding Target's strong track record of disciplined financial management. So I'm very excited that we've convinced Cathy Smith to join our leadership team. She served as a CFO at other large organizations, including Walmart, where Cathy and I were colleagues. I have the utmost confidence in Cathy as a strong financial and business leader. She'll be an outstanding addition to our leadership team, and John and I look forward to supporting her transition into this role.
One year ago, I was only a week into my new position when I spoke on this earnings call. As I look back in the last year, I am very pleased with our progress and confident we're focused on the right strategic priorities because our guests are responding. As we plan for this year, we face the daunting challenge of sustaining traffic and sales without repeating last year's promotional intensity.
So far this year, traffic and sales are increasing, digital growth is far ahead of the industry and signature categories are leading the way. Yet, we will not slow down. We'll continue to invest in newness, innovation and presentation while we focus on maintaining strong execution. We're seeing encouraging results in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, and we'll work hard to maintain that momentum for the rest of the season.
Also, this quarter, we're excited about our new plaid program, including more than 50 items from our latest design partner, Adam Lippes. Beyond Adam's design, our plaid takeover will feature hundreds of other products across a broad set of categories. Beyond Apparel, Accessories, Home and pets, you'll find plaid soda bottles, shampoo, bandages, paper towels and more. We're pleased with the early guest reaction and the media buzz and looking forward to rolling out these items throughout the quarter. 
Target is also featured prominently in the September issue of Vogue, which includes a 1 -- a 21-page insert where we've reimagined some of the most iconic covers by incorporating products we sell. This insert will be digitally shoppable so our guests can go behind the scenes to buy what they see and access additional content. And while they'll become even important in the fourth quarter, we're already ramping up our support this -- around this year's hot license products for Kids, both young and old, from Minions to Marvel, Avengers to Peanuts and of course, Star Wars.
These licenses are prominent in our assortment of Back-to-School backpacks, and this fall, we'll feature them on Halloween costumes, decor, apparel, toys and much more. 
Before I end my remarks, I want to pause and thank the Target team, including the colleagues I met on my recent trip to India, who are doing amazing work in sourcing and technology to support our strategic growth priorities.
For our team members around the world, this has already been a very eventful year as we made changes to our team and our structure to better support our guests. Throughout all these changes, the team has remained resilient and energetic, with a passion to serve our guests that's contagious. Every day I step back and marvel at the amazing things this team can deliver, iconic marketing, amazing products at an incredible price, fast and easy digital experiences and of course, a unique store experience that brings our Expect More. Pay Less promise to life every day. None of this would be possible without our great team, and the outstanding results we've seen so far this year are a testament to their efforts.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Cathy Smith. Cathy won't officially begin her role until September 1, but I'm pleased that she's here today to introduce herself and share a few thoughts about Target and her new role. Cathy?"

Like Brian, I have long admired Target as a retailer and an iconic brand and a great American company.
During my career, I've had the opportunity to view Target through the lens of a competitor and of course, a guest. And now I'm really excited and humbled to have the opportunity to join the team as we work to transform how we serve guests while preserving what consumers love about this brand. 
While I won't start working here until next month, I've really enjoyed getting to know the leadership team, and I've had the opportunity to meet with many of the members of the finance team this week.
Target's success comes from many things. Beyond the iconic brand, the company has an impressive array of owned and exclusive brands. As a guest and someone who loves retail, I am constantly impressed by Target's ability to deliver new, trendy, high-quality items at amazingly low prices. And I just know there are incredible product design, develop and sourcing teams behind those items.
In addition, I appreciate that Target has just at 1,800 well-maintained, great-looking stores in convenient locations, delivering a great shopping experience, and near and dear to every CFO's hearts, we have a healthy balance sheet, which, when combined with our strong cash flow generation, creates ample capacity to fund robust investment in growth and the return of billions of dollars to shareholders annually through dividends and share repurchases. 
And lastly, Target is full of passionate team members who work tirelessly to serve our guests every day and who are proud of their Target. 
Let me tell you a brief story. As I was exploring the possibility of joining this amazing company, I wanted to move beyond the familiar experience of shopping at my Target. So I dedicated a couple of weeks to visit more than 55 stores across 10 states, and I dragged my family along for most of the ride. I spoke to guests in every store I visited, and I can tell you that they are clearly demanding enthusiasts. They love Target, and they enjoyed sharing their personal stories about why they choose to shop with us. 
Before I close, I want to say that I'm looking forward to reconnecting with those of you I know and getting to know those of you I don't. I plan to spend my first few months with the team immersing myself in the business to ensure I have a detailed understanding of where we've been, where we are today and where we need to go in the future. With that foundation, I look forward to meeting you and hearing your perspective. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. John?"
174438,306665329,860986,"Target Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2015",2015-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Cathy, and hello, everyone.

We are really pleased with our second quarter results as virtually every line on the P&L came in at/or better than our expectations. Compared with our guidance going into the quarter, overall comparable sales were in line with expectations, but the mix of store sales was a bit stronger than expected. 
Second quarter gross margin performance also met our expectations, but SG&A expense performance was much better than planned, reflecting our continued efforts to control costs, along with the impact of a timing change in marketing expense.
As a result, our second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.22, $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. Second quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.21, $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS as pretax restructuring costs and breach-related expenses, worth $0.01 each, were partially offset by a $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters.
Second quarter GAAP EPS of $1.18 reflects a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.25 loss on Canadian operations last year. This year's Canada losses were consistent with our expectations as an increase in our pool for estimated probable losses, primarily guarantee of leases, was offset by an adjustment to the tax benefit from the company's investment loss in Canada. 
Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Within the quarter, comps were strongest in May and June. However, this year's monthly pattern was the mirror image of last year's second quarter when the comp growth was strongest in July, which featured the most intense promotions in the quarter. As a result, on a 2-year basis, monthly comp trends were very consistent throughout the quarter. 
Importantly, transactions were positive both in stores and online throughout the quarter, driving 2/3 of our comparable sales growth. Digital channel sales increased 30% in the second quarter, on top of more than 30% growth in the second quarter last year. 
As Brian mentioned, second quarter 2014 was intensely promotional, and those promotions were a key driver of digital channel sales last year. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on achieving our digital channel sales goals through a combination of both traffic growth and conversion improvement. 
REDcard penetration was 22.1% in the second quarter, about 130 basis points ahead of last year. Portfolio delinquency and write-off metrics are at historically low levels, and we continue to see an increase in payment rates. This means the size of the portfolio continues to slowly decline, but better-than-expected risk metrics are offsetting this impact. As a result, profit sharing income on the portfolio was up this quarter compared to last year. 
One other note. This week, we began accepting EMV or chip-card transactions at all stores across the country. As a result, this quarter, we will initiate the process of replacing all of our REDcard products with chip-and-PIN cards, including our private label credit and debit products.
While sales were in line with expectations, our second quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.9% was much stronger than expected. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was half a point higher than a year ago, right on our guidance. 
Consistent with the first quarter, this year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we annualized last year's post-breach promotional activity, and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature categories. 
I mentioned this last quarter, but I want to emphasize it once again. It is really important that we've been able to grow our traffic and sales even as we cycle over very intense promotions last year. Beyond the benefit of growing sales, there is a compelling gross margin benefit from growing our signature categories 3 times as fast as the company, which more than offsets the pressure on our cost of goods for investments in quality, innovation and presentation.
On the SG&A expense line, we had a standout quarter, with rate improvement of about 60 basis points compared with last year. This performance was driven by outstanding discipline across the enterprise, combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives. These benefits more than offset a 40 basis point headwind from incentive compensation, which was unusually low in the second quarter of 2014 in light of the financial performance we were experiencing at the time. 
As I noted earlier, marketing expense timing was a meaningful benefit this quarter as last year's second quarter spending was unusually high to support our promotions. And this year, we've retimed some spending into the third quarter in support of our Back-to-School licenses in TargetStyle.
This timing shift benefited our second quarter SG&A rate by about 30 basis points or about half our overall rate favorability, and we expect this shift will reverse in the third quarter.
Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our quarter-end inventory position, which was about 4% above last year. This reflects a meaningful improvement from the 9% year-over-year increase we reported at the end of first quarter, driven by issues at the West Coast ports. While we made a lot of progress in the second quarter, the year-over-year increases moderated even further so far in August as our quarter-end inventory supported Back-to-School sales that moved into early August as a result of retiming of some tax-free holidays. Bottom line, we feel very good about our overall inventory levels in relation to our sales plans. However, we have a big opportunity to improve in-stock levels, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
One note. You'll see on the balance sheet that we've moved pharmacy inventory into the other current assets line in all periods, reflecting their current status as held-for-sale pending the close of our transaction with CVS. 
Moving to consolidated metrics. Second quarter interest expense was $148 million, flat to second quarter 2014, excluding last year's $285 million charge for early debt retirement. We paid second quarter dividends of $331 million, up 22% from last year, and we invested another $675 million to retire shares. That adds up to a total of $1 billion returned to our shareholders this quarter, representing more than 130% of net income.
Looking ahead, with healthy business results and an ample cash position, we expect to have the capacity to continue to returning a meaningful amount of cash through both dividends and share repurchases within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
As anticipated, given our continued desire to repurchase shares, in the second quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.
As of quarter end, under this program, we have retired more than 65 million shares at an average price of just over $67 a share for a total investment of about $4.4 billion. With the expansion of the program, we expect to have sufficient repurchase authority well into next year, including any potential repurchase resulting from the proceeds of the CVS transaction.
Regarding that transaction, things are continuing as expected as we work with CVS and regulators to advance the process of getting approval for the sale. Given the uncertainty of potential timing for regulatory approval and the closing of the transaction, the guidance we provide today does not reflect any expected impacts of the transaction, which includes application of proceeds and removal of prescription sales, costs and assets from our financial statements.
As I described last quarter, this year, we began reporting return on invested capital from continuing operations, or ROIC, because we believe it is an important metric in assessing the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. And as we covered in the financial community meeting in March, our goal is to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next 5 years.
Not surprisingly, given our strong operating results, we reported a meaningful improvement in trailing 12-month ROIC this quarter as we grew 2 full percentage points to 13.3% compared with 11.3% a year ago.
Now let's move to our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. In the third quarter, we are cycling over stronger sales results from last year, both in stores and digital channels, and we expect the consumer and competitive environment to remain choppy. As a result, we are planning for a third quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, including expected digital channel sales growth of about 30%. We expect our third quarter gross margin rate to increase 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year, reflecting a continued mix from the signature category sales and the benefit from cycling last year's promotional activity, partially offset by investments in quality and price on our owned and exclusive brand products.
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our third quarter rate will be about flat to last year as the benefit from cost control is expected to be offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the shift in marketing spend from Q2.
Combining our gross margin and expense rate reductions, we're looking for improvement in our third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year.
Third quarter interest expense is expected to be approximately flat for last year, and tax expenses expect to increase by about $60 million, reflecting improved profitability and nonrecurring favorable tax items in third quarter last year.
Altogether, these expectations would lead to third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.89 compared with $0.79 a year ago. Note that this includes the impact of the shift in marketing timing, which translates to a $0.05 per share headwind in the third quarter. 
As we look ahead to the full year, we are certainly pleased with our results so far, which had been notably stronger than expected, and we've been pleased with comp performance so far this month, including Back-to-School sales which reflected retiming of some tax-free holidays into early August. 
At the same time, we remain mindful of the intensely competitive nature of our holiday season and have noted the inventory levels we're seeing at some competitors. Taking both of those factors into account, we are updating our guidance for the full year adjusted EPS to $4.60 to $4.75, a $0.10 increase compared with the prior range. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to pause and comment on my priorities as I enter the new role as Chief Operations Officer next month. As Brian mentioned, the #1 priority for my new team is to improve the way our supply chain functions from end to end. Achieving this goal will lead to many benefits, perhaps the most visible of which is an improvement in our in-stocks. Given the breadth and complexity of our business, it will always be a challenge to be in stock on every item in every store, in every moment of every day.
But our guest need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials and unfortunately, in the last couple of quarters, our in-stocks have been deteriorating. This challenge is understandable because we've been asking our supply chain to move well beyond its original design and become more flexible in the way we serve our guests. However, while we understand the reasons, the simple fact is that our current performance is unacceptable. 
So beginning this quarter, my team will be looking for both quick and more comprehensive solutions to make improvements in the supply chain, both this year and over time. And beyond this initial effort, we will work to ensure that our operations and strategy move in lockstep, enabling us to serve our guests in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. I look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months and years. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. And now Brian, Cathy, and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

Related to the supply chain, there is -- the team has done a great job responding to the needs of the organization over time to develop more flexible ways to meet the needs of our guests and really fulfill on-demand shopping.

But we've really been focusing on a handful of areas where we recognize we need to change our assortment, change our presentation, be more relevant and really recognize the needs and the demographics of these local markets. So there's a handful of categories I might lift up. One, craft beer, and really making sure that in a category like craft beer, we have locally relevant items and we recognize that even in a market like Chicago, those need to be tailored neighborhood-by-neighborhood. So we've looked at specialty foods, we've looked at categories like craft beer. We've looked at categories like patio and grills and recognizing that in the suburbs of Chicago, we can offer and should have in store large patio sets, 5-burner grills. But for our stores located in more of the urban neighborhoods of Chicago, we need bistro tables and we need 2-burner grills because those guests are living in condos and apartments, they've got small patios, and we need to make sure we tailor our assortment and our presentation to recognize their needs and to make sure we're more locally relevant. So we're certainly spending a lot of time looking at food, and as we think about the food reinvention, a lot of this is going to be driven by making sure we have locally relevant brands, those hometown favorites, and also in broader categories like patio and furniture, making sure that we're matching up our assortment in store with the needs of that local guest. So a lot of additional work for us to do, but we're really pleased with the progress. And I talked about a 1- to 2-point lift versus the test and control stores, that is a very important measure for us to continue to evaluate. And working with John and our merch team, we'll be looking to rapidly roll out the learning from Chicago into other relevant markets. From a digital standpoint, David, obviously, we continue to see really positive responses to some of our efforts like Cartwheel. And Cartwheel has now been downloaded over 18 million times. And every time I'm in stores, I run into guests that have their smartphone in their hand and they're looking for their offers from Cartwheel. But we also recognize that Target is a brand that's talked about in social media every day, thousands of times every day. So if you were to visit our headquarters here in Minneapolis, just down the hall from my office, we have what we call ""guest central."" It's our guest command center, where we're monitoring what people are talking about, what they're blogging about, how Target's being referenced in the news, and we're making sure we're very engaged with those bloggers and making sure that we're in the discussion. So it's a very important part of how we think about the brand and making sure that we incorporate social into our overall brand development initiatives."

We're getting great feedback from the guest. As I think about the third quarter, we expect plaid to be a really exciting initiative and the buzz that we're seeing already is really positive. So we've got work to do on Food, but when we reinvent Food and get the assortment right there and improve the presentation, I think that gives us all great confidence that we're going to continue to drive traffic to our stores and that's going to convert to really solid and sustainable comps."

But in fact, we've -- there's a couple of areas where we have invested hours back into the store as we put in the whole merchandising sets.

Followin",2327,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we step back and look at our third quarter results and our year-to-date performance, it's clear that our strategy is working, and we're delivering on the financial commitments we laid out last March. 
Following an extended period of declines, traffic has turned positive over the last 4 quarters and has been accelerating on a 2-year basis. Sales in signature categories had been growing much faster than our overall sales, and they are clearly exceeding industry benchmarks. So while consumers continue to spend cautiously, we feel confident as we enter the holiday season, and we're focused on continue to deliver on both our strategic priorities and our financial goals. 
As we mentioned in our last conference call, our third quarter plans were based on the knowledge that we were facing stronger prior year comparisons than we had experienced earlier in the year. Now with the quarter behind us, I'm pleased to report that not only did we meet our forecast, we saw continued progress on our strategy. 
Specifically, 2-year growth trends in comp sales, traffic and signature category performances each accelerated in the third quarter following strong performance in the second quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.86 was 8.6% higher than last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. 
Third quarter comparable sales were up 1.9%, also near the high end of our guidance and driven primarily by growth in traffic. We're really pleased that our guests are responding to the investments we're making in our assortment, presentation and shopping experience, and we're focused on building on this year's traffic increases in both stores and our digital platforms in the quarters and years ahead. 
Our third quarter gross margin rate was down slightly to last year, reflecting the benefits of a favorable merchandising mix and the comparison over last year's intense promotional markdowns. These benefits were offset by reimbursement pressure in pharmacy combined with the impact of investments in quality and innovation on our own and exclusive brands. 
Third quarter SG&A expenses were solid and in line with our expectation as Cathy will cover in a few minutes. We report a very healthy after-tax return on invested capital of 13% this quarter, nearly 2 percentage points higher than a year ago as progress on our strategic priorities has driven improved profitability on a relatively stable base in invested capital. 
Given this favorable performance, we continue to have capacity to invest in our business while returning a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders. This quarter, we will return well over $1 billion through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to well over $3 billion so far this year. 
Consistent with our guidance, our third quarter comp sales increase was somewhat smaller than in the second quarter. From a category perspective, the entire change of pace in sales was attributable to Apparel and Electronics. 
In Apparel, third quarter comp sales grew just under 3% compared with nearly 5% in the second quarter. This slowdown was correlated with warm weather in September followed by a reacceleration when somewhat cooler temperatures arrived in October. 
In the electronic category, we saw a double-digit decline in the third quarter comp sales. This performance reflects the comparison over last year's most intense electronic promotions, which occurred in August and the continued softness in tablets, consistent with industry trends. One standout in Electronics was wearable devices, part of the signature Wellness category, where we saw nearly 100% growth in comparable sales. Another standout was our toy category, part of the signature kids business, which matched its second quarter growth with another 12% comp sales increase this quarter. 
Beyond strength in light Electronics, growth in choice was broad based across multiple set of categories, including small dolls, LEGO, action toys and board games. 
We were also pleased with third quarter results from Seasonal programs, beginning with solid performance in Back-to-School and Back-to-College all the way through Halloween, when we saw very strong increases in costumes and decor and solid growth in Candy. 
And to show you why we're so excited about the upcoming Star Wars release, we had the #1 market share in Star Wars when we launched our assortment back in September. 
Looking through the lens of our category roles, third quarter comp sales growth was led by signature categories, which grew more than 2.5x as fast as our overall sales. And as I mentioned, given the tougher prior year comparisons, our 2-year stack comps in signature categories were stronger in the third quarter than either of the first 2 quarters of this year. 
Beyond toys and wearable Electronics, our third quarter standouts within signature included Baby and kids Apparel, women's ready-to-wear and Wellness items in Food. 
In Food overall, for the first time this year, third quarter comp sales growth outpaced comp sales overall as our work to reinvigorate this category is beginning to shape our performance. In key categories like yogurt, where we added premium and better-for-you brands, we saw high single-digit comp sales increase in the third quarter. We saw similar comp increases in craft beer and wine, reflecting our work to enhancing the assortment and bring locally relevant brands to our guests. 
Looking forward, we'll continue to enhance our Food assortment with a focus on Wellness, local relevance and seasonally appropriate items. And following the holiday season, we'll begin testing changes to Food shopping environments and a set of 25 remodels scheduled for the L.A. market along with a set of Super Target remodels scheduled for next year. 
Digital sales increased 20% in the third quarter, contributing about 40 basis points to our comp sales increase. While significantly outpacing the industry, this performance was well below our expectation of 30% growth when -- which we outlined in the last call. 
As we look at the drivers of this performance, it's clear that third quarter softness in Electronics was particularly impactful online, and like our stores, digital sales growth in Apparel was slower during much of the quarter, correlating with the relatively warm weather across much of the country. We know that our digital investments drive engagement and sales in all of our channels, and we're pleased that our third quarter sales were at the high end of our expectation. However, we believe we have an opportunity accelerate digital transactions by enhancing the experience on target.com. 
Beyond our efforts to streamline the guest experience on our site, our team's rolling out initiatives that we expect to drive digital traffic and sales over time. And once again this holiday season, we expect to be offering free shipping on all digital orders. We're very pleased with the guest response to this offer a year ago, and we expect it to be a key differentiator for Target again this holiday season. Regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled, in a store or in a guest front porch, we know that vast majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled. 
For example, our guest access our brand through a digital devices both in advance of and during their trip to one of our stores. As a result, we don't think of digital as simply a selling channel but a critical enabler of the shopping experience in all of our channels. This has significant strategic applications, both in terms of organizational structure and the way we reward our team. 
Since I arrived last year, we have been evolving our approach to focus first on our core guests and build a total Target assortment that best serves the needs and expectations of our guests. Only after we determine the appropriate assortment do we plan on how to offer to each of our selling channels. 
Consider our efforts in signature categories. For more than a year now, we've been investing in these categories with the expectation that they will grow most rapidly, and we've seen this play out in all of our channels. In fact, even while our digital footprint remains relatively small, we're approaching $1 billion of annual sales in our Home category, making us one of the leading digital retailers in the space. 
As we look ahead to the holidays, we are excited about our merchandising and marketing plans, and we believe we'll further differentiate Target during a critical retail season. 
In hardlines, Toys has already turned in a terrific performance so far this year, and we expect this strength to continue throughout the fourth quarter when we typically generate half of our annual toy sales. This year, more than 50% of our toy assortment is exclusive to Target, including the exclusive BB-8 Droid from the upcoming Star Wars movie, which we expect to be a top seller. 
We're also bringing back our kids wish list app, this year with enhanced features to make it easy and fun for family and friends to shop for the perfect gift for every kid in their life. Our gift catalog, featuring more than 700 items, was distributed to 40 million guests this year through direct mail, newspaper and distribution in our stores. 
On Cartwheel, we are seeing great results from our daily toy deal, which is featuring a different toy at 50% off everyday through December 24. And finally, we're bringing everything together on our kids gifting hub on target.com, which is designed to make shopping easy for parents and gift givers while creating a destination that's fun and inspirational for kids. 
In Electronics, we're excited to be one of the few retailers offering the Apple Watch in stores this season, and we expect this item to be a top gift item in wearable categories. Also in wearables, we partnered with UNICEF to offer their kid power band, which encourages kids to get more active and based on the points they accumulate, improve the lives of kids around the world. 
We also expect Drone to be a big hit this season. So we're featuring nearly 20 in-store and about 4x as many online. 
We're planning for a big season in video games, a key gifting category where hardware prices continue to moderate and software libraries continue to grow. And in Entertainment, where we're very excited to be featuring a Target-exclusive version of Adele's new 25 release that features 3 bonus tracks available only at Target. 
As we enter the holiday season, about 1,400 of our stores are featuring mannequins in Apparel, which is about double the number we had a year ago. Also this year, we've enhanced the shopping experience by updating presentations in Home and Electronics in more than 200 additional stores for each group. So we feel great about the ability of our stores to showcase our assortment. 
And this year, when our guests shop at Target for the holidays, they'll find an assortment focused on 3 key things: entertaining, decorating and gifting. To support each of these themes, we've invested in quality and differentiation, featuring real marble, handcarved wood, copper accents and genuine leather. In fact, more than 20% of our holiday gifting items are handcrafted this year. 
In Food, we're highlighting exclusive brands and flavors, including Republic of Wine, our new exclusive brand, which features unique discoveries from around the world. We're rolling out plastic holiday and flavors in Archer Farms, and we're offering exclusive indulgent seasonal flavors from great national brand partners with M&M's, Hershey's, Dove and Ghirardelli. 
And finally, anticipation's building for Black Friday, which is just over a week away. Once again this year, we're opening our stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, and our team is already preparing to deliver a combination of great deals and a shopping experience that makes Target different from everyone else. 
But we're committed to offering compelling savings value beyond the traditional Black Friday event. Beginning this Sunday, we'll launch 10 days of deals on Electronics, kitchenware, Toys and more, which will run through Tuesday, December 1. 
This Sunday's weekly ad belongs to our deals, special deals from our Black Friday presale, which takes place on Wednesday, November 25. For our guest who prefer to shop digitally, all of our Black Friday deals will be offered on target.com. And finally, guests who spend $75 or more on Friday, November 27, will receive a voucher for 20% off on future purchases, redeemable from December 4 through the 13th. 
Last March, in our meeting with the financial community, we outlined our plan to grow profitably by focusing on a set of key enterprise priorities. And while we have much more work to do, we remain committed to that plan and are pleased with our progress so far. 
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, we've successfully grown traffic, sales and profits a bit faster than we originally expected by focusing on our core guests and providing them with differentiated assortment and the experience they expect and deserve, but we're not slowing down because we see enormous opportunity still ahead of us. We're going to continue to focus on elevating the assortment, quality and the presentation in our signature categories. 
Across every category, we'll differentiate Target's assortment by providing exclusive items from both our national branded partners and one-of-a-kind items from our outstanding product design and development team. And while we're encouraged with the recent acceleration in Food sales, we are still in the very early stages of our work to provide a unique assortment of fresh, local and healthy items to our guests. 
And finally, while I'm pleased that we've already made early progress in our efforts to improve our in-stock performance, I believe we've got a multiyear opportunity to improve our reliability, both in stores and in digital channels, by modernizing the way we work and refocusing on Retail fundamentals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to John Mulligan, who will discuss his team's early efforts to improve operations as well as John's priorities going forward. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our initial efforts to reinforce our Retail fundamentals, particularly our in-stock position, and I'll cover our priorities and progress in our work to modernize the supply chain in support of our strategic initiatives. 
The good news is that while we have lots of work still ahead of us, we have seen meaningful improvement in key in-stock measures based on changes we've made in the last few months. While we strive to be in stock on every item in every store throughout every day, we know that need-based commodity categories are the most critical. If our guests don't believe that they can rely on Target to have their shopping list items available every time they shop, they'll begin to skip some trips to Target even though they enjoy shopping our more discretionary categories. 
As a result, when in-stock metrics on our core commodity categories began deteriorating this year, we created an out-of-stock action team to conduct deep dives by category to identify both short-term and long-term solutions. When a team identify solutions within a category, we can quickly test them to confirm they improve our performance and then determine if those solutions can be applied more broadly. 
This team focused first on our household, personal, Baby category and more recently, they've done work on our center store Grocery category. In a short amount of time, they've identified opportunities related to the way we generate vendor orders, optimize trade-offs between order quantities and frequency and our reliance on system-generated solutions versus manual processes. 
In high-volume stores, the team has implemented adjustments to planograms to enhance holding capacity on fast-earnings SKUs, reducing the need for frequent store replenishment. And in our distribution centers, the team has identified opportunities to reduce lead times variability, tighten delivery windows and, in some cases, increase safety stock on key items. 
I should note that this increase in safety stock is one of the drivers of the 4% inventory growth we reported at the end of the quarter. In a very short time, the results of our efforts have been encouraging. In household, personal, Baby, we've been able to reduce overall out-of-stock measures by approximately 50% in about 8 weeks. In centers for Grocery, in less than a month, the team was able to reduce out of stock measures by about 25%, and importantly, we've been able to reduce out of stock even further on the items most important to our guests. 
Given these encouraging initial results, the team is moving quickly to scale these solutions to a broader set of categories throughout the store and conducting additional deep dives in categories like Health & Beauty. Looking ahead, the team has a number of key priorities, including work to optimize case stacks, which will better accommodate variability in store sales volumes across our network. 
In addition, they are implementing technology and process improvement to improve count integrity throughout our stores and distribution network. Included in these efforts will be a test of RFID technology in a few of our Apparel categories to gauge the effectiveness of the technology relative to the cost of implementation. This work is being supported by the rollout of financial technology development in partnership with Mike McNamara, our new Chief Information Officer, and our newly hired Senior Vice President of Operational Excellence, Anu Gupta. We are very excited to have Anu on the team. She has more than 20 years of relevant experience in driving operational excellence by leveraging best practices in a variety of operating models, including procurement and Lean Six Sigma process redesign across a range of industries, including Retail. 
We're confident Anu will accelerate the efforts of the outstanding team we already have in place. Beyond our work to improve reliability, our store teams are working diligently to support Target's efforts to become more flexible in the way we fulfill guest demand. As a result of last year's rollout of ship-from-store capability, stores have already shipped more than 10 million items directly to guests so far this year, and the percent of digital orders delivered in a 3-day window has more than doubled compared with the year ago. 
To showcase this improvement in our capabilities, last quarter, we rolled out new functionality we call available to promise, which offers guests a more precise shipping window. With available to promise, we expect nearly 2/3 of our digital orders to offer a guest a delivery window of 3 business days or fewer compared with our typical window of 4 to 7 business days prior to the rollout. We recently expanded our ship-from-store capability to more than 300 additional stores, bringing the total to more than 1/4 of the chain. This will enable about 40% of digital transactions to be shipped from our stores in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, 2 new direct-to-guest fulfillment centers became operational in the third quarter in advance of the holiday season. With the expanded capacity these changes provide, we expect to continue making progress on shipping speed next year. 
As Brian mentioned, most of our store sales are digitally enabled so we continue to integrate digital experiences into the stores. Guests increasingly use Cartwheel, our digital savings app with more than 20 million authenticated users to plan their store trips in advance and then use the app to search for additional deals while shopping in store. 
In addition, because 10% to 15% of our digital orders are picked up in stores, we are exploring ways to streamline the pickup process by expanding holding capacity that the service counter and implementing process improvements to reduce wait times. For next year's L.A. 25 remodels, we will feature all of our latest merchandising enhancements. We will test changes to the front end that will make order pickup even more convenient, including dedicated ambassadors to help store guests better understand Target's digital capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I want to thank our store and distribution center teams for their great performance so far this year and for their current efforts to ensure we provide an outstanding guest experience this holiday season. It's an enormous challenge for both our stores and distribution teams to accommodate the surge in volumes we see at Black Friday. 
But our store teams don't focus only on moving merchandise. They focus first on our guests and do an amazing amount of preparation to ensure guests have a pleasant and safe experience. It's one of the many things that makes Target unique and one of the reasons why guests love our stores and our brand. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,310466888,905709,"Target Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are pleased that this quarter's performance was near the high end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS. As is often the case, when you get into the detailed P&L, there were some",2209,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are pleased that this quarter's performance was near the high end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS. As is often the case, when you get into the detailed P&L, there were some ins and outs within the quarter that generally offset each other, which I'll cover in a few minutes. 
This quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.86 above the midpoint of our guidance range and 8.6% above last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.76, $0.10 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.05 of asset impairment, $0.03 of data breach expense and $0.02 related to the corporate restructuring we announced last spring. 
Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.87 compared with the $0.55 a year ago as this year, we recognized $0.11 of tax benefit related to our investment losses in Canada while last year, we incurred $0.27 of after-tax losses related to Canadian operations. 
Let's turn to third quarter segment results. Among the drivers of our 1.9% comparable sales growth, we are pleased that traffic grew a very healthy 1.4% in the third quarter. This growth is even more encouraging when we look at performance on a 2-year basis as we faced a tougher comparison in the third quarter than either of the first 2 quarters of the year. 
October marked our 12th straight month of traffic growth, and we are laser focused on this metric as a key indicator of the health of our business over time. Breaking out our sales growth between stores and our digital platforms, the stores accounted for a little over 3/4 of our comparable sales growth, while digital contributed about 40 basis points to our third quarter comp. 
Consistent with results from earlier in the year, our digital growth continues to be driven by a meaningful improvement in conversion. And although we have seen an acceleration in the last 2 months, we haven't seen a growth in digital traffic we expected to see this year. 
We believe our biggest opportunity to drive traffic continues to be our work to streamline and enhance the digital experience. 
Third quarter REDcard penetration was 22.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago, and we remain on track to meet our guidance for an increase of 100 basis points or more for the full year. As you'll recall, we tested REDcard rewards in the Kansas City market for a year before we launched the program nationwide. With the benefit of that head start, penetration in Kansas City continues to run well ahead of the rest of the country, giving us confidence that we have continued room to grow this rewards program in the years ahead. 
In addition, we are optimistic that the industry's move to EMV or chip-and-pin technology will help restore confidence in the U.S. payment system and increase the willingness of consumers to add new cards to their wallet. Regarding our move to EMV, we are pleased to be one of only a few large retailers in the United States that are accepting chip cards for both credit and debit transactions in advance of this holiday season. 
We've already reissued chip cards to about half of our Target branded debit and credit card holders, and we expect to complete the rollout early next year, following a pause for the holiday season. 
Our third quarter segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were both about 20 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our guidance as strong SG&A performance offset the impact of a lower-than-expected gross margin rate. 
On the gross margin line, third quarter performance was about 10 basis points below last year, short of our expectations. While we continue to benefit from the comparison to last year's promotions, the benefit is waning as the intensity of those promotions begin to taper in the third quarter last year. 
In addition, consistent with results from earlier in the year, we're seeing continued margin pressure from quality investments in our own and exclusive brand. Finally, this quarter, we saw a reimbursement pressure in our pharmacy business, which we expect to continue until we complete the sale of this business to CVS. 
I want to pause for a moment and comment on the CVS transaction. We continue to work closely with the CVS team to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction. And while we don't have an update on the potential timing for the transaction to close, we are pleased with our progress to date. 
Turning back to the third quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we saw unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter, about 30 basis points lower than last year. As part of our efforts to control costs, this quarter's expense rate benefited from the discontinuation of an outdated little-used retiree medical plan, but we also saw this across the organization, which drove outstanding underlying performance. 
Even on the marketing line, where some expenses were retimed into the third quarter from the second quarter last year, we recognized savings in other programs that led to overall favorability compared with last year. 
As John mentioned and consistent with last quarter, our inventory position at the end of the third quarter was about 4% above last year. This reflects a significant improvement from the higher year-over-year increases we were seeing earlier this year. 
And while inventory growth is slightly higher than our pace of sales, it reflects changes in receipt timing compared with last year combined with the intentional investments we're making in commodity categories to improve our in-stock position. As a result, we feel very good about our inventory position going into the holiday season in relation to both our sales plans and our work to improve in-stock reliability. 
Turning back to consolidated metrics. Third quarter interest expense was $151 million, $5 million higher than last year. Our third quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 34.3%, up from 30.6% last year when we recognized a $30 million benefit from the resolution of tax matters. 
We paid third quarter dividends of $352 million, up about 7% from last year. And given our cash position and continued strong business results, we had the opportunity to invest another $942 million in share repurchase this quarter. 
Given our long-range plan to generate profitable growth, we believe the continued opportunity to retire shares will prove to be a productive use of cash. To illustrate that point, under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we have retired more than 77 million shares, representing more than 12% of our current shares outstanding at an average price of less than $69. 
As Brian mentioned, our after-tax return on invested capital, or ROIC, was a very healthy 13% for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter. This is nearly 2 percentage points higher than last year when our business results were under pressure following the data breach. 
Given our plan to generate profitable growth on a relatively stable base of invested capital, we expect to continue to grow this metric over time with a goal to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter and what that guidance implies for our expected full year performance. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we're mindful that the consumer remains cautious, and there are indications of heavy inventory levels at some competitors. However, we remain focused on the things we can control and what has been working all year. 
These include our ability to deliver on our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise by offering great products at a compelling value, iconic marketing that guests love and an outstanding store experience that differentiates Target from everyone else. With that context, we expect to deliver a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, consistent with our third quarter guidance. 
Underlying that guidance, we expect digital growth of about 20%, consistent with our third quarter performance. 
Before I move down -- further down the Q4 P&L, I want to pause and discuss a challenge we hear a lot, which is based on the acceleration in 2-year stack performance we're planning for the fourth quarter. John answered this question last call, but I think it's worth addressing in more detail today. 
Last year, our fourth quarter comparable sales growth was 3.8%, but that was on top of a 2.5% sales decline in the fourth quarter 2013 when we announced the data breach on the weekend before Christmas. So while the announcement of multiyear sales performance isn't always useful, I think in this case, it's important to think about a 3-year stack of our comp sales. 
Specifically, if we hit the midpoint of our fourth quarter sales guidance, the simple 3-year stack would be a 2.8% comp, slightly less than the 3% 3-year stack we've delivered year-to-date. So while there are always risks to every sales forecast, we don't believe the 2-year stack provides useful insight in this case. 
Moving back to the P&L. We expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate to be flat to down slightly from last year's 9.8% rate. Among the drivers of EBITDA margins, we expect a moderate gross margin rate decline to be offset by a similar improvement in our SG&A expense rate this quarter. 
We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be consistent with our third quarter, and our tax rate is expectedly -- is expected to be approximately 34% as we annualized over last year's favorable resolution of tax matters. 
With our current cash position and expected business results, we plan to continue repurchasing our shares this quarter, and we will continue to manage the magnitude and pace of repurchase activity with the goal of maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. 
Altogether, this performance would lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.48 to $1.58 compared with $1.49 in fourth quarter 2014. 
Let's look at what this guidance implies for our expectations for full year 2015 financial performance, which I'll compare to the guidance we provided at our financial community meeting last March. At that meeting, we laid out an expectation for 2015 comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Given our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect our full year comp to remain firmly in that range. 
I would note that the channel mix of our sales has been different than expectations, specifically with year-to-date digital sales growth of 29% and our expected 20% growth in the fourth quarter, it's clear that in 2015, we don't expect to attain the longer-term 40% goal we laid out in March. However, we've delivered on our overall comparable sales goal every quarter this year, and we still expect to deliver industry-leading digital sales growth, both important benchmarks for us. 
In March, we laid out an expectation to grow our segment EBITDA margin rate by 20 to 30 basis points for the year, and we are on track to outperform that expectation with growth closer to 40 to 50 basis points in 2015. 
Regarding capital deployment, we are on track to meet our guidance for 5% to 10% dividend growth this year, and we've already met our goal for $2 billion or more in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of the year. 
And finally, we told you in March that we expected to generate $4.45 to $4.65 in adjusted EPS for the year. And despite a challenging backdrop, with our updated guidance today, we are positioned to deliver performance at the high end of or above that range for the year. 
Beyond my love for the brand, I was attracted to Target because of our singular focus on delighting our guests and our tremendous desire to win. It's evident across our stores, line team, distribution centers and headquarters. 
I recently visited one of our stores and have the opportunity to meet Bev, who has been with the company for an amazing 44 years. In her current role, Bev is involved in the ship-from-store process, and she says their whole team loves this new capability because it allows our stores to drive sales by serving guests in new ways. 
Now that I've been immersed in our business for the past 3 months, I'm mindful of the opportunity ahead of us and the work we still need to do to accomplish, but I'm encouraged by the progress we've seen already. Traffic has increased for the full year. Signature categories are leading our sales every quarter, and with a renewed focus on Retail fundamentals and the dedication of team members like Bev, we are delivering on our vision to provide shopping on demand while maintaining our focus on everyday in-stock reliability across our store network. 
The ultimate measure of this year's accomplishments can be seen in our earnings. We've delivered a 16.9% increase in our adjusted earnings per share so far this year, and with our fourth quarter guidance, we were well positioned to deliver double-digit growth for the year. We're excited about this initial progress, and we remain laser focused on building on this momentum over time. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

The outlook that for e-commerce growth in the fourth quarter is somewhere between 6% and 8%. So while our 20% growth rate is not in line with our expectations, it's still dramatically outperforming the industry, and I think the most important measure we're looking at is the fact that over 80% of our guests start their shopping journey online, either at home on their desktop or with the mobile device, and that digitally influenced guests is coming into our stores more often. So as we've talked about our strategy, our strategy is to make sure we allow our guest to shop anywhere, anytime they want with Target. And what we're seeing right now is they're voting with their feet to spend more time in our stores. They're downloading our Cartwheel app, 20 million downloads so far to date. So I think we're seeing an overall slowdown in digital growth across Retail, and we're really pleased that we continue to outpace the industry, dramatically outpace the industry, but our digital efforts are driving more traffic into our stores and helping us grow our overall comps. So while there's been a slowdown broadly across the center, we continue to outpace the industry, and that's our fundamental goal."

And while 3% in Q3 was slightly less than the growth rate we saw in the second quarter, compared to many of our peers, we recognize that we're continuing to build traffic and growth in important Apparel category. So the work we've done with mannequins, with changing the in-store experience clearly paying off. One of the changes that we've announced recently is the addition of 1,400 visual merchandisers to make sure we combine the change in the ranking with mannequins and fixtures and layouts with experts in store that can maintain that great in-store merchandising experience. So that's a new benchmark for us. We're standing it up for the holidays. We expect that they continue to strengthen the in-store experience, and we know with our signature categories, we're still at the very, very early stages of standing up our Wellness position, but we feel like we're in an excellent position with Baby and kids, feel very good about our performance in the third quarter with kids Apparel. Certainly, toys has been a highlight throughout the year, and we feel as if we're well positioned coming off of second and third quarter comps in toys that we're up 12%, the reaction we've seen from the guest to our store Star Wars assortment, where we've captured an industry-leading position and expect to be a destination during the holidays. So while we still have much more work to do, we feel very good about the progress we're making in signature categories, and I think the addition of visual merchandisers in store will help us maintain our merchandising appeal throughout the holidays."

Now we've actually seen Food comp acceleration throughout the year. And while we haven't made major changes with fixtures and in-store decor, we've been very focused on assortment changes and bringing more natural, organic, local items into many of our categories, and we're seeing the guest react very favorably. So to me, it's getting the basics right. And before we start making fixture changes and decor changes, it has to start with the right assortment and making sure we have the items, the brands our guest is looking for when they shop food at Target. So the acceleration you're seeing right now is driven by section by section, getting the assortment right, bringing more appealing items to our guests, adding more natural, organic, gluten-free items that are on trend to those categories. We made some significant changes in yogurt in the third quarter and saw very, very positive responses, high single-digit growth rates in those categories. So while we're not shouting about it, we're making steady progress in Food. We'll learn a lot more in 25 stores in Los Angeles, where you will see some changes in fixtures and decor. And as we learn, we'll continue to grow. So I think we do have significant upside, but Scott, this is about making sure we get it right, and we're going to take a slow, steady approach, solid, consistent results every quarter and continue to deliver what the guest is looking for from an assortment experience standpoint when they shop food at Target."

As we mentioned in our last conference call, our third quarter plans were based on the knowledge that we were facing stronger prior year comparisons than we had experienced earlier in the year. Now with the quarter behind us, I'm pleased to report that, not only did we meet our forecast, we saw continued progress on our strategy. 
Specifically, 2-year growth trends in comp sales, traffic and signature category performances each accelerated in the third quarter following strong performance in the second quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.86 was 8.6% higher than last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. 
Third quarter comparable sales were up 1.9%, also near the high end of our guidance and driven primarily by growth in traffic. We're really pleased that our guests are responding to the investments we're making in our assortment, presentation and shopping experience, and we're focused on building on this year's traffic increases in both stores and our digital platforms in the quarters and years ahead. 
Our third quarter gross margin rate was down slightly to last year, reflecting the benefits of a favorable merchandising mix and the comparison over last year's intense promotional markdowns. These benefits were offset by reimbursement pressure in pharmacy combined with the impact of investments in quality and innovation on our own and exclusive brands. 
Third quarter SG&A expenses were solid and in line with our expectation as Cathy will cover in a few minutes. We report a very healthy after-tax return on invested capital of 13% this quarter, nearly 2 percentage points higher than a year ago as progress on our strategic priorities has driven improved profitability on a relatively stable base in invested capital. 
Given this favorable performance, we continue to have capacity to invest in our business while returning a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders. This quarter, we will return well over $1 billion through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to well over $3 billion so far this year. 
Consistent with our guidance, our third quarter comp sales increase was somewhat smaller than in the second quarter. From a category perspective, the entire change of pace in sales was attributable to Apparel and Electronics. 
In Apparel, third quarter comp sales grew just under 3% compared with nearly 5% in the second quarter. This slowdown was correlated with warm weather in September followed by a reacceleration when somewhat cooler temperatures arrived in October. 
In the Electronics category, we saw a double-digit decline in the third quarter comp sales. This performance reflects the comparison over last year's most intense electronic promotions, which occurred in August, and the continued softness in tablets, consistent with industry trends. One standout in Electronics was wearable devices, part of the signature Wellness category, where we saw nearly 100% growth in comparable sales. Another standout was our Toy category, part of the signature kids business, which matched its second quarter growth with another 12% comp sales increase this quarter. Beyond strength in Light Electronics, growth in choice was broad based across multiple subcategories, including small dolls, LEGO, action toys and board games. 
We were also pleased with third quarter results from Seasonal programs, beginning with solid performance in Back-to-School and Back-to-College all the way through Halloween, when we saw very strong increases in costumes and decor and solid growth in Candy. 
And to show you why we're so excited about the upcoming Star Wars release, we had the #1 market share in Star Wars when we launched our sword back in September. 
Looking through the lens of our category roles, third quarter comp sales growth was led by signature categories, which grew more than 2.5x as fast as our overall sales. And as I mentioned, given the tougher prior year comparisons, our 2-year stack comps in signature categories were stronger in the third quarter than either of the first 2 quarters of this year. 
Beyond toys and wearable Electronics, our third quarter standouts within signature included Baby and Kids Apparel, women's ready-to-wear and Wellness items in Food. 
In Food overall, for the first time this year, third quarter comp sales growth outpaced comp sales overall as our work to reinvigorate this category is beginning to shape our performance. In key categories like yogurt, where we added premium and better-for-you brands, we saw a high single-digit comp sales increase in the third quarter. We saw similar comp increases in craft beer and wine, reflecting our work to enhance the assortment and bring locally relevant brands to our guests. Looking forward, we'll continue to enhance our Food assortment with a focus on Wellness, local relevance and seasonally appropriate items. And following the holiday season, we'll begin testing changes to Food shopping environments in a set of 25 remodels scheduled for the L.A. market along with a set of SuperTarget remodels scheduled for next year. 
Digital sales increased 20% in the third quarter, contributing about 40 basis points to our comp sales increase. While significantly outpacing the industry, this performance was well below our expectation of 30% growth when we -- which we outlined in the last call. 
As we look at the drivers of this performance, it's clear the third quarter softness in Electronics was particularly impactful online. And like our stores, digital sales growth in Apparel was slower during much of the quarter, correlating with the relatively warm weather across much of the country. We know that our digital investments drive engagement and sales in all of our channels, and we're pleased that our third quarter sales were at the high end of our expectation. However, we believe we have an opportunity to accelerate digital transactions by enhancing the experience on target.com. 
Beyond our efforts to streamline the guest experience on our site, our team is rolling out multiple initiatives that we expect to drive digital traffic and sales over time. And once again, this holiday season, we expect to be offering free shipping on all digital orders. We're very pleased with the guest response to this offer a year ago, and we expect it to be a key differentiator for Target again this holiday season. Regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled, in a store or in a guest front porch, we know the vast majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled. For example, our guest access our brands through a digital device both in advance of and during their trip to one of our stores. As a result, we don't think of digital as simply a selling channel, but a critical enabler for the shopping experience in all of our channels. This has significant strategic implications, both in terms of organizational structure and the way we reward our team. 
Since I arrived last year, we have been evolving our approach to focus first on our core guests and build a total Target assortment that best serves the needs and expectations to our guests. Only after we've determined the appropriate assortment do we plan on how to offer to each of our selling channels. 
Consider our efforts in signature categories. For more than a year now, we've been investing in these categories with the expectation that they will grow most rapidly, and we've seen this play out in all of our channels. In fact, even while our digital footprint remains relatively small, we're approaching $1 billion of annual sales in our Home category, making us one of the leading digital retailers in the space. 
As we look ahead to the holidays, we are excited about our merchandising and marketing plans, and we believe we'll further differentiate Target during a critical retail season. 
In Hardlines, toys has already turned in a terrific performance so far this year, and we expect this strength to continue throughout the fourth quarter when we typically generate half of our annual toy sales. This year, more than 15% of our toy assortment is exclusive to Target, including the exclusive BB-8 Droid from the upcoming Star Wars movie, which we expect to be a top seller. 
We're also bringing back our kid's Wish List app this year with enhanced features to make it easy and fun for family and friends to shop for the perfect gift for every kid in their life. Our gift catalog featuring more than 700 items was distributed to 40 million guests this year through direct mail, newspaper and distribution in our stores. 
On Cartwheel, we are seeing great results from our daily toy deal, which is featuring a different toy at 50% off everyday through December 24. And finally, we're bringing everything together on our kid's gifting hub on target.com, which is designed to make shopping easy for parents and gift givers while create a destination that's fun and inspirational for kids. 
In Electronics, we're excited to be one of the few retailers offering the Apple Watch in stores this season, and we expect this item to be a top gift item in wearable categories. Also in wearables, we partnered with UNICEF to offer their kids power band, which encourages kids to get more active and based on the points they accumulate, improve the lives of kids around the world. 
We also expect Drone to be a big hit this season. So we're featuring nearly 20 in-store and about 4x as many online. 
We're planning for a big season in video games, a key gifting category where hardware prices continue to moderate and software libraries continue to grow. And in Entertainment, where we're very excited to be featuring a Target-exclusive version of Adele's new 25 release that features 3 bonus tracks available only at Target. 
As we enter the holiday season, about 1,400 of our stores are featuring mannequins in Apparel, which is about double the number we had a year ago. Also this year, we've enhanced the shopping experience by updating presentations in Home and Electronics in more than 200 additional stores for each group. So we feel great about the ability of our stores to showcase our assortment. 
And this year, when our guests shop at Target for the holidays, they'll find an assortment focused on 3 key things: entertaining, decorating and gifting. To support each of these themes, we've invested in quality and differentiation, featuring real marble, hand-carved wood, copper accents and genuine leather. In fact, more than 20% of our holiday gifting items are handcrafted this year. 
In Food, we're highlighting exclusive brands and flavors, including Republic of Wine, our new exclusive brand, which features unique discoveries from around the world. We're rolling out plastic holiday and hardwood flavors in Archer Farms, and we're offering exclusive indulgent seasonal flavors from great national brand partners with M&M's, Hershey's, Dove and Ghirardelli. 
And finally, anticipation's building for Black Friday, which is just over a week away. Once again, this year, we're opening our stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, and our team is already preparing to deliver a combination of great deals and a shopping experience that makes Target different from everyone else. 
But we're committed to offering compelling savings value beyond the traditional Black Friday event. Beginning this Sunday, we'll launch 10 days of deals on Electronics, Kitchenware, Toys and more, which will run through Tuesday, December 1. 
This Sunday's weekly ad will also reveal special deals from our Black Friday presale, which takes place on Wednesday, November 25. For our guest who prefer to shop digitally, all of our Black Friday deals will be offered on target.com. And finally, guests who spend $70 -- $75 or more on Friday, November 27, will receive a voucher for 20% off on future purchases, redeemable from December 4 through the 13th. 
Last March, in our meeting with the financial community, we outlined our plan to grow profitably by focusing on a set of key enterprise priorities. And while we have much more work to do, we remain committed to that plan and are pleased with our progress so far. 
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, we've successfully grown traffic, sales and profits a bit faster than we originally expected by focusing on our core guests and providing them with differentiated assortment and the experience they expect and deserve, but we're not slowing down because we see enormous opportunity still ahead of us. We're going to continue to focus on elevating the assortment, quality and the presentation in our signature categories. 
Across every category, we'll differentiate Target's assortment by providing exclusive items from both our national branded partners and one-of-a-kind items from our outstanding product design and development team. And while we're encouraged with the recent acceleration in Food sales, we are still in the very early stages of our work to provide a unique assortment of fresh, local and healthy items to our guests. 
And finally, while I'm pleased we've already made early progress in our efforts to improve our in-stock performance, I believe we've got a multiyear opportunity to improve our reliability, both in stores and in digital channels, by modernizing the way we work and refocusing on retail fundamentals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to John Mulligan, who will discuss his team's early efforts to improve operations as well as John's priorities going forward. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our initial efforts to reinforce our Retail fundamentals, particularly our in-stock position, and I'll cover our priorities and progress in our work to modernize the supply chain in support of our strategic initiatives. 
The good news is that while we have lots of work still ahead of us, we have seen meaningful improvement in key in-stock measures based on changes we've made in the last few months. While we strive to be in stock on every item in every store throughout every day, we know that need-based commodity categories are the most critical. If our guests don't believe that they can rely on Target to have their shopping list items available every time they shop, they'll begin to skip some trips to Target even though they enjoy shopping our more discretionary categories. 
As a result, when in-stock metrics on our core commodity categories began deteriorating this year, we created an out-of-stock action team to conduct deep dives by category to identify both short-term and long-term solutions. When a team identify solutions within a category, we can quickly test them to confirm they improve our performance and then determine if those solutions can be applied more broadly. 
This team focused first on our Household, Personal, Baby category and more recently, they've done work on our center store Grocery category. In a short amount of time, they have identified opportunities related to the way we generate vendor orders, optimize tradeoffs between order quantities and frequency and our reliance on system-generated solutions versus manual processes. 
In high-volume stores, the team has implemented adjustments to planograms to enhance holding capacity on fast-earnings SKUs, reducing the need for frequent store replenishment. And in our distribution centers, the team has identified opportunities to reduce lead-time variability, tighten delivery windows and, in some cases, increase safety stock on key items. 
I should note that this increase in safety stock is one of the drivers of the 4% inventory growth we reported at the end of the quarter. In a very short time, the results of our efforts have been encouraging. In Household, Personal, Baby, we've been able to reduce overall out-of-stock measures by approximately 50% in about 8 weeks. In centers for Grocery, in less than a month, the team was able to reduce out-of-stock measures by about 25% and importantly, we've been able to reduce out of stock even further on the items most important to our guests. 
Given these encouraging initial results, the team is moving quickly to scale these solutions to a broader set of categories throughout the store and conducting additional deep dives in categories like Health & Beauty. Looking ahead, the team has a number of key priorities, including work to optimize case stacks, which will better accommodate variability in store sales volumes across our network. 
In addition, they are implementing technology and process improvement to improve count integrity throughout our stores and distribution network. Included in these efforts will be a test of RFID technology in a few of our Apparel categories to gauge the effectiveness of the technology relative to the cost of implementation. This work is being supported by the rollout of an agile technology development in partnership with Mike McNamara, our new Chief Information Officer, and our newly hired Senior Vice President of Operational Excellence, Anu Gupta. We are very excited to have Anu on the team. She has more than 20 years of relevant experience in driving operational excellence by leveraging best practices in a variety of operating models, including procurement and Lean Six Sigma process redesign across a range of industries, including Retail. We're confident Anu will accelerate the efforts of the outstanding team we already have in place. 
Beyond our work to improve reliability, our store teams are working diligently to support Target's efforts to become more flexible in the way we fulfill guest demand. As a result of last year's rollout of ship-from-store capability, stores have already shipped more than 10 million items directly to guests so far this year, and the percent of digital orders delivered in a 3-day window has more than doubled compared with the year ago. To showcase this improvement in our capabilities, last quarter, we rolled out new functionality we call available to promise, which offers guests a more precise shipping window. With available to promise, we expect nearly 2/3 of our digital orders to offer a guest a delivery window of 3 business days or fewer compared with our typical window of 4 to 7 business days prior to the rollout. We recently expanded our ship-from-store capability to more than 300 additional stores, bringing the total to more than 1/4 of the chain. This will enable about 40% of digital transactions to be shipped from our stores in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, 2 new direct-to-guest fulfillment centers became operational in the third quarter in advance of the holiday season. With the expanded capacity these changes provide, we expect to continue making progress on shipping speed next year. 
As Brian mentioned, most of our store sales are digitally enabled, so we continue to integrate digital experiences into the stores. Guests increasingly use Cartwheel, our digital savings app with more than 20 million authenticated users to plan their store trips in advance and then use the app to search for additional deals while shopping in store. 
In addition, because 10% to 15% of our digital orders are picked up in stores, we are exploring ways to streamline the pickup process by expanding holding capacity at the service counter and implementing process improvements to reduce wait times. For next year's L.A. 25 remodels, we will feature all of our latest merchandising enhancements. We will test changes to the front end that will make pick -- order pickup even more convenient, including dedicated ambassadors to help store guests better understand Target's digital capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I want to thank our store and distribution center teams for their great performance so far this year and for their current efforts to ensure we provide an outstanding guest experience this holiday season. It's an enormous challenge for both our stores and distribution teams to accommodate the surge in volumes we see at Black Friday. 
But our store teams don't focus only on moving merchandise. They focus first on our guests and do an amazing amount of preparation to ensure guests have a pleasant and safe experience. It's one of the many things that makes Target unique and one of the reasons why guests love our stores and our brand. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,310466888,905843,"Target Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are pleased that this quarter's performance was near the high end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS.

As Brian mentioned earlier, we are pleased that this quarter's performance was near the high end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS. As is often the case, when you get into the detailed P&L, there were some ins and outs within the quarter that generally offset each other, which I'll cover in a few minutes. 
This quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.86 above the midpoint of our guidance range and 8.6% above last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.76, $0.10 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.05 of asset impairment, $0.03 of data breach expense and $0.02 related to the corporate restructuring we announced last spring. 
Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.87 compared with the $0.55 a year ago as, this year, we recognized $0.11 of tax benefit related to our investment losses in Canada. While last year, we incurred $0.27 of after-tax losses related to Canadian operations. 
Let's turn to third quarter segment results. Among the drivers of our 1.9% comparable sales growth, we are pleased that traffic grew a very healthy 1.4% in the third quarter. This growth is even more encouraging when we look at performance on a 2-year basis, as we faced a tougher comparison in the third quarter than either of the first 2 quarters of the year. 
October marked our 12th straight month of traffic growth, and we are laser-focused on this metric as a key indicator of the health of our business over time. Breaking out our sales growth between stores and our digital platforms, the stores accounted for a little over 3/4 of our comparable sales growth, while digital contributed about 40 basis points to our third quarter comp. Consistent with results from earlier in the year, our digital growth continues to be driven by a meaningful improvement in conversion. And although we have seen an acceleration in the last 2 months, we haven't seen a growth in digital traffic we expected to see this year. We believe our biggest opportunity to drive traffic continues to be our work to streamline and enhance the digital experience. 
Third quarter REDcard penetration was 22.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago, and we remain on track to meet our guidance for an increase of 100 basis points or more for the full year. As you'll recall, we tested REDcard rewards in the Kansas City market for a year before we launched the program nationwide. With the benefit of that head start, penetration in Kansas City continues to run well ahead of the rest of the country, giving us confidence that we have continued room to grow this rewards program in the years ahead. 
In addition, we are optimistic that the industry's move to EMV or chip-and-pin technology will help restore confidence in the U.S. payment system and increase the willingness of consumers to add new cards to their wallet. Regarding our move to EMV, we are pleased to be one of only a few large retailers in the United States that are accepting chip cards for both credit and debit transactions in advance of this holiday season. 
We've already reissued chip cards to about half of our Target-branded debit and credit card holders, and we expect to complete the rollout early next year, following a pause for the holiday season. 
Our third quarter segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were both about 20 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our guidance as strong SG&A performance offset the impact of a lower-than-expected gross margin rate. 
On the gross margin line, third quarter performance was about 10 basis points below last year, short of our expectations. While we continue to benefit from the comparison to last year's promotions, the benefit is waning as the intensity of those promotions began to taper in the third quarter last year. 
In addition, consistent with results from earlier in the year, we're seeing continued margin pressure from quality investments in our own and exclusive brands. Finally, this quarter, we saw a reimbursement pressure in our pharmacy business, which we expect to continue until we complete the sale of this business to CVS. 
I want to pause for a moment and comment on the CVS transaction. We continue to work closely with the CVS team to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction. And while we don't have an update on the potential timing for the transaction to close, we are pleased with our progress to date. 
Turning back to the third quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we saw unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter, about 30 basis points lower than last year. As part of our efforts to control costs, this quarter's expense rate benefited from the discontinuation of an outdated little-used retiree medical plan, but we also saw this across the organization, which drove outstanding underlying performance. 
Even on the marketing line, where some expenses were retimed into the third quarter from the second quarter last year, we recognized savings in other programs that led to overall favorability compared with last year. 
As John mentioned and consistent with last quarter, our inventory position at the end of the third quarter was about 4% above last year. This reflects a significant improvement from the higher year-over-year increases we were seeing earlier this year. And while inventory growth is slightly higher than our pace of sales, it reflects changes in receipt timing compared with last year combined with the intentional investments we're making in commodity categories to improve our in-stock position. As a result, we feel very good about our inventory position going into the holiday season in relation to both our sales plan and our work to improve in-stock reliability. 
Turning back to consolidated metrics. Third quarter interest expense was $151 million, $5 million higher than last year. Our third quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 34.3%, up from 30.6% last year when we recognized a $30 million benefit from the resolution of tax matters. 
We paid third quarter dividends of $352 million, up about 7% from last year. And given our cash position and continued strong business results, we had the opportunity to invest another $942 million in share repurchase this quarter. Given our long-range plan to generate profitable growth, we believe the continued opportunity to retire shares will prove to be a productive use of cash. To illustrate that point, under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we have retired more than 77 million shares, representing more than 12% of our current shares outstanding at an average price of less than $69.
As Brian mentioned, our after-tax return on invested capital, or ROIC, was a very healthy 13% for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter. This is nearly 2 percentage points higher than last year when our business results were under pressure following the data breach. Given our plan to generate profitable growth on a relatively stable base of invested capital, we expect to continue to grow this metric over time with a goal of -- to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter and what that guidance implies for our expected full year performance. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we're mindful that the consumer remains cautious and there are indications of heavy inventory levels at some competitors. However, we remain focused on the things we can control and what has been working all year. These include our ability to deliver on our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise by offering great products at a compelling value, iconic marketing that guests love and an outstanding store experience that differentiates Target from everyone else. With that context, we expect to deliver a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, consistent with our third quarter guidance. Underlying that guidance, we expect digital growth of about 20%, consistent with our third quarter performance. 
Before I move down -- further down the Q4 P&L, I want to pause and discuss a challenge we hear a lot, which is based on the acceleration in 2-year stack performance we're planning for the fourth quarter. John answered this question last call, but I think it's worth addressing in more detail today. 
Last year, our fourth quarter comparable sales growth was 3.8%, but that was on top of a 2.5% sales decline in the fourth quarter 2013 when we announced the data breach on the weekend before Christmas. So while the announces of multiyear sales performance isn't always useful, I think in this case, it's important to think about a 3-year stack of our comp sales. Specifically, if we hit the midpoint of our fourth quarter sales guidance, the simple 3-year stack would be a 2.8% comp, slightly less than the 3% 3-year stack we've delivered year-to-date. So while there are always risks to every sales forecast, we don't believe the 2-year stack provides useful insight in this case. 
Moving back to the P&L. We expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate to be flat to down slightly from last year's 9.8% rate. Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect a moderate gross margin rate decline to be offset by a similar improvement in our SG&A expense rate this quarter. 
We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be consistent with our third quarter, and our tax rate is expectedly -- is expected to be approximately 34% as we annualized over last year's favorable resolution of tax matters. 
With our current cash position and expected business results, we plan to continue repurchasing our shares this quarter, and we will continue to manage the magnitude and pace of repurchase activity with the goal of maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. 
Altogether, this performance would lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.48 to $1.58 compared with $1.49 in fourth quarter 2014. 
Let's look at what this guidance implies for our expectations for full year 2015 financial performance, which I'll compare to the guidance we provided at our financial community meeting last March. At that meeting, we laid out an expectation for 2015 comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Given our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect our full year comp to remain firmly in that range. 
I would note that the channel mix of our sales has been different than expectations, specifically with year-to-date digital sales growth of 29% and our expected 20% growth in the fourth quarter. It's clear that in 2015, we don't expect to attain the longer-term 40% goal we laid out in March. However, we've delivered on our overall comparable sales goal every quarter this year, and we still expect to deliver industry-leading digital sales growth, both important benchmarks for us. 
In March, we laid out an expectation to grow our segment EBITDA margin rate by 20 to 30 basis points for the year, and we are on track to outperform that expectation with growth closer to 40 to 50 basis points in 2015. 
Regarding capital deployment, we are on track to meet our guidance for 5% to 10% dividend growth this year, and we've already met our goal for $2 billion or more in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of the year. 
And finally, we told you in March that we expected to generate $4.45 to $4.65 in adjusted EPS for the year. And despite a challenging backdrop, with our updated guidance today, we are positioned to deliver performance at the high end of or above that range for the year. 
Beyond my love for the brand, I was attracted to Target because of our singular focus on delighting our guests and our tremendous desire to win. It's evident across our stores, online team, distribution centers and headquarters. 
I recently visited one of our stores and have the opportunity to meet Bev, who has been with the company for an amazing 44 years. In her current role, Bev is involved in the ship-from-store process, and she says their whole team loves this new capability because it allows our stores to drive sales by serving guests in new ways. 
Now that I've been immersed in our business for the past 3 months, I'm mindful of the opportunity ahead of us and the work we still need to do to accomplish, but I'm encouraged by the progress we've seen already. Traffic has increased for the full year. Signature categories are leading our sales every quarter. And with a renewed focus on Retail fundamentals and the dedication of team members like Bev, we are delivering on our vision to provide shopping on demand while maintaining our focus on everyday in-stock reliability across our store network. 
The ultimate measure of this year's accomplishments can be seen in our earnings. We've delivered a 16.9% increase in our adjusted earnings per share so far this year. And with our fourth quarter guidance, we were well positioned to deliver double-digit growth for the year. We're excited about this initial progress, and we remain laser-focused on building on this momentum over time. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

And while we haven't made major changes with fixtures and in-store decor, we've been very focused on assortment changes and bringing more natural, organic, local items into many of our categories, and we're seeing the guests react very favorably. So to me, it's getting the basics right. And before we start making fixture changes and decor changes, it has to start with the right assortment and making sure we have the items, the brands our guest is looking for when they shop food at Target. So the acceleration you're seeing right now is driven by section by section, getting the assortment right, bringing more appealing items to our guests, adding more natural, organic, gluten-free items that are on trend to those categories. We made some significant changes in yogurt in the third quarter and saw very, very positive responses, high single-digit growth rates in those categories. So while we're not shouting about it, we're making steady progress in Food. We'll learn a lot more in 25 stores in Los Angeles, where you will see some changes in fixtures and decor.

As we step back and look at our third quarter results and our year-to-date performance, it's clear that our strategy is working and we're delivering on the financial commitments we laid out last March. Following",2331,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we step back and look at our third quarter results and our year-to-date performance, it's clear that our strategy is working and we're delivering on the financial commitments we laid out last March. 
Following an extended period of declines, traffic has turned positive over the last 4 quarters and has been accelerating on a 2-year basis. Sales in signature categories have been growing much faster than our overall sales, and they are clearly exceeding industry benchmarks. So while consumers continue to spend cautiously, we feel confident as we enter the holiday season, and we're focused on continuing to deliver on both our strategic priorities and our financial goals. 
As we mentioned in our last conference call, our third quarter plans were based on the knowledge that we were facing stronger prior-year comparisons than we had experienced earlier in the year. Now with the quarter behind us, I'm pleased to report that not only did we meet our forecast, we saw continued progress on our strategy. 
Specifically, 2-year growth trends in comp sales, traffic and signature category performances each accelerated in the third quarter, following strong performance in the second quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.86 was 8.6% higher than last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. 
Third quarter comparable sales were up 1.9%, also near the high end of our guidance and driven primarily by growth in traffic. We're really pleased that our guests are responding to the investments we're making in our assortment, presentation and shopping experience, and we're focused on building on this year's traffic increases in both stores and our digital platforms in the quarters and years ahead. 
Our third quarter gross margin rate was down slightly to last year, reflecting the benefits of a favorable merchandising mix and the comparison over last year's intense promotional markdowns. These benefits were offset by reimbursement pressure in pharmacy, combined with the impact of investments in quality and innovation on our owned and exclusive brands. 
Third quarter SG&A expenses were solid and in line with our expectation, as Cathy will cover in a few minutes. We reported a very healthy after-tax return on invested capital of 13% this quarter, nearly 2 percentage points higher than a year ago as progress on our strategic priorities has driven improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital. 
Given this favorable performance, we continue to have capacity to invest in our business while returning a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders. This quarter, we will return well over $1 billion through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to well over $3 billion so far this year. 
Consistent with our guidance, our third quarter comp sales increase was somewhat smaller than in the second quarter. From a category perspective, the entire change of pace in sales was attributable to Apparel and Electronics. 
In Apparel, third quarter comp sales grew just under 3% compared with nearly 5% in the second quarter. This slowdown was correlated with warm weather in September, followed by a reacceleration when somewhat cooler temperatures arrived in October. 
In the Electronics category, we saw a double-digit decline in the third quarter comp sales. This performance reflects the comparison over last year's most intense electronic promotions, which occurred in August, and the continued softness in tablets, consistent with industry trends. One standout in Electronics was wearable devices, part of the signature Wellness category, where we saw nearly 100% growth in comparable sales. Another standout was our Toy category, part of the signature kids business, which matched its second quarter growth with another 12% comp sales increase this quarter. Beyond strength in licensed products, growth in Toys was broad based across multiple subcategories, including small dolls, LEGO, action toys and board games. 
We were also pleased with third quarter results from Seasonal programs, beginning with solid performance in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, all the way through Halloween, when we saw very strong increases in costumes and decor and solid growth in Candy. 
And to show you why we're so excited about the upcoming Star Wars release, we had the #1 market share in Star Wars when we launched our assortment back in September. 
Looking through the lens of our category roles, third quarter comp sales growth was led by signature categories, which grew more than 2.5x as fast as our overall sales. And as I mentioned, given the tougher prior-year comparisons, our 2-year stack comps in signature categories were stronger in the third quarter than either of the first 2 quarters of this year. 
Beyond toys and wearable Electronics, our third quarter standouts within signature included Baby and Kids Apparel, women's ready-to-wear and Wellness items in Food. 
In Food overall, for the first time this year, third quarter comp sales growth outpaced comp sales overall as our work to reinvigorate this category is beginning to shape our performance. In key categories like yogurt, where we added premium and better-for-you brands, we saw a high single digit comp sales increase in the third quarter. We saw similar comp increases in craft beer and wine, reflecting our work to enhance the assortment and bring locally relevant brands to our guests. Looking forward, we'll continue to enhance our Food assortment with a focus on Wellness, local relevance and seasonally appropriate items. And following the holiday season, we'll begin testing changes to Food shopping environments in a set of 25 remodels scheduled for the L.A. market, along with a set of SuperTarget remodels scheduled for next year. 
Digital sales increased 20% in the third quarter, contributing about 40 basis points to our comp sales increase. While significantly outpacing the industry, this performance was well below our expectation of 30% growth when we -- which we outlined in the last call. 
As we look at the drivers of this performance, it's clear the third quarter softness in Electronics was particularly impactful online. And like our stores, digital sales growth in Apparel was slower during much of the quarter, correlating with the relatively warm weather across much of the country. We know that our digital investments drive engagement and sales in all of our channels, and we're pleased that our third quarter sales were at the high end of our expectation. However, we believe we have an opportunity to accelerate digital transactions by enhancing the experience on target.com. 
Beyond our efforts to streamline the guest experience on our site, our team is rolling out multiple initiatives that we expect to drive digital traffic and sales over time. And once again, this holiday season, we expect to be offering free shipping on all digital orders. We were very pleased with the guest response to this offer a year ago, and we expect it to be a key differentiator for Target again this holiday season. Regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled, in a store or on a guest's front porch, we know the vast majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled. For example, our guests access our brands through a digital device both in advance of and during their trip to one of our stores. As a result, we don't think of digital as simply a selling channel, but a critical enabler for the shopping experience in all of our channels. This has significant strategic implications, both in terms of organizational structure and the way we reward our team. 
Since I arrived last year, we have been evolving our approach to focus first on our core guests and build a total Target assortment that best serves the needs and expectations of our guests. Only after we've determined the appropriate assortment do we plan on how to offer to each of our selling channels. 
Consider our efforts in signature categories. For more than a year now, we've been investing in these categories with the expectation that they will grow most rapidly, and we've seen this play out in all of our channels. In fact, even while our digital footprint remains relatively small, we're approaching $1 billion of annual sales in our Home category, making us one of the leading digital retailers in the space. 
As we look ahead to the holidays, we are excited about our merchandising and marketing plans, and we believe we'll further differentiate Target during a critical retail season. 
In Hardlines, toys has already turned in a terrific performance so far this year, and we expect this strength to continue throughout the fourth quarter when we typically generate half of our annual toy sales. This year, more than 15% of our toy assortment is exclusive to Target, including the exclusive BB-8 Droid from the upcoming Star Wars movie, which we expect to be a top seller. 
We're also bringing back our kid's Wish List app this year, with enhanced features to make it easy and fun for family and friends to shop for the perfect gift for every kid in their life. Our gift catalog featuring more than 700 items was distributed to 40 million guests this year through direct mail, newspaper and distribution in our stores. 
On Cartwheel, we are seeing great results from our daily toy deal, which is featuring a different toy at 50% off every day through December 24. And finally, we're bringing everything together on our kid's gifting hub on target.com, which is designed to make shopping easy for parents and gift givers while creating a destination that's fun and inspirational for kids. 
In Electronics, we're excited to be one of the few retailers offering the Apple Watch in stores this season, and we expect this item to be a top gift item in wearable categories. Also in wearables, we partnered with UNICEF to offer their Kid Power Band, which encourages kids to get more active and, based on the points they accumulate, improve the lives of kids around the world. 
We also expect Drone to be a big hit this season. So we're featuring nearly 20 in-store and about 4x as many online. 
We're planning for a big season in video games, a key gifting category where hardware prices continue to moderate and software libraries continue to grow. And in Entertainment, where we're very excited to be featuring a Target-exclusive version of Adele's new 25 release that features 3 bonus tracks available only at Target. 
As we enter the holiday season, about 1,400 of our stores are featuring mannequins in Apparel, which is about double the number we had a year ago. Also this year, we've enhanced the shopping experience by updating presentations in Home and Electronics in more than 200 additional stores for each group. So we feel great about the ability of our stores to showcase our assortment. 
And this year, when our guests shop at Target for the holidays, they'll find an assortment focused on 3 key things: entertaining, decorating and gifting. To support each of these themes, we've invested in quality and differentiation, featuring real marble, hand-carved wood, copper accents and genuine leather. In fact, more than 20% of our holiday gifting items are handcrafted this year. 
In Food, we're highlighting exclusive brands and flavors, including Republic of Wine, our new exclusive brand, which features unique discoveries from around the world. We're rolling out classic holiday and harvest flavors in Archer Farms, and we're offering exclusive indulgent seasonal flavors from great national brand partners with M&M's, Hershey's, Dove and Ghirardelli. 
And finally, anticipation's building for Black Friday, which is just over a week away. Once again, this year, we're opening our stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, and our team is already preparing to deliver a combination of great deals and a shopping experience that makes Target different from everyone else. 
But we're committed to offering compelling savings value beyond the traditional Black Friday event. Beginning this Sunday, we'll launch 10 days of deals on Electronics, Kitchenware, Toys and more, which will run through Tuesday, December 1. 
This Sunday's weekly ad will also reveal special deals from our Black Friday presale, which takes place on Wednesday, November 25. For our guests who prefer to shop digitally, all of our Black Friday deals will be offered on target.com. And finally, guests who spend $70 -- $75 or more on Friday, November 27, will receive a voucher for 20% off on future purchases, redeemable from December 4 through the 13th. 
Last March, in our meeting with the financial community, we outlined our plan to grow profitably by focusing on a set of key enterprise priorities. And while we have much more work to do, we remain committed to that plan and are pleased with our progress so far. 
Through the first 3 quarters of 2015, we've successfully grown traffic, sales and profits a bit faster than we originally expected by focusing on our core guests and providing them with differentiated assortments and the experience they expect and deserve. But we're not slowing down because we see enormous opportunity still ahead of us. We're going to continue to focus on elevating the assortment, quality and the presentation in our signature categories. 
Across every category, we'll differentiate Target's assortment by providing exclusive items from both our national branded partners and one-of-a-kind items from our outstanding product design and development team. And while we're encouraged with the recent acceleration in Food sales, we are still in the very early stages of our work to provide a unique assortment of fresh, local and healthy items to our guests. 
And finally, while I'm pleased we've already made early progress in our efforts to improve our in-stock performance, I believe we've got a multiyear opportunity to improve our reliability, both in stores and in digital channels, by modernizing the way we work and refocusing on retail fundamentals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to John Mulligan, who will discuss his team's early efforts to improve operations as well as John's priorities going forward. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our initial efforts to reinforce our retail fundamentals, particularly our in-stock position, and I'll cover our priorities and progress in our work to modernize the supply chain in support of our strategic initiatives. 
The good news is that while we have lots of work still ahead of us, we have seen meaningful improvement in key in-stock measures based on changes we've made in the last few months. While we strive to be in stock on every item in every store throughout every day, we know that need-based commodity categories are the most critical. If our guests don't believe that they can rely on Target to have their shopping list items available every time they shop, they'll begin to skip some trips to Target even though they enjoy shopping our more discretionary categories. 
As a result, when in-stock metrics on our core commodity categories began deteriorating this year, we created an out-of-stock action team to conduct deep dives by category to identify both short-term and long-term solutions. When a team identifies solutions within a category, we can quickly test them to confirm they improve our performance and then determine if those solutions can be applied more broadly. 
This team focused first on our Household, Personal, Baby category and more recently, they've done work on our center store Grocery category. In a short amount of time, they have identified opportunities related to the way we generate vendor orders, optimize tradeoffs between order quantities and frequency and our reliance on system-generated solutions versus manual processes. 
In high-volume stores, the team has implemented adjustments to planograms to enhance holding capacity on fast-turning SKUs, reducing the need for frequent store replenishment. And in our distribution centers, the team has identified opportunities to reduce lead-time variability, tighten delivery windows and, in some cases, increase safety stock on key items. 
I should note that this increase in safety stock is one of the drivers of the 4% inventory growth we reported at the end of the quarter. In a very short time, the results of our efforts have been encouraging. In Household, Personal, Baby, we've been able to reduce overall out-of-stock measures by approximately 50% in about 8 weeks. In center store Grocery, in less than a month, the team was able to reduce out-of-stock measures by about 25% and importantly, we've been able to reduce out of stock even further on the items most important to our guests. 
Given these encouraging initial results, the team is moving quickly to scale these solutions to a broader set of categories throughout the store and conducting additional deep dives in categories like Health & Beauty. Looking ahead, the team has a number of key priorities, including work to optimize case packs, which will better accommodate variability in store sales volumes across our network. 
In addition, they are implementing technology and process improvement to improve count integrity throughout our stores and distribution network. Included in these efforts will be a test of RFID technology in a few of our Apparel categories to gauge the effectiveness of the technology relative to the cost of implementation. This work is being supported by the rollout of an agile technology development in partnership with Mike McNamara, our new Chief Information Officer, and our newly hired Senior Vice President of Operational Excellence, Anu Gupta. We are very excited to have Anu on the team. She has more than 20 years of relevant experience in driving operational excellence by leveraging best practices in a variety of operating models, including procurement and Lean Six Sigma process redesign across a range of industries, including retail. We're confident Anu will accelerate the efforts of the outstanding team we already have in place. 
Beyond our work to improve reliability, our store teams are working diligently to support Target's efforts to become more flexible in the way we fulfill guest demand. As a result of last year's rollout of ship-from-store capability, stores have already shipped more than 10 million items directly to guests so far this year, and the percent of digital orders delivered in a 3-day window has more than doubled compared with a year ago. To showcase this improvement in our capabilities, last quarter, we rolled out new functionality we call available to promise, which offers guests a more precise shipping window. With available to promise, we expect nearly 2/3 of our digital orders will offer a guest a delivery window of 3 business days or fewer compared with our typical window of 4 to 7 business days prior to the rollout. We recently expanded our ship-from-store capability to more than 300 additional stores, bringing the total to more than 1/4 of the chain. This will enable about 40% of digital transactions to be shipped from our stores in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, 2 new direct-to-guest fulfillment centers became operational in the third quarter, in advance of the holiday season. With the expanded capacity these changes provide, we expect to continue making progress on shipping speed next year. 
As Brian mentioned, most of our store sales are digitally enabled, so we continue to integrate digital experiences into the stores. Guests increasingly use Cartwheel, our digital savings app with more than 20 million authenticated users, to plan their store trips in advance and then use the app to search for additional deals while shopping in store. 
In addition, because 10% to 15% of our digital orders are picked up in stores, we are exploring ways to streamline the pickup process by expanding holding capacity at the service counter and implementing process improvements to reduce wait times. For next year's L.A. 25 remodels, we will feature all of our latest merchandising enhancements. We will test changes to the front end that will make pick -- make order pickup even more convenient, including dedicated ambassadors to help store guests better understand Target's digital capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I want to thank our store and distribution center teams for their great performance so far this year and for their current efforts to ensure we provide an outstanding guest experience this holiday season. It's an enormous challenge for both our stores and distribution teams to accommodate the surge in volumes we see at Black Friday. 
But our store teams don't focus only on moving merchandise. They focus first on our guests and do an amazing amount of preparation to ensure guests have a pleasant and safe experience. It's one of the many things that makes Target unique and one of the reasons why guests love our stores and our brand. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,310466888,905967,"Target Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are pleased that this quarter's performance was near the high end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS.

As Brian mentioned earlier, we are pleased that this quarter's performance was near the high end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS. As is often the case, when you get into the detailed P&L, there were some ins and outs within the quarter that generally offset each other, which I'll cover in a few minutes. 
This quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.86, above the midpoint of our guidance range and 8.6% above last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.76, $0.10 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.05 of asset impairment, $0.03 of data breach expense and $0.02 related to the corporate restructuring we announced last spring. 
Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.87 compared with the $0.55 a year ago, as this year we recognized $0.11 of tax benefit related to our investment losses in Canada, while last year we incurred $0.27 of after-tax losses related to Canadian operations. 
Let's turn to third quarter segment results. Among the drivers of our 1.9% comparable sales growth, we are pleased that traffic grew a very healthy 1.4% in the third quarter. This growth is even more encouraging when we look at performance on a 2-year basis, as we faced a tougher comparison in the third quarter than either of the first 2 quarters of the year. 
October marked our 12th straight month of traffic growth, and we are laser-focused on this metric as a key indicator of the health of our business over time. Breaking out our sales growth between stores and our digital platforms, the stores accounted for a little over 3/4 of our comparable sales growth, while digital contributed about 40 basis points to our third quarter comp. Consistent with results from earlier in the year, our digital growth continues to be driven by a meaningful improvement in conversion. And although we have seen an acceleration in the last 2 months, we haven't seen the growth in digital traffic we expected to see this year. We believe our biggest opportunity to drive traffic continues to be our work to streamline and enhance the digital experience. 
Third quarter REDcard penetration was 22.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago, and we remain on track to meet our guidance for an increase of 100 basis points or more for the full year. As you'll recall, we tested REDcard Rewards in the Kansas City market for a year before we launched the program nationwide. With the benefit of that head start, penetration in Kansas City continues to run well ahead of the rest of the country, giving us confidence that we have continued room to grow this rewards program in the years ahead. 
In addition, we are optimistic that the industry's move to EMV or chip-and-pin technology will help restore confidence in the U.S. payment system and increase the willingness of consumers to add new cards to their wallet. Regarding our move to EMV, we are pleased to be one of only a few large retailers in the United States that are accepting chip cards for both credit and debit transactions in advance of this holiday season. 
We've already reissued chip cards to about half of our Target-branded debit and credit card holders, and we expect to complete the rollout early next year, following a pause for the holiday season. 
Our third quarter segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were both about 20 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our guidance as strong SG&A performance offset the impact of a lower-than-expected gross margin rate. 
On the gross margin line, third quarter performance was about 10 basis points below last year, short of our expectations. While we continue to benefit from the comparison to last year's promotions, the benefit is waning as the intensity of those promotions began to taper in the third quarter of last year. 
In addition, consistent with results from earlier in the year, we're seeing continued margin pressure from quality investments in our owned and exclusive brands. Finally, this quarter, we saw reimbursement pressure in our pharmacy business, which we expect to continue until we complete the sale of this business to CVS. 
I want to pause for a moment and comment on the CVS transaction. We continue to work closely with the CVS team to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction. And while we don't have an update on the potential timing for the transaction to close, we are pleased with our progress to date. 
Turning back to the third quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we saw unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter, about 30 basis points lower than last year. As part of our efforts to control costs, this quarter's expense rate benefited from the discontinuation of an outdated little-used retiree medical plan, but we also saw discipline across the organization, which drove outstanding underlying performance. 
Even on the marketing line, where some expenses were retimed into the third quarter from the second quarter last year, we recognized savings in other programs that led to overall favorability compared with last year. 
As John mentioned and consistent with last quarter, our inventory position at the end of the third quarter was about 4% above last year. This reflects a significant improvement from the higher year-over-year increases we were seeing earlier this year. And while inventory growth is slightly higher than our pace of sales, it reflects changes in receipt timing compared with last year, combined with the intentional investments we're making in commodity categories to improve our in-stock position. As a result, we feel very good about our inventory position going into the holiday season in relation to both our sales plan and our work to improve in-stock reliability. 
Turning back to consolidated metrics. Third quarter interest expense was $151 million, $5 million higher than last year. Our third quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 34.3%, up from 30.6% last year, when we recognized a $30 million benefit from the resolution of tax matters. 
We paid third quarter dividends of $352 million, up about 7% from last year. And given our cash position and continued strong business results, we had the opportunity to invest another $942 million in share repurchase this quarter. Given our long-range plan to generate profitable growth, we believe the continued opportunity to retire shares will prove to be a productive use of cash. To illustrate that point, under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we have retired more than 77 million shares, representing more than 12% of our current shares outstanding at an average price of less than $69.
As Brian mentioned, our after-tax return on invested capital, or ROIC, was a very healthy 13% for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter. This is nearly 2 percentage points higher than last year, when our business results were under pressure following the data breach. Given our plan to generate profitable growth on a relatively stable base of invested capital, we expect to continue to grow this metric over time with a goal of -- to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter and what that guidance implies for our expected full year performance. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we're mindful that the consumer remains cautious and there are indications of heavy inventory levels at some competitors. However, we remain focused on the things we can control and what has been working all year. These include our ability to deliver on our ""Expect More. Pay Less."" brand promise by offering great products at a compelling value, iconic marketing that guests love and an outstanding store experience that differentiates Target from everyone else. With that context, we expect to deliver a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, consistent with our third quarter guidance. Underlying that guidance, we expect digital growth of about 20%, consistent with our third quarter performance. 
Before I move down -- further down the Q4 P&L, I want to pause and discuss a challenge we hear a lot, which is based on the acceleration in 2-year stacked performance we're planning for the fourth quarter. John answered this question last call, but I think it's worth addressing in more detail today. 
Last year, our fourth quarter comparable sales growth was 3.8%, but that was on top of a 2.5% sales decline in the fourth quarter 2013, when we announced the data breach on the weekend before Christmas. So while the analysis of multiyear sales performance isn't always useful, I think in this case, it's important to think about a 3-year stack of our comp sales. Specifically, if we hit the midpoint of our fourth quarter sales guidance, the simple 3-year stack would be a 2.8% comp, slightly less than the 3% 3-year stack we've delivered year-to-date. So while there are always risks to every sales forecast, we don't believe the 2-year stack provides useful insight in this case. 
Moving back to the P&L. We expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate to be flat to down slightly from last year's 9.8% rate. Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect a moderate gross margin rate decline to be offset by a similar improvement in our SG&A expense rate this quarter. 
We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be consistent with our third quarter, and our tax rate is expectedly -- is expected to be approximately 34% as we annualized over last year's favorable resolution of tax matters. 
With our current cash position and expected business results, we plan to continue repurchasing our shares this quarter, and we will continue to manage the magnitude and pace of repurchase activity with the goal of maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. 
Altogether, this performance would lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.48 to $1.58 compared with $1.49 in fourth quarter 2014. 
Let's look at what this guidance implies for our expectations for full year 2015 financial performance, which I'll compare to the guidance we provided at our financial community meeting last March. At that meeting, we laid out an expectation for 2015 comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Given our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect our full year comp to remain firmly in that range. 
I would note that the channel mix of our sales has been different than expectations. Specifically, with year-to-date digital sales growth of 29% and our expected 20% growth in the fourth quarter, it's clear that in 2015, we don't expect to attain the longer-term 40% goal we laid out in March. However, we've delivered on our overall comparable sales goal every quarter this year, and we still expect to deliver industry-leading digital sales growth, both important benchmarks for us. 
In March, we laid out an expectation to grow our segment EBITDA margin rate by 20 to 30 basis points for the year, and we are on track to outperform that expectation with growth closer to 40 to 50 basis points in 2015. 
Regarding capital deployment, we are on track to meet our guidance for 5% to 10% dividend growth this year, and we've already met our goal for $2 billion or more in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of the year. 
And finally, we told you in March that we expected to generate $4.45 to $4.65 in adjusted EPS for the year. And despite a challenging backdrop, with our updated guidance today, we are positioned to deliver performance at the high end of or above that range for the year. 
Beyond my love for the brand, I was attracted to Target because of our singular focus on delighting our guests and our tremendous desire to win. It's evident across our stores, online team, distribution centers and headquarters. 
I recently visited one of our stores and had the opportunity to meet Bev, who has been with the company for an amazing 44 years. In her current role, Bev is involved in the ship-from-store process, and she says their whole team loves this new capability because it allows our stores to drive sales by serving guests in new ways. 
Now that I've been immersed in our business for the past 3 months, I'm mindful of the opportunity ahead of us and the work we still need to do to accomplish, but I'm encouraged by the progress we've seen already. Traffic has increased for the full year. Signature categories are leading our sales every quarter. And with a renewed focus on retail fundamentals and the dedication of team members like Bev, we are delivering on our vision to provide shopping on demand while maintaining our focus on everyday in-stock reliability across our store network. 
The ultimate measure of this year's accomplishments can be seen in our earnings. We've delivered a 16.9% increase in our adjusted earnings per share so far this year. And with our fourth quarter guidance, we're well positioned to deliver double-digit growth for the year. We're excited about this initial progress, and we remain laser-focused on building on this momentum over time. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

And just in the last 24 months -- or 24 hours, we saw the October e-commerce growth rates in the U.S., and it was up about 8.6%. The outlook that NRF has for e-commerce growth in the fourth quarter is somewhere between 6% and 8%. So while our 20% growth rate is not in line with our expectations, it's still dramatically outperforming the industry. And I think the most important measure we're looking at is the fact that over 80% of our guests start their shopping journey online, either at home on their desktop or with a mobile device, and that digitally influenced guest is coming into our stores more often. So as we've talked about our strategy, our strategy is to make sure we allow our guest to shop anywhere, anytime they want with Target. And what we're seeing right now is they're voting with their feet to spend more time in our stores. They're downloading our Cartwheel app, and 20 million downloads so far to date. So I think we're seeing an overall slowdown in digital growth across retail, and we're really pleased that we continue to outpace the industry -- dramatically outpace the industry, but our digital efforts are driving more traffic into our stores and helping us grow our overall comps. So while there's been a slowdown broadly across the sector, we continue to outpace the industry, and that's our fundamental goal."

And while 3% in Q3 was slightly less than the growth rate we saw in the second quarter, compared to many of our peers, we recognize that we're continuing to build traffic and growth in an important Apparel category. So the work we've done with mannequins, with changing the in-store experience is clearly paying off. One of the changes that we have announced recently is the addition of 1,400 visual merchandisers to make sure we combine the change in the ranking with mannequins and fixtures and layouts with experts in store that can maintain that great in-store merchandising experience. So that's a new venture for us. We're standing it up for the holidays. We expect that they continue to strengthen the in-store experience. And we know with our signature categories, we're still at the very, very early stages of standing up our Wellness position. But we feel like we're in an excellent position with Baby and Kids. We feel very good about our performance in the third quarter with Kids Apparel. Certainly, Toys has been a highlight throughout the year, and we feel as if we're well positioned coming off of second and third quarter comps in Toys that were up 12%, the reaction we've seen from the guest to our store -- Star Wars assortment, where we captured an industry-leading position and expect to be a destination during the holidays.

And while we haven't made major changes with fixtures and in-store decor, we've been very focused on assortment changes and bringing more natural, organic, local items into many of our categories, and we're seeing the guests react very favorably. So to me, it's getting the basics right. And before we start making fixture changes and decor changes, it has to start with the right assortment and making sure we have the items, the brands our guest is looking for when they shop food at Target. So the acceleration you're seeing right now is driven by, section by section, getting the assortment right, bringing more appealing items to our guests, adding more natural, organic, gluten-free items that are on trend to those categories. We made some significant changes in yogurt in the third quarter and saw very, very positive responses, high single-digit growth rates in those categories. So while we're not shouting about it, we're making steady progress in Food. We'll learn a lot more in 25 stores in Los Angeles, where you will see some changes in fixtures and decor.

We're running a little bit ahead of that pace and both in the cost of goods and in the SG&A space, both are running perhaps a little bit ahead of what we envisioned going into the year. So we feel really good about that. I think stepping back and kind of tying this back to Scott's question, the other thing we said at the time was we're taking $2 billion out of the P&L, but we didn't expect EBITDA margin expansion. And our view was that we would need this to fuel the investments, exactly some of the expense investments that perhaps Scott was referring to, and this would provide the capacity to do that, and that is, in fact, what we've seen. We've seen great expense discipline across the corporation, but where we needed to invest, we have had the capacity to do that."
