Now turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15, and finally, Benno will wrap up our prepared remarks as well as open it up for Q&A. 
Consistent with today's press release, all of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. 
Turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume was up 4%, and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies with the largest impact coming from Argentina. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 6%. Our growth reflects higher volume as well as a nearly 2-point benefit from price increases. 
Importantly, our sales results reflect strong performance across all U.S. segments and International on a currency-neutral basis. In Q2, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased 0.1 points versus the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in the quarter reflected continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. 
Inversely, we saw market share improvements in our Laundry business with Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Remover & Color Booster at 2 year highs. 
The Home Care category also continues to strengthen. For 8 consecutive months, we've grown market share on this business with strong second quarter gains and Clorox Disinfecting Wipes leading the way. 
Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter with very strong gains in face and lip care. Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up just over 1 point in the second quarter, a nice improvement following the 0.5 point gain we saw in Q1. 
We're continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority. 
With that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume and sales each increased 3% behind strong results in our Professional Products and Home Care businesses. Our Professional Products business delivered 21% volume growth and 19% sales growth behind double-digit shipment gains in Professional Cleaning and Healthcare along with a solid gain in food volume. 
While concerns about Ebola and entera virus had limited impact on our Retail business, which I will discuss in a moment, health care institutions did respond with significant purchases of Cleaning and disinfecting products contributing to top line growth for the quarter. 
Following such strong sales in Q2, we anticipate some slowdown in Professional Products in Q3 as these concerns have now abated. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased behind strong execution on several merchandising events along with distribution gains for our toilet cleaners. This solid volume and sales growth more than offset a distribution loss on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer last calendar year, a loss that we've now anniversary-ed beginning this month. 
In the near term, we don't anticipate getting distribution back at this customer. For perspective, our focus is on profitable growth for Clorox and category health, not growth at any cost. We believe we have the right strategy in place to drive our business and category growth in a profitable manner. In particular, we continue to believe there is opportunity for an increased Household penetration in the Wipes category, particularly as we launch meaningful innovation. 
For example, we recently launched several new products, including a wipe with micro scrubbers. It is consumer preferred versus those currently in market as well as new Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes that allow consumers to dust an entire room with one extra large wipe that picks up dust, hair and allergens such as pet dander. 
Importantly, as part of our strategy to expand Wipes usage around the home, we also introduced Clorox scrub singles kitchen pads, which come preloaded with Clorox cleaner and are meant to be tossed after use, thereby eliminating the most germ-laden items in households, the reusable sponge. There's a version of scrub singles for use in bathrooms as well. 
As we shared with you before, Clorox remains the clear leader in the Wipes category with market shares near 50% in tracked channels, more than twice that of the nearest branded player, and share trends have continued to improve. Early in the quarter, we did see an uptick in Wipes shipments heading into the cold-and-flu season behind consumer concerns regarding Ebola, but heightened consumer demand moderated quickly as reported cases dwindled. With the flu season just now getting into full swing, we'll be monitoring consumption and using regional flu data to work with retailers to help target disinfecting Wipes shipments where they're needed most. 
In our Laundry business, sales declined due to decreased Clorox Bleach volume as a result of category softness compared to strong category growth in the prior year. From a marketing standpoint, our investment in this brand and focus on value are paying off as December marked the fourth consecutive quarter of our market share growth on Clorox Bleach. 
Looking ahead, due to increases for input costs for our Bleach business, we're in the process of implementing a 7% average price increase effective February 1. 
In our Household segment, we delivered 3% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Glad and Cat Litter businesses. Our Bags and Wraps business grew volume 3%, driven by innovation behind the Hawaiian aloha scent as well as new scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Sales on Glad were up double digits behind price increases taken in 2014. 
Even in the face of intense competition, Cat Litter volume and sales increased behind distribution growth of our new Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight product. We continue to invest aggressively and innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control such as with our new eliminate odor for 10 days campaign that was launched in the second quarter. 
Keeping in mind that Q2 as a relatively small quarter for our Charcoal business, sales and volume declined following double-digit growth in the first quarter as retailers transitioned to our new and improved Kingsford Charcoal product that launched in January in advance of the 2015 grilling season. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew a strong 5% and sales increased 4%. These results were driven by very strong double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new Lip Crayons and new Vanilla Bean and Wild Cherry lip balm flavors grew strongly in the quarter, supported by our first-ever Burt's Bees television advertising. Our facial towelette business and skin brightening products were also very strong in the quarter. 
Turning to our Food business. Sales grew versus the year-ago quarter behind better volume in bottled and dry products. Finally, segment's positive results in Burt's Bees and Food were partially offset by lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products, primarily due to consumption declines on pour-through filters. 
As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. With our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will have a stronger second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to International. Volume is up 5% behind strong operating performance and volume growth in nearly all regions. However, sales declined 2% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
If you exclude the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. With oil and other commodity prices having fallen, capital investment in some countries has moderated, resulting in slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru. 
Strategically, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets and continue to take steps to overcome macroeconomic trends such as negative foreign currencies, high inflation and slowing GDP growth. In particular, we continue to carefully assess spending across our International division and implement price increases to mitigate the macro headwinds. 
Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015. As noted in this morning's earnings release, we've increased our sales growth outlook for the full year to be about 1%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength of the first half along with an updated outlook for the second half of the year. 
As I discussed, we anticipate some slowdown in Q3 in Professional Products following very strong Q2 shipments, in part related to Ebola and enterovirus concerns that have now greatly abated. In addition, we now anticipate stronger foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares as well as defend against reduced prices by competitors following the decline in input costs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2015."
89450,281091234,754594,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're pleased to have delivered a strong second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal '15, in addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. As y",877,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're pleased to have delivered a strong second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal '15, in addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. 
As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and earnings per share to reflect our solid first half results. In our second quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth and 2 points from pricing, partially offset by 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 6%. 
Our top line results came in better than expected, driven by strength in our Glad Professional Products and Burt's Bees businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, reflecting 130 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing, which were largely offset by 90 basis points of higher commodity cost as well as 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, reflecting continued inflationary pressures in International. 
And as we previously communicated, we continue to see significant cost pressures in the logistics and transportation market due to the tight supply of trucks and rail cars. 
Selling and administrative expense was lower in the second quarter at 14.2% of sales compared to 15% of sales in the year-ago quarter when the company made incremental investments to change IT service providers. Cost savings also contributed to lower selling and administrative expenses. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, reflecting continued strong support behind our brands, particularly to drive trial of new products. Notably, our U.S. Retail advertising spend was about 11% of sales. 
Our effective tax rate of 34.9% was almost 1 point lower versus year ago but in line with our full year projections. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97, an 8% increase versus the year-ago quarter. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $207 million compared with $159 million in the year-ago period. The increase was driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments, lower tax payments and the initial funding of the company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan last year. 
These factors were partially offset by $25 million in payments to settle interest rate hedges related to the company's issuance of long-term debt, the expense of which will be amortized over the 10-year life of the debt. In December of 2014, we issued $500 million senior notes, increasing the company's quarter-end cash balance with proceeds subsequently used to pay down a portion of the notes that matured on January 15 of this year. 
For fiscal '15, w continued to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook. As Steve mentioned, our fiscal year sales outlook now anticipates sales growth of about 1%, reflecting solid first half sales results, product innovation and the benefit of pricing. 
Our sales outlook also anticipates an even greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the range of 2% to 3%. In addition, fiscal year sales are anticipated to be impacted by slowing International economies as well as higher full year trade promotion spending as we continue to invest in our business and drive trial of new products. 
Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Given the significant decline in oil prices, we now anticipate lower resin prices in the second half, and commodity costs are expected to be about flat for the full year. For fiscal year 2015, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat as incremental demand-building investments are anticipated to offset gross margin expansion. 
We continue to anticipate our fiscal '15 tax rate to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.40 to $4.55. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the benefits from continuing commodity softness to be partially offset by continued increases in logistics costs. Also as we've done historically, we may use a portion of the resin-related savings to address potential competitive price cuts. We'll also closely track headwinds in International markets, including foreign currency declines and slowing economies. 
Now before I turn it over to Benno, I did want to let you know that moving forward, we will provide next year's fiscal year outlook starting with fiscal 2016 during our Q4 earnings call, which takes place in August. This change allows us to provide you with an outlook based on a full year of actuals and puts us more in line with the timing of our peer groups' outlook announcements. I'm happy to address any questions you might have on this process change, but I want to make you aware of this prior to the Q3 earnings release in May. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

It's great to be joining you on my first call as Clorox's CEO given the strong second quarter we just completed. This quarter's performance follows a very solid Q1, and it also speaks to the commitment to the 2020 Strategy and our focus on continuity with the leadership transition. 
That continuity of purpose is evident in our continued emphasis on category and overall market share improvement, profitably driving growth and stronger top line performance and creating shareholder value. Now clearly, as we head into the second half, we're facing a number of challenges, including continued softness in several categories, worsening foreign exchange headwinds and slowing economies in many International markets. 
I believe we've taken the right steps to support our brands with increased investments while driving margin improvement to grow profitably in this difficult environment. 
Now as I discussed with you on last quarter's call, the defining opportunity for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth. And looking ahead, we're leaning into 4 key elements of our 2020 Strategy that I believe drive the greatest value. These areas of emphasis, which we're calling strategy accelerators, will drive decisions around where we will invest more heavily, again with the intent to drive profitable growth. 
And I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce these to you today, and at an analyst meeting we plan on hosting later this year, we'll delve more deeply into how we're activating them. 
The first area of emphasis is accelerating portfolio momentum. In other words, leveraging tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and investing more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. 
The second is accelerating 3D technology transformation, which aims to addressing increasing consumer fragmentation, a shift in how today's consumer shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them to win the battle for the physical and virtual shopping cart. 
The third area of emphasis is accelerating innovation. Now this isn't just about product innovation. It's about innovation in sales and marketing as well as product supply, really anything that has to do with our demand-creation model built around the 3 Ds of desire, decide and delight. Innovation in all these areas drives category growth, and we're committed to driving more of that. 
Finally, we want to accelerate our growth culture while, at the same time, maintaining our traditional operational excellence. We want to dial up our strong Clorox culture to have an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I strongly believe these 4 areas of emphasis are what we need to drive growth while doing so profitably, and I look forward to sharing more about them with you over time. 
Now with that, let's open it up to your questions."

I'd like to remind you that we're pricing to a long-term cost advantage and not to a peak. And again, these are fully cost justified. We do have a strong track record in pricing. So over the last 10 years, 95% of our pricing increases have stuck. They're based on a very strong analytics as well, and we're in the process of talking to our retailers as we speak. So based on that strong track record and the cost justification, we are confident that this price increase will be successful. At the same time, we'll always monitor what'll happen in the marketplace, what'll happen with competition, and we're certainly also willing back to spend back if needed to defend the business."

We have, for the first time, launched a TV advertising campaign because we realized that the awareness behind the brand really has a lot of upside on the base business even though the brand has been around for 20 years, and that's been leading to really nice results on the base business. We are leaning into the investments behind the innovations more strongly, and we've really seen how lip but also face innovation has yielded really nice results last quarter. And finally, we're working with retailers to make sure we have the right in-store support out there. So really it is helping us understand where those tailwinds are, investing in those tailwinds behind the portfolio like Burt's Bees and like certain areas in Home Care and like Food enhancers and using that to drive growth, but growth the right way."

And if you think about what's happening here in the U.S., you see indications of an increasing consumer confidence. University of Michigan just issued their Consumer Sentiment Index, its highest since 2004 I believe. There's hope that there perhaps will be higher consumer spend due to lower oil prices. So those are good things. At the same time, Household formation is still lower than it historically has been. The jobs that are created are still paying less than the jobs that were lost during the recession, and there still is this bifurcation in society where the bottom half isn't really doing well. So there's put and takes. I would say we're cautiously optimistic. Our expectation right now is still based on flat to low single-digit category growth. And for us, we focus on what we can control, and that's investing in innovation. We have a strong innovation plan also going out in Q3 of this fiscal year that we're investing behind. And we talked to you in the past about increasing our demand spend by 1 point of net sales over time. That's called for by our strategy, and we're certainly leaning into that, a focus on delivering better value than competitors in private label.

And certainly, in Wipes, we have a very strong innovation program and focusing on pointing out to the consumer that we're delivering superior value. That's really working in the marketplace. That's what we'll be focused on, and that's not to say that we won't respond appropriately if we feel like there's very strong trade promotion going on in the category. We will defend our market shares, but I think we've always said that our focus is on earning market share, not buying market share. And in Wipes in particular, that's playing out quite nicely at this point. I would say the competitive dynamics in Home Care are strong as they always have been, but I wouldn't call them elevated at this point."

We're launching Glad with gain scent. The gain scent is one that's played well as a scent endorsement across various categories, and we feel like this is another opportunity for us to support our strategy of differentiating our trash bags and encouraging trade up by delivering something that's unique and very hard for our competitors to replicate. So in a nutshell, really strong merchandising, but in particular, very strong consumer acceptance in this premium trash segment behind our innovations.

Obviously, oil has moved down pretty significantly over the last 90 days. It's not clear how long it'll stay down at these levels. So I think as we start looking at our fiscal '16 planning, we'll have to take a hard look at how long will these prices really stay at today's levels. I think certainly for the next 6 months or so, we expect them to be depressed. Beyond that, I think it remains to be seen. A couple of other things I would point about the resin market. The supply-demand balance still remains fairly tight here in the U.S., and so resin prices have yet to come down. Actually, in the first half of our fiscal year, resin pricing was up. We do anticipate it'll go down in the second half, but that's mainly being driven by lower prices overseas, and that's creating some downward pressure here in the U.S. So it's good, but I would just temper expectations a bit to say it's not just energy prices, it's also the supply-demand balance. And then finally, as you think of resin, which is the largest commodity that we buy, keep in mind that historically, in this category, when you have seen a large move downward in resin pricing, more than half of that has been spent back in the category, and that's certainly what we're anticipating. So in short, it's always better to have a tailwind than a headwind, but I think at this point, we're cautiously optimistic on how that might play through in fiscal '16."

It will likely come down and help you guys out, but also help your competitors.

First of all, the price increases are cost justified. Let me just point out when you look at the total supply chain whether it's labor inflation, health care costs, transportation cost in particular or even all the other raw material sets, those have all been moving up. So we try to price, as Benno said, to the long-term average cost. So I think we feel both the bleach increases as well as Glad is a cost-justified price increase. Now as it relates to Glad, as you know, the resin market it actually tends to go up pretty quick and comes down slow has been the history. But there's been a long-standing issue where if prices to come down in the spot market for resin, sometimes you'll see a step up in merchandising activity. Well, that's certainly what we're planning for, and it's certainly baked into the outlook and our expectations. But I think we've done a long track record of managing the ups and downs of resin pricing with the Glad business quite successfully. So we've seen this story before. We managed the long-term cost, and I think we feel pretty cool about the decisions we've taken. And if conditions are different then we think we'll manage through it."

If you look at the 3 businesses that you referenced, Ali, that grew last quarter, 2 of them really have been growing strongly for a long time. And we've always pointed out those 2 businesses, Professional and Burt's Bees, as growth areas. And like I said, we're leaning into investments, and those investments are showing good returns. Glad, I mean, I probably wouldn't expect that growth rates that we've seen in the last quarter on Glad on a consistent basis going forward. But if I really look at underlying growth drivers, that's innovation. The businesses where we had strong innovation, they have grown. And as you know, we're very focused on growing our business behind innovation, and like I said, we have a very strong innovation program out there also for the fiscal year back half. So we're growing. We're growing the right way, and importantly, if you look across the segments, we're growing in all segments. So I feel good about how much we're focused on the core and which businesses are growing, and I certainly would expect Home Care also going forward to contribute more. As Steve said, we have just now a few days ago cycled through distribution loss with a major club customer so that the Wipes growth that we're seeing in tracked channels hopefully will be visible also in shipments as we compare them versus year ago. On International, I think what we said in International is what we do want to do is grow more profitably. We're expecting a 5% to 7% in sales growth, but we want to turn around our margins. International has a role in Clorox. We're executing the fundamentals well, but I will also remind everybody that we're not trying to transform the company into more of a global player. It's 20% of our portfolio, and if I project on forward to 2020, I don't expect that number to be significantly higher. Certainly, as you think about the challenges that we're seeing from an inflation point of view and in FX, I think what it will mean is that we will be more focused than ever on the activities on the margin enhancement side whether that's pricing, whether that's margin-accretive innovation, applying the strong cost savings focus that we have in the U.S. and International or this goes back to this accelerator that I mentioned moving the portfolio towards more profitable categories. That really I think will become more of a focus going forward. How can we move our portfolio towards the categories that are more profitable and less perhaps volatile. Burt's Bees is a good example, and then certainly countries that are more economically stable and attractive like Peru and like Colombia and frankly also outside of Latin America. So International has a role, but we will be very mindful to make sure that we grow but grow profitably."

As we look to the second half, I think we feel very good that we're on track to have good positive volume growth. We're very much on track to have sales growth that's solid from an organic standpoint.

I think again over the long term, we feel like both gross margins and EBIT margins are just fine for all of the businesses the segment and Burt's Bees."

On the U.S. side, again where it's cost justified and we're pricing to a long-term average cost, we'll continue to take pricing. As Benno noted, we've got a very long track record of doing this and balancing it with value. I will say forward looking that one thing that's worked for us that we want to continue is trying to marry up pricing with innovation because I think if you can bring those 2 things together, it translates into good value for the consumer at shelf, and it tends to do much better. So short answer is we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. when it's cost justified. We'd like to avoid it when we can and certainly marry it up with innovation, but if you like the recent price increases we've taken are the right ones for the long term."

Now turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15, and finally, Benno will wrap up our prepared remarks as well as open it up for Q&A. 
Consistent with today's press release, all of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated. 
Turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume was up 4%, and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies with the largest impact coming from Argentina. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 6%. Our growth reflects higher volume as well as a nearly 2-point benefit from price increases. 
Importantly, our sales results reflect strong performance across all U.S. segments and International on a currency-neutral basis. In Q2, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased 0.1 points versus the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in the quarter reflected continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. 
Inversely, we saw market share improvements in our Laundry business with Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Colour Booster at 2-year highs. 
The Home Care category also continues to strengthen. For 8 consecutive months, we've grown market share on this business with strong second quarter gains and Clorox Disinfecting Wipes leading the way. 
Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter with very strong gains in face and lip care. Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up just over 1 point in the second quarter, a nice improvement following the 0.5 point gain we saw in Q1. 
We're continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority. 
With that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume and sales each increased 3% behind strong results in our Professional Products and Home Care businesses. Our Professional Products business delivered 21% volume growth and 19% sales growth behind double-digit shipment gains in Professional Cleaning and Healthcare, along with a solid gain in Food volume. 
While concerns about Ebola and enterovirus had limited impact on our Retail business, which I will discuss in a moment, health care institutions did respond with significant purchases of cleaning and disinfecting products, contributing to top line growth for the quarter. 
Following such strong sales in Q2, we anticipate some slowdown in Professional Products in Q3 as these concerns have now abated. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased behind strong execution on several merchandising events, along with distribution gains for our toilet cleaners. This solid volume and sales growth more than offset a distribution loss on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer last calendar year, a loss that we've now anniversary-ed beginning this month. 
In the near term, we don't anticipate getting distribution back at this customer. For perspective, our focus is on profitable growth for Clorox and category health, not growth at any cost. We believe we have the right strategy in place to drive our business and category growth in a profitable manner. In particular, we continue to believe there is opportunity for increased household penetration in the wipes category, particularly as we launch meaningful innovation. 
For example, we recently launched several new products, including a wipe with micro scrubbers. It is consumer preferred versus those currently in market as well as new Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes that allow consumers to dust an entire room with one extra large wipe that picks up dust, hair and allergens such as pet dander. 
Importantly, as part of our strategy to expand wipes usage around the home, we also introduced Clorox ScrubSingles kitchen pads, which come preloaded with Clorox cleaner and are meant to be tossed after use, thereby eliminating one of the most germ-laden items in households, the reusable sponge. There's a version of ScrubSingles for use in bathrooms as well. 
As we shared with you before, Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category with market shares near 50% in tracked channels, more than twice that of the nearest branded player, and share trends have continued to improve. Early in the quarter, we did see an uptick in wipes shipments heading into the cold and flu season behind consumer concerns regarding Ebola, but heightened consumer demand moderated quickly as reported cases dwindled. With the flu season just now getting into full swing, we'll be monitoring consumption and using regional flu data to work with retailers to help target disinfecting wipe shipments where they're needed most. 
In our Laundry business, sales declined due to decreased Clorox Bleach volume as a result of category softness compared to strong category growth in the prior year. From a market share standpoint, our investment in this brand and focus on value are paying off as December marked the fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. 
Looking ahead, due to increases for input costs for our bleach business, we're in the process of implementing a 7% average price increase effective February 1. 
In our Household segment, we delivered 3% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Glad and Cat Litter businesses. Our Bags and Wraps business grew volume 3%, driven by innovation behind the Hawaiian Aloha Scent as well as new Gain-scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Sales on Glad were up double digits behind price increases taken in 2014. 
Even in the face of intense competition, Cat Litter volume and sales increased behind distribution growth of our new Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight product. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control such as with our new eliminate odor for 10 days campaign that was launched in the second quarter. 
Keeping in mind that Q2 was a relatively small quarter for our Charcoal business, sales and volume declined following double-digit growth in the first quarter as retailers transitioned to our new and improved Kingsford charcoal product that launched in January in advance of the 2015 grilling season. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew a strong 5% and sales increased 4%. These results were driven by very strong double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new Lip Crayons and new Vanilla Bean and Wild Cherry lip balm flavors grew strongly in the quarter, supported by our first-ever Burt's Bees television advertising. Our facial towelette business and skin brightening products were also very strong in the quarter. 
Turning to our Food business. Sales grew versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume for bottled and dry Hidden Valley products. Finally, the segment's positive results in Burt's Bees and Food were partially offset by lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products, primarily due to consumption declines on pour-through filters. 
As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. With our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will have a stronger second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 5% behind strong operating performance and volume growth in nearly all regions. However, sales declined 2% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
If you exclude the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. With oil and other commodity prices having fallen, capital investment in some countries has moderated, resulting in slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru. 
Strategically, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets and continue to take steps to overcome macroeconomic trends such as negative foreign currencies, high inflation and slowing GDP growth. In particular, we continue to carefully assess spending across our International division and implement price increases to mitigate the macro headwinds. 
Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015. As noted in this morning's earnings release, we've increased our sales growth outlook for the full year to be about 1%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength of the first half along with an updated outlook for the second half of the year. 
As I discussed, we anticipate some slowdown in Q3 in Professional Products following very strong Q2 shipments, in part related to Ebola and enterovirus concerns that have now greatly abated. In addition, we now anticipate stronger foreign exchange headwinds, along with higher trade spending, to support our categories and grow market shares as well as defend against reduced prices by competitors following the decline in input costs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2015."

While we're pleased to have delivered a strong second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal '15, in addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. As y",879,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're pleased to have delivered a strong second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal '15, in addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. 
As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and earnings per share to reflect our solid first half results. In our second quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth and 2 points from pricing, partially offset by 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 6%. 
Our top line results came in better than expected, driven by strength in our Glad, Professional Products and Burt's Bees businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, reflecting 130 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing, which were largely offset by 90 basis points of higher commodity cost as well as 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, reflecting continued inflationary pressures in International. 
And as we previously communicated, we continue to see significant cost pressures in the logistics and transportation market due to the tight supply of trucks and rail cars. 
Selling and administrative expense was lower in the second quarter at 14.2% of sales compared to 15% of sales in the year-ago quarter when the company made incremental investments to change IT service providers. Cost savings also contributed to lower selling and administrative expenses. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, reflecting continued strong support behind our brands, particularly to drive trial of new products. Notably, our U.S. Retail advertising spend was about 11% of sales. 
Our effective tax rate of 34.9% was almost 1 point lower versus year ago but in line with our full year projections. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97, an 8% increase versus the year-ago quarter. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $207 million compared with $159 million in the year-ago period. The increase was driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments, lower tax payments and the initial funding of the company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan last year. 
These factors were partially offset by $25 million in payments to settle interest rate hedges related to the company's issuance of long-term debt, the expense of which will be amortized over the 10-year life of the debt. In December of 2014, we issued $500 million in senior notes, increasing the company's quarter-end cash balance with proceeds subsequently used to pay down a portion of the notes that matured on January 15 of this year. 
For fiscal '15, we continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook. As Steve mentioned, our fiscal year sales outlook now anticipates sales growth of about 1%, reflecting solid first half sales results, product innovation and the benefit of pricing. 
Our sales outlook also now anticipates an even greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the range of 2% to 3%. In addition, fiscal year sales are anticipated to be impacted by slowing International economies as well as higher full year trade promotion spending as we continue to invest in our business and drive trial of new products. 
Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Given the significant decline in oil prices, we now anticipate lower resin prices in the second half, and commodity costs are expected to be about flat for the full year. For fiscal year 2015, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat as incremental demand-building investments are anticipated to offset gross margin expansion. 
We continue to anticipate our fiscal '15 tax rate to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.40 to $4.55. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the benefits from continuing commodity softness to be partially offset by continued increases in logistics costs. Also, as we've done historically, we may use a portion of the resin-related savings to address potential competitive price cuts. We'll also closely track headwinds in International markets, including foreign currency declines and slowing economies. 
Now before I turn it over to Benno, I did want to let you know that moving forward, we will provide next year's fiscal year outlook starting with fiscal 2016 during our Q4 earnings call, which takes place in August. This change allows us to provide you with an outlook based on a full year of actuals and puts us more in line with the timing of our peer groups' outlook announcements. I'm happy to address any questions you might have on this process change, but I want to make you aware of this prior to the Q3 earnings release in May. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

It's great to be joining you on my first call as Clorox's CEO, given the strong second quarter we just completed. This quarter's performance follows a very solid Q1, and it also speaks to the commitment to the 2020 Strategy and our focus on continuity with the leadership transition. 
That continuity of purpose is evident in our continued emphasis on category and overall market share improvement, profitably driving growth and stronger top line performance and creating shareholder value. Now clearly, as we head into the second half, we're facing a number of challenges, including continued softness in several categories, worsening foreign exchange headwinds and slowing economies in many international markets. 
I believe we've taken the right steps to support our brands with increased investments, while driving margin improvement to grow profitably in this difficult environment. 
And as I discussed with you on last quarter's call, the defining opportunity for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth. And looking ahead, we're leaning into 4 key elements of our 2020 Strategy that I believe drive the greatest value. These areas of emphasis, which we're calling strategy accelerators, will drive decisions around where we will invest more heavily, again with the intent to drive profitable growth. 
And I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce these to you today, and at an analyst meeting we plan on hosting later this year, we'll delve more deeply into how we're activating them. 
The first area of emphasis is accelerating portfolio momentum. In other words, leveraging tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and investing more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. 
The second is accelerating 3D technology transformation, which aims to address increasing consumer fragmentation, a shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them to win the battle for the physical and virtual shopping cart. 
The third area of emphasis is accelerating innovation. Now this isn't just about product innovation. It's about innovation in sales and marketing as well as product supply, really anything that has to do with our demand-creation model built around the 3 Ds of desire, decide and delight. Innovation in all these areas drives category growth, and we're committed to driving more of that. 
Finally, we want to accelerate our growth culture while, at the same time, maintaining our tradition of operational excellence. We want to dial up our strong Clorox culture to have an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I strongly believe these 4 areas of emphasis are what we need to drive growth while doing so profitably, and I look forward to sharing more about them with you over time. 
Now with that, let's open it up to your questions."

I'd like to remind you that we're pricing to a long-term cost advantage and not to a peak. And again, these are fully cost justified. We do have a strong track record on pricing. So over the last 10 years, 95% of our pricing increases have stuck. They're based on a very strong analytics as well, and we're in the process of talking to our retailers as we speak.

Our categories grew a little over 1%, and that's up 0.5 points from previous quarters. So that's good. And if you think about what's happening here in the U.S., you see indications of an increasing consumer confidence. The University of Michigan just issued their Consumer Sentiment Index, its highest since 2004, I believe. There's hope that there perhaps will be a higher consumer spend due to lower oil prices. So those are good things. At the same time, Household formation is still lower than it historically has been. The jobs that are created still pay less than the jobs that were lost during the recession, and there still is this bifurcation in society where the bottom half isn't really doing well. So there's puts and takes. I would say we're cautiously optimistic. Our expectation right now is still based on flat to low single-digit category growth. And for us, we focus on what we can control, and that's investing in innovation. We have a strong innovation plan also going out in Q3 of this fiscal year that we're investing behind.

They occur relatively frequently, and that's part of why we're saying that investing more in demand spending is the right thing to do. I will say though that for us, the biggest category that we're competing with them in is wipes perhaps. And if you look at the share results on wipes, we're really up strongly in wipes, and we feel like for us, the right thing to do is our focus on consumer fundamentals, focus on demand spending that drives our brand equities, on strong innovation. And certainly, in wipes, we have a very strong innovation program and focusing on pointing out to the consumer that we're delivering superior value. That's really working in the marketplace. That's what we'll be focused on, and that's not to say that we won't respond appropriately if we feel like there's very strong trade promotion going on in the category. We will defend our market shares, but I think we've always said that our focus is on earning market share and not buying market share. And on wipes in particular, that's playing out quite nicely at this point. So I would say the competitive dynamics in Home Care are strong as they always have been, but I wouldn't call them elevated at this point."

Obviously, oil has moved down pretty significantly over the last 90 days. It's not clear how long it'll stay down at these levels. So I think as we start looking at our fiscal '16 planning, we'll have to take a hard look at how long will these prices really stay at today's level. I think certainly for the next 6 months or so, we expect them to be depressed. Beyond that, I think it remains to be seen. A couple of other things I would point about the resin market. The supply-demand balance still remains fairly tight here in the U.S., and so resin prices have yet to come down. Actually, in the first half of our fiscal year, resin pricing was up. We do anticipate it'll go down in the second half, but that's mainly being driven by lower prices overseas, and that's creating some downward pressure here in the U.S. So it's good, but I would just temper expectations a bit to say it's not just energy prices, it's also the supply-demand balance. And then finally, as you think of resin, which is the largest commodity that we buy, keep in mind that historically, in this category, when you have seen a large move downward in resin pricing, more than half of that has been spent back in the category, and that's certainly what we're anticipating. So in short, it's always better to have a tailwind than a headwind, but I think at this point, we're cautiously optimistic on how that might play through in fiscal '16."

It will likely come down and help you guys out, but also help your competitors.

First of all, the price increases are cost justified. I would just point out, when you look at the total supply chain, whether it's labor inflation, health care costs, transportation costs in particular or even all the other raw material sets, those have all been moving up. So we try to price, as Benno said, to the long-term average cost. So I think we feel both the bleach increase as well as Glad is a cost-justified price increase. Now as it relates to Glad, as you know, the resin market, it actually tends to go up pretty quick and comes down slow has been the history. But there's been a long-standing issue where if prices start to come down in the spot market for resin, sometimes you'll see a step-up in merchandising activity. Well, that's certainly what we're planning for, and it's certainly baked into the outlook and our expectations. But I think we've got a long track record of managing the ups and downs of resin pricing with the Glad business quite successfully. So we've seen this story before. We managed the long-term cost, and I think we feel pretty cool about the decisions we've taken. And if conditions are different, then we think we'll manage through it."

If you look at the 3 businesses that you referenced, Ali, that grew last quarter, 2 of them really have been growing strongly for a long time. And we've always pointed out those 2 businesses, Professional and Burt's Bees, as growth areas. And like I said, we're leaning into investments, and those investments are showing good returns. Glad, I mean, I probably wouldn't expect the growth rates that we've seen in the last quarter on Glad on a consistent basis going forward, yes? But if I really look at underlying growth drivers, that's innovation. The businesses where we had strong innovation, they have grown. And as you know, we're very focused on growing our business behind innovation, and like I said, we have a very strong innovation program out there also for the fiscal year back half. So we're growing. We're growing the right way. And importantly, if you look across the segments, we're growing in all segments. So I feel good about how much we're focused on the core and which businesses are growing, and I certainly would expect Home Care also going forward to contribute more. As Steve said, we have just now a few days ago cycled through distribution loss with a major club customer so that the Wipes growth that we're seeing in tracked channels, hopefully, will be visible also in shipments as we compare them versus a year ago. On International, I think what we said in International is that what we do -- want to do is grow more profitably. We're expecting a 5% to 7% in sales growth, but we want to turn around our margins. International has a role in Clorox. We're executing the fundamentals well, but I will also remind everybody that we're not trying to transform the company into more of a global player. It's 20% of our portfolio, and if I project on forward to 2020, I don't expect that number to be significantly higher. Certainly, as you think about the challenges that we're seeing from an inflation point of view and in FX, I think what it will mean is that we will be more focused than ever on the activities on the margin enhancement side, whether that's pricing, whether that's margin-accretive innovation, applying the strong cost savings focus that we have in the U.S. and International or this goes back to this accelerator that I mentioned moving the portfolio towards more profitable categories. That really, I think, will become more of a focus going forward. How can we move our portfolio towards the categories that are more profitable and less perhaps volatile. Burt's Bees is a good example, and then certainly countries that are more economically stable and attractive like Peru and like Colombia in and, frankly, also outside Latin America. So International has a role, but we will be very mindful to make sure that we grow but grow profitably."

We came in at about 4% currency-neutral sales growth. As we look to the second half, I think we feel very good that we're on track to have good positive volume growth. We're very much on track to have sales growth that's solid from an organic standpoint. I think the big wildcard that we're all watching pretty carefully is what happens with foreign currencies.

We've seen margins up here in the first half of 2015, but over the last few years, the margins in that segment have come down a little bit, and yet it's still a really profitable segment for you. And I'm just wondering ballpark, competition in at least the on-the-go segment for Brita looks like it's going to get a little bit tougher now Newell has made some acquisitions. It sounds like you're investing more on the advertising line for Bees. I don't know what's going on with margins in Dressings and Sauces. But I guess the question is, how confident are you that, that Lifestyle segment can sustain a margin 28% and above, if you will, of pretax margin?"

We're also investing more to drive growth in that segment, particularly on the Burt's Bees business. So the margins are fundamentally healthy. I think we believe we've got good opportunities to expand them over time, but because they are such healthy margins leaning into the growth side of that -- this business certainly seems right to us and that's what you're seeing."

And it's quite possible that we might be looking at the smaller -- some of the smaller businesses. But in general, very, very comfortable with the portfolio and don't feel the need to do anything different. We want to grow bigger rather than smaller, and I think what we've said is that we're interested in bolt-on acquisitions to the tune of $25 million to $100 million in areas that are growth areas for us and that are margin accretive, on strategy, fit with our capabilities and that ideally are U.S. centric. So we're looking in whether that's health and wellness or natural personal care or food enhancers and see if we can add, and that's really the mindset that we're in.

So I think it was a clean set of numbers, and there's not any one thing I can point to. And even from a retailer standpoint, it's again not any specific channel. I think it was just across the board. It was solid healthy growth for the company."

I think most of the pricing we've taken to date has really been focused on the international markets where we're dealing with much higher rates of inflation, continue to see us lean into that. On the U.S. side, again, where it's cost justified and we're pricing to a long-term average cost, we'll continue to take pricing. As Benno noted, we've got a very long track record of doing this and balancing it with value. I will say forward looking that one thing that's worked for us that we want to continue is trying to marry up pricing with innovation because I think if you can bring those 2 things together, it translates into good value for the consumer at shelf, and it tends to do much better. So short answer is we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. when it's cost justified. We'd like to avoid it when we can and certainly marry it up with innovation, but we feel like the recent price increases we've taken are the right ones for the long term."

Now turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15, and finally, Benno will wrap up our prepared remarks as well as open it up for Q&A. 
Consistent with today's press release, all of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated. 
Turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume was up 4%, and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, with the largest impact coming from Argentina. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 6%. Our growth reflects higher volume as well as a nearly 2-point benefit from price increases. 
Importantly, our sales results reflect strong performance across all U.S. segments and International on a currency-neutral basis. In Q2, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased 0.1 points versus the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in the quarter reflected continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. 
Conversely, we saw market share improvements in our Laundry business, with Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Colour Booster at 2-year highs. 
The Home Care category also continues to strengthen. For 8 consecutive months, we've grown market share in this business with strong second quarter gains and Clorox Disinfecting Wipes leading the way. 
Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter with very strong gains in face and lip care. Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up just over 1 point in the second quarter, a nice improvement following the 0.5 point gain we saw in Q1. 
We're continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority. 
With that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume and sales each increased 3% behind strong results in our Professional Products and Home Care businesses. Our Professional Products business delivered 21% volume growth and 19% sales growth behind double-digit shipment gains in Professional Cleaning and Healthcare, along with a solid gain in Food volume. 
While concerns about Ebola and enterovirus had limited impact on our Retail business, which I will discuss in a moment, health care institutions did respond with significant purchases of cleaning and disinfecting products, contributing to top line growth for the quarter. 
Following such strong sales in Q2, we anticipate some slowdown in Professional Products in Q3 as these concerns have now abated. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased behind strong execution on several merchandising events, along with distribution gains for our toilet cleaners. This solid volume and sales growth more than offset a distribution loss on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer last calendar year, a loss that we've now anniversary-ed beginning this month. 
In the near term, we don't anticipate getting distribution back at this customer. For perspective, our focus is on profitable growth for Clorox and category health, not growth at any cost. We believe we have the right strategy in place to drive our business and category growth in a profitable manner. In particular, we continue to believe there is opportunity for increased household penetration in the wipes category, particularly as we launch meaningful innovation. 
For example, we recently launched several new products, including a wipe with micro scrubbers. It is consumer preferred versus those currently in market, as well as new Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes that allow consumers to dust an entire room with one extra large wipe that picks up dust, hair and allergens such as pet dander. 
Importantly, as part of our strategy to expand wipes usage around the home, we also introduced Clorox ScrubSingles kitchen pads, which come preloaded with Clorox cleaner and are meant to be tossed after use, thereby eliminating one of the most germ-laden items in households, the reusable sponge. There's a version of ScrubSingles for use in bathrooms as well. 
As we shared with you before, Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category, with market shares near 50% in tracked channels, more than twice that of the nearest branded player, and share trends have continued to improve. Early in the quarter, we did see an uptick in wipes shipments heading into the cold and flu season behind consumer concerns regarding Ebola, but heightened consumer demand moderated quickly as reported cases dwindled. With the flu season just now getting into full swing, we'll be monitoring consumption and using regional flu data to work with retailers to help target disinfecting wipe shipments where they're needed most. 
In our Laundry business, sales declined due to decreased Clorox Bleach volume as a result of category softness compared to strong category growth in the prior year. From a market share standpoint, our investment in this brand and focus on value are paying off, as December marked the fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. 
Looking ahead, due to increases for input costs for our Bleach business, we're in the process of implementing a 7% average price increase effective February 1. 
In our Household segment, we delivered 3% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Glad and Cat Litter businesses. Our Bags and Wraps business grew volume 3%, driven by innovation behind the Hawaiian Aloha Scent, as well as new Gain-scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Sales on Glad were up double digits behind price increases taken in 2014. 
Even in the face of intense competition, Cat Litter volume and sales increased behind distribution growth of our new Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight product. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control, such as with our new ""eliminate odor for 10 days"" campaign that was launched in the second quarter. 
Keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for our Charcoal business, sales and volume declined following double-digit growth in the first quarter, as retailers transitioned to our new and improved Kingsford charcoal product that launched in January in advance of the 2015 grilling season. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew a strong 5% and sales increased 4%. These results were driven by very strong double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new Lip Crayons and new Vanilla Bean and Wild Cherry lip balm flavors grew strongly in the quarter, supported by our first-ever Burt's Bees television advertising. Our facial towelette business and skin brightening products were also very strong in the quarter. 
Turning to our Food business. Sales grew versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume for bottled and dry Hidden Valley products. Finally, the segment's positive results in Burt's Bees and Food were partially offset by lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products, primarily due to consumption declines on pour-through filters. 
As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. With our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will have a stronger second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 5% behind strong operating performance and volume growth in nearly all regions. However, sales declined 2% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
If you exclude the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. With oil and other commodity prices having fallen, capital investment in some countries has moderated, resulting in slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru. 
Strategically, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets and continue to take steps to overcome macroeconomic trends such as negative foreign currencies, high inflation and slowing GDP growth. In particular, we continue to carefully assess spending across our International division and implement price increases to mitigate the macro headwinds. 
Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015. As noted in this morning's earnings release, we've increased our sales growth outlook for the full year to be about 1%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength of the first half along with an updated outlook for the second half of the year. 
As I discussed, we anticipate some slowdown in Q3 in Professional Products following very strong Q2 shipments, in part related to Ebola and enterovirus concerns that have now greatly abated. In addition, we now anticipate stronger foreign exchange headwinds, along with higher trade spending, to support our categories and grow market shares, as well as defend against reduced prices by competitors following the decline in input costs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2015."
89450,281091234,754970,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone.

Well, we're pleased to have delivered a strong second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal '15. In addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. 
As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and earnings per share to reflect our solid first half results. In our second quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth and 2 points from pricing, partially offset by 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 6%. 
Our top line results came in better than expected, driven by strength in our Glad, Professional Products and Burt's Bees businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, reflecting 130 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing, which were largely offset by 90 basis points of higher commodity cost as well as 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, reflecting continued inflationary pressures in International. 
And as we previously communicated, we continue to see significant cost pressures in the logistics and transportation market due to the tight supply of trucks and rail cars. 
Selling and administrative expense was lower in the second quarter at 14.2% of sales, compared to 15% of sales in the year-ago quarter when the company made incremental investments to change IT service providers. Cost savings also contributed to lower selling and administrative expenses. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, reflecting continued strong support behind our brands, particularly to drive trial of new products. Notably, our U.S. Retail advertising spend was about 11% of sales. 
Our effective tax rate of 34.9% was almost 1 point lower versus year ago but in line with our full year projections. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97, an 8% increase versus the year-ago quarter. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $207 million, compared with $159 million in the year-ago period. The increase was driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments, lower tax payments and the initial funding of the company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan last year. 
These factors were partially offset by $25 million in payments to settle interest rate hedges related to the company's issuance of long-term debt, the expense of which will be amortized over the 10-year life of the debt. In December of 2014, we issued $500 million in senior notes, increasing the company's quarter-end cash balance, with proceeds subsequently used to pay down a portion of the notes that matured on January 15 of this year. 
For fiscal '15, we continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook. As Steve mentioned, our fiscal year sales outlook now anticipates sales growth of about 1%, reflecting solid first half sales results, product innovation and the benefit of pricing. 
Our sales outlook also now anticipates an even greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the range of 2% to 3%. In addition, fiscal year sales are anticipated to be impacted by slowing International economies, as well as higher full year trade promotion spending, as we continue to invest in our business and drive trial of new products. 
Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year, as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Given the significant decline in oil prices, we now anticipate lower resin prices in the second half, and commodity costs are expected to be about flat for the full year. For fiscal year 2015, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, as incremental demand-building investments are anticipated to offset gross margin expansion. 
We continue to anticipate our fiscal '15 tax rate to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.40 to $4.55. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the benefits from continuing commodity softness to be partially offset by continued increases in logistics costs. Also, as we've done historically, we may use a portion of the resin-related savings to address potential competitive price cuts. We'll also closely track headwinds in International markets, including foreign currency declines and slowing economies. 
Now before I turn it over to Benno, I did want to let you know that moving forward, we will provide next year's fiscal year outlook, starting with fiscal 2016, during our Q4 earnings call, which takes place in August. This change allows us to provide you with an outlook based on a full year of actuals and puts us more in line with the timing of our peer groups' outlook announcements. I'm happy to address any questions you might have on this process change, but I wanted to make you aware of this prior to the Q3 earnings release in May. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

It's great to be joining you on my first call as Clorox's CEO, given the strong second quarter we just completed. This quarter's performance follows a very solid Q1, and it also speaks to the commitment to the 2020 Strategy and our focus on continuity with the leadership transition. 
That continuity of purpose is evident in our continued emphasis on category and overall market share improvement, profitably driving growth and stronger top line performance and creating shareholder value. Now clearly, as we head into the second half, we're facing a number of challenges, including continued softness in several categories, worsening foreign exchange headwinds and slowing economies in many international markets. 
I believe we're taking the right steps to support our brands with increased investments, while driving margin improvement to grow profitably in this difficult environment. 
And as I discussed with you on last quarter's call, the defining opportunity for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth. And looking ahead, we're leaning into 4 key elements of our 2020 Strategy that I believe drive the greatest value. These areas of emphasis, which we're calling strategy accelerators, will drive decisions around where we will invest more heavily, again, with the intent to drive profitable growth. 
And I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce these to you today, and at an analyst meeting we plan on hosting later this year, we'll delve more deeply into how we're activating them. 
The first area of emphasis is accelerating portfolio momentum. In other words, leveraging tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and investing more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. 
The second is accelerating 3D technology transformation, which aims to address increasing consumer fragmentation, a shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them to win the battle for their physical and virtual shopping cart. 
The third area of emphasis is accelerating innovation. Now this isn't just about product innovation. It's about innovation in sales and marketing as well as product supply, really anything that has to do with our demand-creation model built around the 3 Ds of desire, decide and delight. Innovation in all these areas drives category growth, and we're committed to driving more of that. 
Finally, we want to accelerate our growth culture while, at the same time, maintaining our tradition of operational excellence. We want to dial up our strong Clorox culture to have an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I strongly believe these 4 areas of emphasis are what we need to drive growth while doing so profitably, and I look forward to sharing more about them with you over time. 
Now with that, let's open it up to your questions."

Our categories grew a little over 1%, and that's up 0.5 points from previous quarters. So that's good. And if you think about what's happening here in the U.S., you see indications of an increasing consumer confidence. The University of Michigan just issued their Consumer Sentiment Index, its highest since 2004, I believe. There's hope that there perhaps will be a higher consumer spend due to lower oil prices. So those are good things. At the same time, household formation is still lower than it historically has been. The jobs that are created still pay less than the jobs that were lost during the recession, and there still is this bifurcation in society where the bottom half isn't really doing well. So there's puts and takes. I would say we're cautiously optimistic. Our expectation right now is still based on flat to low single-digit category growth. And for us, we focus on what we can control, and that's investing in innovation. We have a strong innovation plan also going out in Q3 of this fiscal year that we're investing behind. And we've talked to you in the past about increasing our demand spend by 1 point of net sales over time. That's called for by our strategy, and we're certainly leaning into that, a focus on delivering better value than competitors in private label. So we feel like we're doing what we can do to drive category growth, but I would like to let this play out in the marketplace for a quarter or 2. It's really too early to call it a positive trend."

And if you look at the share results on wipes, we're really up strongly in wipes, and we feel like for us, the right thing to do is focus on consumer fundamentals, focus on demand spending that drives our brand equities, on strong innovation. And certainly, in wipes, we have a very strong innovation program and focusing on pointing out to the consumer that we're delivering superior value. That's really working in the marketplace. That's what we'll be focused on, and that's not to say that we won't respond appropriately if we feel like there's very strong trade promotion going on in the category.

Obviously, oil has moved down pretty significantly over the last 90 days. It's not clear how long it'll stay down at these levels. So I think as we start looking at our fiscal '16 planning, we'll have to take a hard look at how long will these prices really stay at today's level. I think certainly for the next 6 months or so, we expect them to be depressed. Beyond that, I think it remains to be seen. A couple of other things I would point out about the resin market. The supply-demand balance still remains fairly tight here in the U.S., and so resin prices have yet to come down. Actually, in the first half of our fiscal year, resin pricing was up. We do anticipate it'll go down in the second half, but that's mainly being driven by lower prices overseas, and that's creating some downward pressure here in the U.S. So it's good, but I would just temper expectations a bit to say it's not just energy prices, it's also the supply-demand balance. And then finally, as you think of resin, which is the largest commodity that we buy, keep in mind that historically, in this category, when you have seen a large move downward in resin pricing, more than half of that has been spent back in the category, and that's certainly what we're anticipating. So in short, it's always better to have a tailwind than a headwind, but I think at this point, we're cautiously optimistic on how that might play through in fiscal '16."

First of all, the price increases are cost justified. I would just point out, when you look at the total supply chain, whether it's labor inflation, health care costs, transportation costs in particular or even all the other raw material sets, those have all been moving up. So we try to price, as Benno said, to the long-term average cost. So I think we feel both the bleach increase as well as Glad is a cost-justified price increase. Now as it relates to Glad, as you know, the resin market, it actually tends to go up pretty quick and comes down slow has been the history. But there's been a long-standing issue where if prices start to come down in the spot market for resin, sometimes you'll see a step-up in merchandising activity. Well, that's certainly what we're planning for, and it's certainly baked into the outlook and our expectations. But I think we've got a long track record of managing the ups and downs of resin pricing with the Glad business quite successfully. So we've seen this story before. We manage through to the long-term cost, and I think we feel pretty good about the decisions we've taken. And if conditions are different, then we think we'll manage through it."

If you look at the 3 businesses that you referenced, Ali, that grew last quarter, 2 of them really have been growing strongly for a long time. And we've always pointed out those 2 businesses, Professional and Burt's Bees, as growth areas. And like I said, we're leaning into investments, and those investments are showing good returns. Glad, I mean, I probably wouldn't expect the growth rates that we've seen in the last quarter on Glad on a consistent basis going forward, yes? But if I really look at underlying growth drivers, that's innovation. The businesses where we've had strong innovation, they have grown. And as you know, we're very focused on growing our business behind innovation, and like I said, we have a very strong innovation program out there also for the fiscal year back half. So we're growing. We're growing the right way. And importantly, if you look across the segments, we're growing in all segments. So I feel good about how much we're focused on the core and which businesses are growing, and I certainly would expect Home Care also going forward to contribute more. As Steve said, we have just now a few days ago cycled through distribution loss with a major club customer so that the Wipes growth that we're seeing in tracked channels, hopefully, will be visible also in shipments as we compare them versus a year ago. On International, I think what we said in International is that what we do -- want to do is grow more profitably. We're expecting a 5% to 7% in sales growth, but we want to turn around our margins. International has a role in Clorox. We're executing the fundamentals well, but I will also remind everybody that we're not trying to transform the company into more of a global player. It's 20% of our portfolio, and if I project on forward to 2020, I don't expect that number to be significantly higher. Certainly, as you think about the challenges that we're seeing from an inflation point of view and in FX, I think what it will mean is that we will be more focused than ever on the activities on the margin enhancement side, whether that's pricing, whether that's margin-accretive innovation, applying the strong cost savings focus that we have in the U.S. and International, or this goes back to this accelerator that I mentioned, moving the portfolio towards more profitable categories. That really, I think, will become more of a focus going forward. How can we move our portfolio towards the categories that are more profitable and less perhaps volatile. Burt's Bees is a good example, and then certainly countries that are more economically stable and attractive like Peru and like Colombia in and, frankly, also outside Latin America. So International has a role, but we will be very mindful to make sure that we grow, but grow profitably."

And again, the outlook is 2% to 3% there, but we could be at the mid or upper end of that range kind of based on where the spot rates are today. But absent that, I think the organic plans that we have are performing quite well for the company."

I think most of the pricing we've taken to date has really been focused on the international markets, where we're dealing with much higher rates of inflation. You'll continue to see us lean into that. On the U.S. side, again, where it's cost justified and we're pricing to a long-term average cost, we'll continue to take pricing. As Benno noted, we've got a very long track record of doing this and balancing it with value. I will say forward looking that one thing that's worked for us that we want to continue is trying to marry up pricing with innovation because I think if you can bring those 2 things together, it translates into good value for the consumer at shelf, and it tends to do much better. So short answer is we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. when it's cost justified. We'd like to avoid it when we can and certainly marry it up with innovation, but we feel like the recent price increases we've taken are the right ones for the long term."

So with that, I'll start by covering highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and updated financial outlook for fiscal year '15, and finally, Benno will provide his perspective, and then we'll open it up for your questions. 
Please recognize that all today's commentary is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. 
Turning to our top line results. In Q3, volume was up 1%, and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currencies with the largest impact coming from Argentina, Canada and Australia. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 5%. 
Our growth reflects higher volume and favorable mix as well as a nearly 3-point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect growth across all U.S. segments and International on a currency-neutral basis. 
In Q3, our U.S. 13-week market shares increased 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter. This is the largest market share increase in the past 4 years and reflects share growth in 6 of our 8 tracked categories. 
Our third quarter increase reflected strong gains in our Home Care and the Laundry businesses with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Clorox Liquid Bleach leading the way. Brita, Glad, Charcoal and Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter. 
Conversely, we saw market share declines on our Cat Litter business as competitive intensity remained high. To address the challenges in our Litter business, we continue to drive our new Lightweight product along with harder-hitting advertising and packaging claims on our overall Fresh Step business. 
In addition, we have innovation coming out in the Cat Litter category that we anticipate will result in improved share trends in calendar year 2016. 
Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up 2 points in the third quarter, a strong improvement following the 0.5 points gain we saw in Q1 and more than 1 point gain that we saw in Q2. We are continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains the top priority. 
With that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 1%, primarily due to strong results in our Home Care business. Sales also grew 1% with gains across all Cleaning segment businesses. 
In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased 1% behind strong execution of merchandising events, particularly for Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, along with strong performance of new Wipes with micro scrubbers that we began shipping at the start of the fiscal year. While it's too early to get a definitive read on performance, sales also benefited from the launch of 3 new products: Clorox ScrubSingles, Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes and Clorox Pump and Clean. 
Our Professional Products business grew sales 3% in the third quarter, particularly behind increased shipments in our food service channel. As we discussed last quarter, following double-digit Q2 sales growth behind Ebola and enterovirus concerns, we anticipated some slowdown in third quarter Professional Products growth as those concerns abated. Looking ahead, we anticipate our Professional Products business will continue to grow faster than the company average. 
In our Laundry business, sales increased 1% due to growth in Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster. As noted last quarter, due to increased input costs, we implemented a 7% average price increase on Clorox Bleach effective February 1. The price increase was well-executed in the market. However, competitors have been somewhat slow to follow. From a market share standpoint, our strong execution is paying off as Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. 
In our Household segment, volume was flat while sales increased 5%. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal businesses, which grew volume and sales at a double-digit rate on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. 
Charcoal's strong top line results were driven by converting to a new and improved Lightweight product that began shipping in January, supported by increased demand-building investments as well as strong early-season performance in key retailers. 
Our Bags & Wraps business grew sales 1% driven by innovation behind the new Gain-scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Volume on Glad declined 9%, reflecting the impact of price increases taken last March and November on our trash bag business. Although competition has not yet followed, we continue to believe our pricing actions are right for the long term with signs the resin market is firming up. In addition, we anticipate reinvesting a portion of our pricing benefit in trade spending to manage price gaps and to invest in innovation on our premium lines of business. 
Cat Litter volume and sales decreased 3% and 2%, respectively, in the face of competitive activity. We're continuing to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent pumping and odor control such as with Fresh Step's eliminate odor for 10 days claim that comes with a money back guarantee. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 2% while sales grew 3%. These results were driven by a high single-digit sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new Lip Crayons grew strongly in the quarter supported by new Burt's Bees television advertising as did our Renewal face line, facial towelettes and skin brightening products. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, sales growth will likely be lower than year ago as we lap the strong merchandising and pipeline build for the lip crayon products. Full year results for Burt's Bees continue to track to high single-digit growth, and we look forward to another strong year in fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our Food business. Volume grew 1%, and sales grew 2% versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume of bottled and dry Hidden Valley products, including the February launch of 5 new flavored Hidden Valley Ranch dressings and 2 new Greek yogurt drip -- dry dip and dressing mixes. Partially offsetting the Burt's Bees and Food gains were lower sales and shipments of water filtration products due to category softness and intense competition in pour-through filters. 
As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters, and it's getting strong reviews in e-commerce channels. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. We're keenly focused on getting our consumer messaging right, and coupled with our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will improve in fiscal year 2016. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 1%, and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 10%. 
In the quarter, International saw market share gains in Canada in local currency terms, and we grew volume share in Latin America, particularly in bleach and cleaners. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to see economic -- slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru, given macroeconomic trends such as high inflation and slow GDP growth. 
That said, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets as we continue to carefully assess spending across geographies and implement price increases to partially mitigate the macroeconomic headwinds. 
Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015. As noted in this morning's press release, we've increased our sales growth outlook for the year to be in a range of 1% to 2%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength seen year-to-date. 
For the fourth quarter, we continued to anticipate strong foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares as well as to defend against reduced prices by competitors. 
Now I'll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015."
89450,290174879,800691,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 01, 2015",2015-05-01,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter following a solid first half of fiscal 2015.

We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter following a solid first half of fiscal 2015. As you saw in our press release, given our results today, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and updated earnings per share from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the third quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of pricing, a little over 1 point of favorable mix and assortment and nearly 1 point of volume growth. These factors were partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 point of higher trade spending. 
On our currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points to 43.2%, reflecting 170 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of increased manufacturing and logistics costs and about 60 basis points of higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. For the quarter, commodity costs were about flat. 
Selling and administrative expenses increased 16% in the third quarter to 14.7% of sales compared to 13% of sales in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by significantly higher performance-based compensation costs, reflecting higher anticipated year-over-year payouts, which recognizes the company's strong performance today. While the largest impact from higher incentive compensation costs was reflected in selling and administrative expenses, it also resulted in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. Importantly, for the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate that selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, consistent with our long-term target. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was nearly 9% of sales with U.S. spending for the quarter at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. businesses. 
Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, a $0.06 decrease versus the year-ago quarter due largely to the higher year-over-year incentive compensation costs. As a reminder, in the year-ago period, earnings had a $0.12 benefit due to unusually low incentive compensation costs, again consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $398 million compared with $357 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. In keeping with our practice in returning excess cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, fiscal year-to-date, the company has repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $158 million. 
Now I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2015. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook, which now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting stronger results to date and an impact of more than 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currencies. Our sales outlook also reflects slowing International economies, increased trade spending as we continue to support our brand. 
Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
We also continue to anticipate that commodity cost will be about flat for the full year as year-to-date headwinds should be offset by lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, reflecting moderate gross margin expansion, offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. 
Our fiscal year EBIT margin also reflects incremental demand-building investments. We continue to anticipate fiscal 2015 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be about 34%. And net all of these factors, we have updated our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.45 to $4.55. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we're going to be keenly focused on 3 things. First, headwinds in International markets, including slowing economies and foreign currency declines, which we anticipate to be higher than this year's expected level of more than 2% and will impact both top and bottom line results. In particular, we anticipate a meaningful currency devaluation in Argentina sometime in fiscal year 2016. 
Second, we continue to monitor changes in commodity costs. Despite the current softness in resin prices, we're seeing early signs that the market may be firming up. In addition, logistics costs remain high, which will likely continue into next year. 
And third, we will invest heavily in our brands. As I mentioned previously, historically, we've invested a portion of the resin-related savings back into the business. In particular, we anticipate continuing to invest in trade promotion especially in categories where competitors have yet to follow our pricing actions. 
As a reminder, we will provide our outlook for fiscal year 2016 in early August. 
In closing, I feel really good about our results this quarter despite the headwinds we continue to face. We continue to be encouraged by the actions we're taking to accelerate growth in our U.S. businesses and plan to continue investing. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies that allowed us to expand our margins, which supports our focus on driving profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As we've shared with you, the central aspect of our 2020 Strategy is to drive profitable growth. And consistent with that strategy while facing significant foreign exchange headwinds and cost increases in Q3, we focused on growing profitably through strong execution of our Desire, Decide and Delight demand-building model based on delivering better value to consumers; through launching meaningful innovations across many categories, increasing brand investments in the U.S., delivering strong cost savings and executing price increases where they're justified. 
As a result, we drove category and overall market share improvements and saw further revitalization of our U.S. Retail business. We generated stronger top line results. We expanded gross margin, and we raised our sales outlook and updated our EPS outlook for the fiscal year. 
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, I remain confident in our strategy and our keen focus on accelerating profitable growth to create value for our stockholders. The strategy accelerator I shared with you last quarter are driving decisions around where we will invest more heavily again with the intent to drive profitable growth. 
By accelerating portfolio momentum, we've taken advantage of tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and invest more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to growth. We're pleased to see this reflected in our Q3 share growth, which was the strongest we've seen in 4 years. 
By accelerating 3D technology transformation, we are addressing the shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them. As we focus on winning the battle for the physical and virtual shopping cart, we've solidified partnerships with key retailer partners to accelerate our e-commerce strategy. 
By accelerating innovation across our demand-creation model of Desire, Decide and Delight, we are driving category growth. I'm pleased with the progress we're making, and this quarter, we launched meaningful innovation across several categories. Although early days, several of these are exceeding expectations. 
And finally, by accelerating our growth culture while maintaining operational excellence, we're driving an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I believe these are the right strategies, particularly as we manage our business in the face of challenges that Steve Robb noted earlier: slowing economies in International markets and strong foreign exchange headwinds, a volatile commodity market and the need to continue to invest in trade promotions to support our brands against competition. 
And with that, we'll open it up to your questions."

But if I take your full year guidance of 1% to 2% in the top line and assume just a starting point Q4 gross margin looks like Q3 in terms of expansion. That's got to put your gross margin performance for the year up about 40 basis points, if my math is correct. So I guess first, is 40 basis points line up is moderate for you? And then second, is there any reason why gross margin expansion shouldn't actually accelerate in Q4 given the magnitude of the presumed commodity benefits and the continued cost saves? I know you fly the higher trade promotion in your outlook a couple of times, and I'm assuming that's particularly focused on Glad, where you got the price gap issue, but just how significant a spike in gross-to-net are you expecting in Q4 if you can size that order of magnitude versus Q3."

Obviously, we're very pleased with the results we saw in the third quarter, where we added almost a little over a full point of gross margin. And what we saw in the third quarter, and this is relevant to the fourth quarter, strong cost savings programs, pricing actions that are working in the market. In the third quarter, commodity costs were flat, and so all of those benefits flowed through. When you look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel great about the pricing. We feel very good about the cost savings, and importantly, we expect to get some commodity cost tailwinds, okay? And that will probably be the first quarter this year, where we're actually getting tailwinds so I would expect meaningful gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Now for the full year, stepping back, we do expect EBIT margin to be about flat, and the reason for that is we are going to continue to step up our investments in consumer demand-building investments, and our SG&A costs are expected to be about 14% for the full year. So I think some of the benefit in the fourth quarter and gross margin will be offset by some of these other factors, but nonetheless, you should see some pretty nice numbers."

And it's fair to say that at this point, we're not meeting those expectations. I would say that operationally, we're executing well, but we all know this is a very challenging environment that will likely continue well into next fiscal year. The key drivers to your question, a lot of them are macroeconomic in nature around GDP, around cost inflation, price controls and FX. Again, these are factors that our peers are seeing as well, and they're pretty well established. Going forward, our focus will be on rebuilding margin. I'm not happy about the profitability, and rebuilding margin is our first priority, and I would point out a few key tactics: one, continued pricing to offset inflation; two, innovation where margin accretive that drives trade up, and we're seeing good results behind tactics like this in markets like Argentina, and there's more that we can, and we'll do; three, we will really be very disciplined about demand spending. We will spend where it's profitable and where we feel like there's going to be a long-term growth effect. We will not spend if the profitability is not there. And then fourth, we have intensified our efforts to apply what we think is a solid playbook from the U.S. on the cost savings side, and we will do more of that. So going forward, I do not expect us to be on the growth trajectory, the 5% to 7% in sales growth that I mentioned earlier anytime soon, but I do think that we can do better to start rebuilding our margin, and that again will be our priority near term, given all the challenges that are largely macroeconomic in nature."

It implies a sort of down 2% to plus 2% for the fourth quarter. Plus 2% seems like it should be pretty much -- should be a pretty achievable target. So the question is why not just go from 1% to 2%? Or is there real risk that your top line is materially weaker than just 2% in the fourth quarter?"

Starting with the latter question, which is regarding the outlook. Again the outlook for sales growth for the full year is 1% to 2% all in, including foreign currencies. That'll be clear. Fiscal year-to-date, we delivered about 2% sales growth, a little over 2% sales growth all in. I think as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting sales growth to be probably flat to up slightly. The things that we're monitoring carefully right now number one, is just foreign currencies. There's a lot of volatility there. Second, our Charcoal business, which, by the way, is off to a great start and certainly in the third quarter, but it's a seasonal business. It's historically had some volatility. So we'll need see how that plays out, and then finally, we're going to continue to invest in our business. So I think on balance, it's fair to say based on what we know that we're probably in the mid- to upper end of that range of the 1% to 2%. Turning to your question on International. It is challenging because you've got foreign exchange, which is certainly placing a drag on the margins in our International business because like many companies that have businesses in the emerging markets, you pay for a lot of your costs in dollars, and as a result, you kind of take a double hit on that. We are seeing benefits of lower commodity costs beginning to trickle through to International but probably to a less extent than we're seeing in the U.S. because the inflationary pressures are higher in the International markets and where possible, we try to source materials locally and try to pay in local currencies. So I think the margin challenges in International are a bit more acute. And I think as Benno said, that's why we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to lean into pricing. We're going to continue to drive hard against our cost savings. We're going to get smart about how we allocate our investment spend, and then finally, I think there is more opportunity to lower SG&A cost globally but particularly in International, you'll see us focus on that as well."

What we've seen, and this is not unique to Clorox as we've talked many times before, there's 2 fundamental problems in logistics that everybody's facing. Simply not enough drivers and trucks, part of that is changing rules and regulations, part of it's probably a fallout from the economic slowdown. A lot of trucking companies went out of businesses, but there's just not enough trucks on the road. And rail has been somewhat congested. That's been driving up somewhat overall logistics costs. I think this area may be impacting Clorox a bit more than other companies because some of our plants are more rural locations. We have longer shipping lanes, and we also tend to ship things like bleach and Charcoal and Cat Litter, which weigh a bit more, and so you pay a bit more there. So it's an ongoing pressure. It's something that we fully expect will continue through next year, which is why again we're focusing on pricing and cost savings to address it. In terms of the outlook for commodity cost, again as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate commodity costs to be about flat on the year, but we do expect to get some tailwinds in the fourth quarter. What we're watching very carefully right now is energy prices. Energy prices over the last 4 to 8 weeks have moved up pretty sharply, and one of the things we know over time is that commodity costs tend to come down slowly, but they move up pretty quickly. And so resin prices appear to have found the bottom. They're starting to firm up. I do expect that in the fourth quarter, there'll be some tailwinds, and there might be some tailwinds going into early fiscal '16. But we're just giving a sharp eye on this because these markets have a tendency to swing pretty quickly, but we'll have a better update for you in early August when we provide our outlook for fiscal '16."

Our price increase was executed successfully, and on the competitive side, I would say at this point, it's early days, and we need to let this play out. Some accounts did follow on the private-label side, some not yet. So it's not clear where this will end up. I would offer a few pieces of perspective. First of all, the price increases continue to be cost justified. Our competitors see the same cost increases that we do. So again, early days. We need to let this play out. We do have a strong track record obviously taking price increases over the long term. We know how to execute pricing, and we are totally committed to growing our categories profitably. We had anticipated the need to spend some of the pricing benefit back in trade promotion. This is exactly what's happening. This is exactly what is reflected in our outlook. So we are staying the course on pricing on bleach and also on Glad for that matter but to also stay agile if needed. So if we need to course correct down the road, we will. But at this point, my expectation is that this price increase will be executed successfully. We'll probably see, also as a disclaimer, volumes and shares over a few quarters be somewhat depressed. Again, that's a normal thing. And after 3 to 4 quarters, once consumers are used to new price points, we should see that ease up and normalize, but overall, I would say the price increases are on track."

Brita has been soft recently and certainly on the share side, we're seeing some improvement. It's, to be honest, early, too early to say that we've turned the corner, but I'm certainly feeling better. The issue on Brita has been private-label filter distribution expansion, which led our share and volume to be under pressure and also has led the category to be -- to a decline. We are focused on innovation, innovation on systems but also innovation on filters to differentiate from private label. That work is underway, and we see good progress. We're also working with retailers to reverse the trade down in the category and revitalize the category, and I expect better results in fiscal year 2016. The good news is on Brita that our pour-through systems, which is the majority of the business, is growing, and that's typically a precursor to higher filter sales. So that's a green shoot, and I think Brita will see growth in the next fiscal year, and I'm quite optimistic. Litter, obviously, no surprise, not yet where we want it to be. What we've always said is that it will take a few quarters until we can expect improvements, and I will say that I think that it will take until fiscal year 2016 also. We're focused on earning share and not buying share, which ultimately requires better renovation. We've put a few things in place that are beginning to take hold. We're investing in better value communication. Lightweight Litter, which we've launched earlier this fiscal year, has been quite successful, and we're investing behind it. And as Steve Austenfeld said earlier in the call, we have strong innovation coming out in the next fiscal year, which is ultimately what it will take. So pleased with the progress but also offer as a perspective that Litter is growing both volume and sales fiscal year-to-date. So that share number is certainly the one number that I don't like and no one here at Clorox likes. But to put it in perspective, we are, nevertheless, growing, and we feel good about our prospects for 2016 and beyond."

So we're certainly feeling very good about our ability to convert sales to cash, and it gives us a lot of financial flexibility. We started to use some of that money as we've discussed for the last few quarters to invest for growth, and we've been putting more money into growth, and it's really working. We're going to keep the dividend healthy, but you saw us in the third quarter reenter the market for share repurchases essentially to start offsetting stock option dilution that's occurred over the last couple of quarters. I think longer term, what you'll see us do is we'll continue to obviously support the growth of our business organically with investments. We continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions in the areas that we've discussed, and we'll keep the dividend healthy and return cash that we don't need back to the shareholders.

I would also say that look, at the end of the day, this temporarily higher spend on trade is just one component of what we're doing. I would ask that we also consider that we're investing very strongly in innovation. A lot of our trade spend today goes against fast distribution and innovation. We're seeing several innovations off to a fast start. On the distribution front, we are pleased with the progress on the Cleaning innovation.

So first, what's behind this is we've been on a strategy in Charcoal to encourage year-round merchandising for a while, and that's certainly been very successful.

If you think about what's happened in much of the country weather-wise, there was pent-up demand, and there was readiness also by retailers to invest in Charcoal, to get people back into the stores and encourage store traffic, and our merchandising programs certainly anticipated that. We've worked with retailers to plan for such events, and we've seen particularly strong pull. The good news is we're seeing quite a bit of that translate into a share and category growth. So that obviously makes us feel good about the prospects going forward. We feel good about our start into Q4 on the business. I will say that Charcoal is more difficult to plan. A lot of it does depend on weather, and we'll have to see it playing out, but we are certainly very optimistic about how we're executing what we can control, and the early success we've had this fiscal year behind merchandising programs again all planned and consistent with the strategy that we've had on the business for a while."

Keep in mind the Professional Products business, which has been growing fabulously for us, you really don't have any advertising spends in there. So you have to be careful with that number. International, I think as we've talked for quite some time, we have been making cuts in advertising. Back when we were in Venezuela, we had basically turned off the advertising. We're spending very little, if any, advertising in Argentina in some of these markets that have price controls. So we've systematically gone into those markets that are margin challenged and have some issues, and we are really pulling back on the advertising. By contrast, we've been putting it in the U.S., which is why we've been quoting I think for the last few quarters what we're spending in our U.S. Retail business.

We exited the Auto business because we didn't like the trends of things like STP. We didn't think it was right for us as a company. Of course, we more recently exited Venezuela as a way of adjusting the portfolio. I think like other companies, we do have small brands that are probably trapped in the portfolio. We're always looking at that to find out if we're the highest value owner. Keep in mind though many of those businesses have been in the portfolio for decades. As a result, they have virtually no tax base. So sometimes, it's better to manage the business for cash over the long term and use that cash to invest for growth or return it back, give the dividend back to our shareholders than to sell those businesses where you may have substantial tax leakage. Nonetheless, we continue to look at the portfolio on a regular basis."

So with that, I'll start by covering highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and updated financial outlook for fiscal year '15. And finally, Benno will provide his perspective, and then we'll open it up for your questions. Please recognize that all of today's commentary is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. 
Turning to our top line results. In Q3, volume was up 1% and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, with the largest impact coming from Argentina, Canada and Australia. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 5%. 
Our growth reflects higher volume and favorable mix as well as a nearly 3 point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect growth across all U.S. segments and International on a currency-neutral basis. 
In Q3, our U.S. 13-week market shares increased 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter. This is the largest market share increase in the past 4 years and reflects share growth in 6 of our 8 tracked categories. Our third quarter increase reflected strong gains in our Home Care and Laundry businesses, with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Clorox Liquid Bleach leading the way. Brita, Glad, Charcoal and Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter. 
Conversely, we saw market share declines on our Cat Litter business as competitive intensity remained high. To address the challenges in our Litter business, we continue to drive our new Lightweight product along with harder-hitting advertising and packaging claims on our overall Fresh Step business.  In addition, we have innovation coming out in the Cat Litter category that we anticipate will result in improved share trends in calendar year 2016. 
Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up 2 points in the third quarter, a strong improvement following the 0.5 point gain we saw in Q1 and more than 1 point gain that we saw in Q2. We are continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains the top priority. 
With that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 1% primarily due to strong results in our Home Care business. Sales also grew 1%, with gains across all Cleaning segment businesses. 
In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased 1% behind strong execution of merchandising events, particularly for Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, along with strong performance of new wipes with micro scrubbers that we began shipping at the start of the fiscal year. While it's too early to get a definitive read on performance, sales also benefited from the launch of 3 new products: Clorox ScrubSingles, Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes and Clorox Pump 'N Clean. 
Our Professional Products business grew sales 3% in the third quarter, particularly behind increased shipments in our food service channel. As we discussed last quarter, following double-digit Q2 sales growth behind Ebola and enterovirus concerns, we anticipated some slowdown in third quarter Professional Products growth as those concerns abated. Looking ahead, we anticipate our Professional Products business will continue to grow faster than the company average. 
In our Laundry business, sales increased 1% due to growth in Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster. As noted last quarter, due to increased input costs, we implemented a 7% average price increase on Clorox Bleach effective February 1. The price increase was well executed in the market, however, competitors have been somewhat slow to follow. From a market share standpoint, our strong execution is paying off as Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. 
In our Household segment, volume was flat while sales increased 5%. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal businesses, which grew volume and sales at a double-digit rate on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. Charcoal's strong top line results were driven by converting to a new and improved Lightweight product that began shipping in January, supported by increased demand-building investments as well as strong early-season performance at key retailers. 
Our Bags & Wraps business grew sales 1%, driven by innovation behind the new Gain-scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Volume on Glad declined 9%, reflecting the impact of price increases taken last March and November on our trash bag business. Although competition has not yet followed, we continue to believe our pricing actions are right for the long term, with signs the resin market is firming up. In addition, we anticipate reinvesting a portion of our pricing benefit in trade spending to manage price gaps and to invest in innovation on our premium lines of business. 
Cat Litter volume and sales decreased 3% and 2%, respectively, in the face of competitive activity. We're continuing to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent pumping and odor control such as with Fresh Step's ""eliminate odor for 10 days"" claim that comes with a money-back guarantee. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 2% while sales grew 3%. These results were driven by high single-digit sales growth on Burt's Bees largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new Lip Crayons grew strongly in the quarter, supported by new Burt's Bees television advertising as did our Renewal face line, facial towelettes and skin brightening products. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, sales growth will likely be lower than year ago as we lap the strong merchandising and pipeline build for the Lip Crayon products. Full year results for Burt's Bees continue to track to high single-digit growth, and we look forward to another strong year in fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our Food business. Volume grew 1% and sales grew 2% versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume of bottled and dry Hidden Valley products, including the February launch of 5 new flavored Hidden Valley Ranch dressings and 2 new Greek yogurt drip -- dry dip and dressing mixes. Partially offsetting the Burt's Bees and Food gains were lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products due to category softness and intense competition in pour-through filters. 
As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters, and it's getting strong reviews in e-commerce channels. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. We're keenly focused on getting our consumer messaging right, and coupled with our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will improve in fiscal year 2016. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 1% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 10%. In the quarter, International saw market share gains in Canada in local currency terms, and we grew volume share in Latin America, particularly in bleach and cleaners. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to see economic -- slowing economic growth in some of our key markets, such as Chile and Peru, given macroeconomic trends such as high inflation and slow GDP growth. That said, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets as we continue to carefully assess spending across geographies and implement price increases to partially mitigate the macroeconomic headwinds. 
Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, as noted in this morning's press release, we've increased our sales growth outlook for the year to be in a range of 1% to 2%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength seen year-to-date. For the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares as well as to defend against reduced prices by competitors. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015."
89450,290174879,801173,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 01, 2015",2015-05-01,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter following a solid first half of fiscal 2015.

We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter following a solid first half of fiscal 2015. As you saw in our press release, given our results today, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and updated earnings per share from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of pricing, a little over 1 point of favorable mix and assortment and nearly 1 point of volume growth. These factors were partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 point of higher trade spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points to 43.2%, reflecting 170 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of increased manufacturing and logistics costs and about 60 basis points of higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. For the quarter, commodity costs were about flat. 
Selling and administrative expenses increased 16% in the third quarter to 14.7% of sales compared to 13% of sales in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by significantly higher performance-based compensation costs, reflecting higher anticipated year-over-year payouts, which recognizes the company's strong performance to date. While the largest impact from higher incentive compensation costs was reflected in selling and administrative expenses, it also resulted in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. Importantly, for the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate the selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, consistent with our long-term target. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was nearly 9% of sales, with U.S. spending for the quarter at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. businesses. 
Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, a $0.06 decrease versus the year-ago quarter due largely to the higher year-over-year incentive compensation costs. As a reminder, in the year-ago period, earnings had a $0.12 benefit due to unusually low incentive compensation costs, again, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $398 million compared with $357 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. In keeping with our practice to return excess cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, fiscal year-to-date, the company has repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $158 million. 
Now I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2015. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook, which now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting stronger results to date and an impact of more than 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currencies. Our sales outlook also reflects slowing international economies, increased trade spending as we continue to support our brands. 
Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. We also continue to anticipate that commodity costs will be about flat for the full year as year-to-date headwinds should be offset by lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, reflecting moderate gross margin expansion, offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. Our fiscal year EBIT margin also reflects incremental demand-building investments. We continue to anticipate fiscal 2015 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we have updated our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.45 to $4.55. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we're going to be keenly focused on 3 things. First, headwinds in international markets, including slowing economies and foreign currency declines, which we anticipate to be higher than this year's expected level of more than 2% and will impact both top and bottom line results. In particular, we anticipate a meaningful currency devaluation in Argentina sometime in fiscal year 2016. Second, we continue to monitor changes in commodity costs. Despite the current softness in resin prices, we're seeing early signs that the market may be firming up. In addition, logistics costs remain high, which will likely continue into next year. And third, we will invest heavily in our brands. As I mentioned previously, historically, we've invested a portion of the resin-related savings back into the business. In particular, we anticipate continuing to invest in trade promotion, especially in categories where competitors have yet to follow our pricing actions. As a reminder, we will provide our outlook for fiscal year 2016 in early August. 
In closing, I feel really good about our results this quarter despite the headwinds we continue to face. We continue to be encouraged by the actions we're taking to accelerate growth in our U.S. businesses and plan to continue investing. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies that allowed us to expand our margins, which supports our focus on driving profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As we've shared with you, the central aspect of our 2020 Strategy is to drive profitable growth. And consistent with that strategy, while facing significant foreign exchange headwinds and cost increases, in Q3 we focused on growing profitably through strong execution of our Desire, Decide and Delight demand-building model based on delivering better value to consumers through launching meaningful innovations across many categories, increasing brand investments in the U.S., delivering strong cost savings and executing price increases where they're justified. 
As a result, we drove category and overall market share improvements and saw further revitalization of our U.S. Retail business. We generated stronger top line results. We expanded gross margin, and we raised our sales outlook and updated our EPS outlook for the fiscal year. 
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, I remain confident in our strategy and our keen focus on accelerating profitable growth to create value for our stockholders. The strategy accelerators I shared with you last quarter are driving decisions around where we will invest more heavily, again, with the intent to drive profitable growth. 
By accelerating portfolio momentum, we're taking advantage of tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and invest more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. We're pleased to see this reflected in our Q3 share growth, which was the strongest we've seen in 4 years. 
By accelerating 3D technology transformation, we're addressing the shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them. As we focus on winning the battle for the physical and virtual shopping cart, we've solidified partnerships with key retailer partners to accelerate our e-commerce strategy. 
By accelerating innovation across our demand-creation model of Desire, Decide and Delight, we are driving category growth. I'm pleased with the progress we're making, and this quarter, we launched meaningful innovation across several categories. Although early days, several of these are exceeding expectations. 
And finally, by accelerating our growth culture while maintaining operational excellence, we're driving an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I believe these are the right strategies, particularly as we manage our business in the face of challenges that Steve Robb noted earlier: slowing economies in international markets and strong foreign exchange headwinds, a volatile commodity market and the need to continue to invest in trade promotions to support our brands against competition. 
And with that, we'll open it up to your questions."

I'm not sure how you define moderate expansion. But if I take your full year guidance of 1% to 2% in the top line and assume, just as a starting point, Q4 gross margin looks like Q3 in terms of expansion, that's going to put your gross margin performance for the year up about 40 basis points, if my math is correct. So I guess first, is 40 basis points lineup as moderate for you? And then second, is there any reason why gross margin expansion shouldn't actually accelerate in Q4 given the magnitude of the presumed commodity benefits and the continued cost saves? I know you flagged the higher trade promotion in your outlook a couple of times, and I'm assuming that's particularly focused on Glad, where you've got the price gap issue. But just how significant a spike in gross-to-net are you expecting in Q4? If you can size that order of magnitude versus Q3."

We are expecting a meaningful improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we're very pleased with the results we saw in the third quarter, where we added almost a little over a full point of gross margin. And what we saw in the third quarter, and this is relevant to the fourth quarter, strong cost savings programs, pricing actions that are working in the market. In the third quarter, commodity costs were flat, and so all those benefits flowed through. When you look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel great about the pricing. We feel very good about the cost savings, and importantly, we expect to get some commodity cost tailwinds, okay? And that will probably be the first quarter this year where we're actually getting tailwinds, so I would expect meaningful gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Now for the full year, stepping back, we do expect EBIT margin to be about flat. And the reason for that is we are going to continue to step up our investments in consumer demand-building investments, and our SG&A costs are expected to be about 14% for the full year. So I think some of the benefit in the fourth quarter in gross margin will be offset by some of these other factors, but nonetheless, you should see some pretty nice numbers."

You've taken a lot of [indiscernible] in recent years to try to improve the profitability, walking away from Venezuela, the SAP investment. Yet looking at profitability, I think, from a margin perspective, this quarter marks a new all-time low. So can you talk more -- I know FX is a pressure point here, but from just a profitability perspective, what's driving the ongoing erosion? What can you do to maybe fix it? And what's a realistic expectation as we think about the forward there?"

Well, our aspiration, long-term aspiration in International is to grow 5% to 7% in sales but importantly, grow profitably. And it's fair to say that at this point, we're not meeting those expectations. I would say that operationally, we're executing well, but we all know this is a very challenging environment that will likely continue well into next fiscal year. The key drivers to your question, a lot of them are macroeconomic in nature, around GDP, around cost inflation, price controls and FX. Again, these are factors that our peers are seeing as well, and they're pretty well established. Going forward, our focus will be on rebuilding margin. I'm not happy about the profitability, and rebuilding margin is our first priority. And I would point out a few key tactics: one, continue pricing to offset inflation; two, innovation where margin-accretive that drives trade up. And we're seeing good results behind tactics like this in markets like Argentina, and there's more that we can and will do. Three, we will really be very disciplined about demand spending. We will spend where it is profitable and where we feel like there's going to be a long-term growth effect. We will not spend if the profitability is not there. And then fourth, we have intensified our efforts to apply what we think is a solid playbook from the U.S. on the cost savings side, and we will do more of that. So going forward, I do not expect us to be on the growth trajectory, the 5% to 7% in sales growth that I mentioned earlier anytime soon. But I do think that we can do better to start rebuilding our margin, and that, again, will be our priority near term given all the challenges that are largely macroeconomic in nature."

It implies sort of down 2% to plus 2% for the fourth quarter. Plus 2% seems like it should be pretty much -- or should be a pretty achievable target. So the question is, why not just go from 1% to 2%? Or is there real risk that your top line is materially weaker than just 2% in the fourth quarter?"

Starting with the latter question, which is regarding the outlook, again, the outlook for sales growth for the full year is 1% to 2% all-in, including foreign currencies. That would be clear. Fiscal year-to-date, we've delivered about 2% sales growth, a little over 2% sales growth all-in. I think as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting sales growth to be probably flat to up slightly. The things that we're monitoring carefully right now, number one, is just foreign currencies. There's a lot of volatility there. Second, our Charcoal business, which, by the way, is off to a great start, certainly, in the third quarter. But it's a seasonal business. It's historically had some volatility, so we'll need to see how that plays out. And then finally, we're going to continue to invest in our business. So I think on balance, it's fair to say, based on what we know, that we're probably in the mid- to upper end of that range, of the 1% to 2%. Turning to your question on International, it is challenging because you've got foreign exchange, which is certainly placing a drag on the margins in our International business because like many companies that have businesses in the emerging markets, you pay for a lot of your costs in dollars, and as a result, you kind of -- you take a double hit on that. We are seeing benefits of lower commodity costs beginning to trickle through to International but probably to a less extent than we're seeing in the U.S. because the inflationary pressures are higher in the International markets. And where possible, we try to source materials locally and try to pay in local currency. So I think the margin challenges in International are a bit more acute. And I think as Benno said, that's why we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to lean into pricing. We're going to continue to drive hard against our cost savings. We're going to get smart about how we allocate our investment spend, and then finally, I think there is more opportunity to lower SG&A costs globally but particularly in International, and you'll see us focus on that as well."

What we've seen, and this is not unique to Clorox, as we've talked many times before, there's 2 fundamental problems in logistics that everybody's facing. Simply not enough drivers and trucks. Part of that is changing rules and regulations. Part of it's probably a fallout from the economic slowdown. A lot of trucking companies went out of businesses, and there's just not enough trucks on the road. And rail has been somewhat congested. And so that's been driving up overall logistics costs. I think this area may be impacting Clorox a bit more, though, than other companies because some of our plants are in more rural locations. We have longer shipping lanes. And we also tend to ship things like bleach and charcoal and cat litter, which weigh a bit more, and so you pay a bit more there. So it's an ongoing pressure. It's something that we fully expect will continue through next year, which is why, again, we're focusing on pricing and cost savings to address it. In terms of the outlook for commodity costs, again, as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate commodity costs to be about flat on the year, but we do expect to get some tailwinds in the fourth quarter. What we're watching very carefully right now is energy prices. Energy prices, over the last 4 to 8 weeks, have moved up pretty sharply. And one of the things we know over time is that commodity costs tend to come down slowly, but they move up pretty quickly. And so resin prices appear to have found the bottom. They're starting to firm up. I do expect that in the fourth quarter, there'll be some tailwinds, and there might be some tailwinds going into early fiscal '16, but we're just giving a sharp eye on this because these markets have a tendency to swing pretty quickly. But we'll have a better update for you in early August, when we provide our outlook for fiscal '16."

And on the competitive side, I would say at this point, it's early days, and we need to let this play out. Some accounts did follow on the private label side, some not yet. So it's not clear where this will end up. I would offer a few pieces of perspective. First of all, the price increases continue to be cost-justified. Our competitors see the same cost increases that we do. So again, early days. We need to let this play out. We do have a strong track record, obviously taking price increases over the long term. We know how to execute pricing, and we're certainly committed to growing our categories profitably. We had anticipated the need to spend some of the pricing benefit back in trade promotion. This is exactly what's happening. This is exactly what is reflected in our outlook. So we are staying the course on pricing on bleach and also on Glad for that matter, but we'll also stay agile if needed. So if we need to course-correct down the road, we will. But at this point, my expectation is that this price increase will be executed successfully. We'll probably see, also as a disclaimer, volumes and shares over a few quarters be somewhat depressed. Again, that's a normal thing. And after 3 to 4 quarters, once consumers are used to new price points, we should see that ease up and normalize. But overall, I would say the price increases are on track."

Brita has been soft recently, and certainly, on the share side, we're seeing some improvement. It's, to be honest, early, too early to say that we've turned the corner, but I'm certainly feeling better. The issue on Brita has been private label filter distribution expansion, which led our share and volume to be under pressure and also has led the category to be -- to a decline. We are focused on innovation, innovation on systems but also innovation on filters to differentiate from private label. That work is underway, and we're seeing good progress. We're also working with retailers to reverse the trade-downs in the category and revitalize the category, and I expect better results in fiscal year 2016. The good news is on Brita, that our pour-through systems, which is the majority of the business, is growing, and that's typically a precursor to higher filter sales. So that's a green shoot, and I think Brita will see growth in the next fiscal year, and I'm quite optimistic. Litter, obviously, no surprise, not yet where we want it to be. What we've always said is that it will take a few quarters until we can expect improvements, and I will say that I think that it will take until fiscal year 2016 also. We're focused on earning share and not buying share, which ultimately requires better innovation. We've put a few things in place that are beginning to take hold. We're investing in better value communication. Lightweight litter, which we've launched earlier this fiscal year, has been quite successful, and we're investing behind it. And as Steve Austenfeld said earlier in the call, we have strong innovation coming out in the next fiscal year, which is ultimately what it will take. So pleased with the progress. I'd also offer as a perspective that Litter is growing both volume and sales fiscal year-to-date. So that share number is certainly the one number that I don't like and no one here at Clorox likes. But to put it in perspective, we're nevertheless growing, and we feel good about our prospects for 2016 and beyond."

So there's still a net benefit. We are committed to growing these categories profitably. As I said earlier, these price increases are cost-justified. And typically, what happens, and this time is no exception, that we have to invest back temporarily. In the long run, I would assume, as has happened in the past, that the trade spend will subside over time and will normalize. But as we are helping consumers adjust to new price points, as we support our brand against competition temporarily, again, as was the case in the past, we will invest back for a net benefit for pricing."

And it really looks like the European companies are putting significant amount of pressure on this marketplace already based on the currency benefits. So do you feel that this a little bit of a dangerous situation to be in relative to Europe, relative to what the commodities are doing? Or do you still feel like you would do it all over again, knowing what you know now in the pricing?"

And the subject categories, bleach, Glad are growing share very nicely. Bleach now, we've grown share for the fifth quarter in a row. And in fact, what we're also seeing is that the momentum that we have seen over the past years from private label share has become much more modest at this point, and we're today growing, in fact, in dollar terms, faster than private label. I would also say that, look, at the end of the day, this temporarily higher spend on trade is just one component of what we are doing. I would ask that we also consider that we're investing very strongly in innovation. A lot of our trade spend today goes against fast distribution and innovation. We're seeing several innovations off to a fast start. On the distribution front, we're pleased with the progress on the Cleaning innovation. Glad with Gain is off to a very strong start as is lightweight coal. The new Hidden Valley Ranch flavors with cucumber, avocado and sweet chili are doing nicely. So I would look at it in context of our stated desire to invest in accelerating growth but investing to accelerate growth profitably. And I feel like Q3 is a good example of that, and there's more to come on that front."

So first, what's behind this is -- we've been on a strategy in Charcoal to encourage year-round merchandising for a while, and that's certainly been very successful. We've seen particularly strong success this year. If you think about what's happened in much of the country weather-wise, there was pent-up demand, and there was readiness also by retailers to invest in Charcoal, to get people back into the stores and encourage store traffic, and our merchandising programs certainly anticipated that. We've worked with retailers to plan for such events, and we've seen particularly strong pull. The good news is we're seeing quite a bit of that translate into share and category growth. So that obviously makes us feel good about the prospects going forward. We feel good about our start into Q4 on the business. I will say that Charcoal is more difficult to plan. A lot of it does depend on weather, and we'll have to see it play out. But we are certainly very optimistic about how we're executing what we can control, and the early success we've had this fiscal year behind merchandising programs, again, all planned and consistent with the strategy that we've had on the business for a while."

So what you've seen us do is shift more spending into the U.S. Retail business. Keep in mind the Professional Products business, which has been growing fabulously for us, we really don't have any advertising expense in there, so you have to be careful with that number. International, I think as we've talked for quite some time, we have been making cuts in advertising. Back when we were in Venezuela, we had basically turned off the advertising. We're spending very little, if any, advertising in Argentina in some of these markets that have price controls. So we've systematically gone into those markets that are margin-challenged and have some issues, and we're really pulling back on the advertising. By contrast, we've been putting it in the U.S., which is why we've been quoting, I think, for the last few quarters what we're spending in our U.S. Retail business. So we feel good about the total demand-building investment. We feel good how it's building market share for us. And certainly, it's driving top line momentum in the U.S. business, and I think you can see that in the numbers."

As a result, they have virtually no tax base.

Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So with that, I'll start by covering highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and updated financial outlook for fiscal year '15. And finally, Benno will provide his perspective, and then we'll open it up for your questions. Please recognize that all of today's commentary is on a continuing-operations basis unless otherwise stated. 
Turning to our top line results. In Q3, volume was up 1% and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, with the largest impact coming from Argentina, Canada and Australia. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 5%. 
Our growth reflects higher volume and favorable mix as well as a nearly 3-point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect growth across all U.S. segments and International on a currency-neutral basis. 
In Q3, our U.S. 13-week market shares increased 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter. This is the largest market share increase in the past 4 years and reflects share growth in 6 of our 8 tracked categories. Our third quarter increase reflected strong gains in our Home Care and Laundry businesses, with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Clorox Liquid Bleach leading the way. Brita, Glad, Charcoal and Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter. 
Conversely, we saw market share declines on our Cat Litter business, as competitive intensity remained high. To address the challenges in our Litter business, we continue to drive our new Lightweight product along with harder-hitting advertising and packaging claims on our overall Fresh Step business.  In addition, we have innovation coming out in the Cat Litter category that we anticipate will result in improved share trends in calendar year 2016. 
Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up 2 points in the third quarter, a strong improvement following the 0.5-point gain we saw in Q1 and more than 1-point gain that we saw in Q2. We are continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains the top priority. 
With that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 1%, primarily due to strong results in our Home Care business. Sales also grew 1%, with gains across all Cleaning segment businesses. 
In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased 1% behind strong execution of merchandising events, particularly for Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, along with strong performance of new wipes with micro scrubbers that we began shipping at the start of the fiscal year. While it's too early to get a definitive read on performance, sales also benefited from the launch of 3 new products: Clorox ScrubSingles, Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes and Clorox Pump 'N Clean. 
Our Professional Products business grew sales 3% in the third quarter, particularly behind increased shipments in our food service channel. As we discussed last quarter, following double-digit Q2 sales growth behind Ebola and enterovirus concerns, we anticipated some slowdown in third quarter Professional Products growth as those concerns abated. Looking ahead, we anticipate our Professional Products business will continue to grow faster than the company average. 
In our Laundry business, sales increased 1% due to growth in Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster. As noted last quarter, due to increased input costs, we implemented a 7% average price increase on Clorox Bleach effective February 1. The price increase was well executed in the market, however, competitors have been somewhat slow to follow. From a market share standpoint, our strong execution is paying off as Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. 
In our Household segment, volume was flat while sales increased 5%. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal businesses, which grew volume and sales at a double-digit rate on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. Charcoal's strong top line results were driven by converting to a new and improved lightweight product that began shipping in January, supported by increased demand-building investments as well as strong early-season performance at key retailers. 
Our Bags & Wraps business grew sales 1%, driven by innovation behind the new Gain-scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Volume on Glad declined 9%, reflecting the impact of price increases taken last March and November on our trash bag business. Although competition has not yet followed, we continue to believe our pricing actions are right for the long term, with signs the resin market is firming up. In addition, we anticipate reinvesting a portion of our pricing benefit in trade spending to manage price gaps and to invest in innovation on our premium lines of business. 
Cat Litter volume and sales decreased 3% and 2%, respectively, in the face of competitive activity. We're continuing to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control, such as with Fresh Step's ""eliminate odor for 10 days"" claim that comes with a money-back guarantee. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 2% while sales grew 3%. These results were driven by high single-digit sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new Lip Crayons grew strongly in the quarter, supported by new Burt's Bees television advertising, as did our Renewal face line, facial towelettes and skin-brightening products. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, sales growth will likely be lower than year-ago as we lap the strong merchandising and pipeline build for the Lip Crayon products. Full year results for Burt's Bees continue to track to high single-digit growth, and we look forward to another strong year in fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our Food business. Volume grew 1% and sales grew 2% versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume of bottled and dry Hidden Valley products, including the February launch of 5 new flavored Hidden Valley Ranch dressings and 2 new Greek yogurt drip -- dry dip and dressing mixes. Partially offsetting the Burt's Bees and Food gains were lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products due to category softness and intense competition in pour-through filters. 
As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters, and it's getting strong reviews in e-commerce channels. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. We're keenly focused on getting our consumer messaging right, and coupled with our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will improve in fiscal year 2016. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 1% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 10%. In the quarter, International saw market share gains in Canada in local currency terms, and we grew volume share in Latin America, particularly in bleach and cleaners. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to see economic -- slowing economic growth in some of our key markets, such as Chile and Peru, given macroeconomic trends such as high inflation and slow GDP growth. That said, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets as we continue to carefully assess spending across geographies and implement price increases to partially mitigate the macroeconomic headwinds. 
Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015. As noted in this morning's press release, we've increased our sales growth outlook for the year to be in a range of 1% to 2%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength seen year-to-date. For the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares, as well as to defend against reduced prices by competitors. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015."

We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter following a solid first half of fiscal 2015.

We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter following a solid first half of fiscal 2015. As you saw in our press release, given our results to date, we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and updated earnings per share from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of pricing, a little over 1 point of favorable mix and assortment and nearly 1 point of volume growth. These factors were partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 point of higher trade spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points to 43.2%, reflecting 170 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of increased manufacturing and logistics costs and about 60 basis points of higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. For the quarter, commodity costs were about flat. 
Selling and administrative expenses increased 16% in the third quarter to 14.7% of sales compared to 13% of sales in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by significantly higher performance-based compensation costs, reflecting higher anticipated year-over-year payouts, which recognizes the company's strong performance to date. While the largest impact from higher incentive compensation costs was reflected in selling and administrative expenses, it also resulted in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. Importantly, for the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate the selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, consistent with our long-term target. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was nearly 9% of sales, with U.S. spending for the quarter at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. businesses. 
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, a $0.06 decrease versus the year-ago quarter, due largely to the higher year-over-year incentive compensation costs. As a reminder, in the year-ago period, earnings had a $0.12 benefit due to unusually low incentive compensation costs, again, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $398 million compared with $357 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. In keeping with our practice to return excess cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, fiscal year-to-date, the company has repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $158 million. 
Now I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2015. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook, which now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting stronger results to date and an impact of more than 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currencies. Our sales outlook also reflects slowing international economies and increased trade spending as we continue to support our brands. 
Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year, as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. We also continue to anticipate that commodity costs will be about flat for the full year, as year-to-date headwinds should be offset by lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, reflecting moderate gross margin expansion, offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. Our fiscal year EBIT margin also reflects incremental demand-building investments. We continue to anticipate fiscal 2015 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we have updated our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.45 to $4.55. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we're going to be keenly focused on 3 things. First, headwinds in international markets, including slowing economies and foreign currency declines, which we anticipate to be higher than this year's expected level of more than 2% and will impact both top and bottom line results. In particular, we anticipate a meaningful currency devaluation in Argentina sometime in fiscal year 2016. Second, we continue to monitor changes in commodity costs. Despite the current softness in resin prices, we're seeing early signs that the market may be firming up. In addition, logistics costs remain high, which will likely continue into next year. And third, we will invest heavily in our brands. As I mentioned previously, historically, we've invested a portion of the resin-related savings back into the business. In particular, we anticipate continuing to invest in trade promotion, especially in categories where competitors have yet to follow our pricing actions. As a reminder, we will provide our outlook for fiscal year 2016 in early August. 
In closing, I feel really good about our results this quarter despite the headwinds we continue to face. We continue to be encouraged by the actions we're taking to accelerate growth in our U.S. businesses and plan to continue investing. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies that allowed us to expand our margins, which supports our focus on driving profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As we've shared with you, the central aspect of our 2020 Strategy is to drive profitable growth. And consistent with that strategy, while facing significant foreign exchange headwinds and cost increases, in Q3 we focused on growing profitably through strong execution of our Desire, Decide and Delight demand-building model based on delivering better value to consumers; through launching meaningful innovations across many categories; increasing brand investments in the U.S.; delivering strong cost savings; and executing price increases where they're justified. 
As a result, we drove category and overall market share improvements and saw further revitalization of our U.S. Retail business. We generated stronger top line results. We expanded gross margin, and we raised our sales outlook and updated our EPS outlook for the fiscal year. 
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, I remain confident in our strategy and our keen focus on accelerating profitable growth to create value for our stockholders. The strategy accelerators I shared with you last quarter are driving decisions around where we will invest more heavily, again, with the intent to drive profitable growth. 
By accelerating portfolio momentum, we're taking advantage of tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and invest more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. We're pleased to see this reflected in our Q3 share growth, which was the strongest we've seen in 4 years. 
By accelerating 3D technology transformation, we're addressing the shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them. As we focus on winning the battle for the physical and virtual shopping carts, we've solidified partnerships with key retailer partners to accelerate our e-commerce strategy. 
By accelerating innovation across our demand-creation model of Desire, Decide and Delight, we are driving category growth. I'm pleased with the progress we're making, and this quarter, we launched meaningful innovation across several categories. Although early days, several of these are exceeding expectations. 
And finally, by accelerating our growth culture while maintaining operational excellence, we're driving an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I believe these are the right strategies, particularly as we manage our business in the face of challenges that Steve Robb noted earlier: slowing economies in international markets and strong foreign exchange headwinds, a volatile commodity market and the need to continue to invest in trade promotions to support our brands against competition. 
And with that, we'll open it up to your questions."

I'm not sure how you define moderate expansion. But if I take your full year guidance of 1% to 2% in the top line and assume, just as a starting point, Q4 gross margin looks like Q3 in terms of expansion, that's going to put your gross margin performance for the year up about 40 basis points, if my math is correct. So I guess first, does 40 basis points line-up as moderate for you? And then second, is there any reason why gross margin expansion shouldn't actually accelerate in Q4, given the magnitude of the presumed commodity benefits and the continued cost saves? I know you flagged the higher trade promotion in your outlook a couple of times, and I'm assuming that's particularly focused on Glad, where you've got the price gap issue. But just how significant a spike in gross-to-net are you expecting in Q4? If you can size that order of magnitude versus Q3."

We are expecting a meaningful improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we're very pleased with the results we saw in the third quarter, where we added almost a little over a full point of gross margin. And what we saw in the third quarter, and this is relevant to the fourth quarter, strong cost savings programs, pricing actions that are working in the market. In the third quarter, commodity costs were flat, and so all those benefits flowed through. When you look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel great about the pricing. We feel very good about the cost savings, and importantly, we expect to get some commodity cost tailwinds, okay? And that will probably be the first quarter this year where we're actually getting tailwinds, so I would expect meaningful gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Now for the full year, stepping back, we do expect EBIT margin to be about flat. And the reason for that is we are going to continue to step up our investments in consumer demand-building investments, and our SG&A costs are expected to be about 14% for the full year. So I think some of the benefit in the fourth quarter in gross margin will be offset by some of these other factors, but nonetheless, you should see some pretty nice numbers."

So I think what you should expect is a mix of both trade spending, as we're looking to drive trial and repeat on new products, as well as just advertising as we keep those brands healthy.

I would say that operationally, we're executing well, but we all know this is a very challenging environment that will likely continue well into next fiscal year. The key drivers, to your question, a lot of them are macroeconomic in nature, around GDP, around cost inflation, price controls and FX. Again, these are factors that our peers are seeing as well, and they're pretty well established. Going forward, our focus will be on rebuilding margin. I'm not happy about the profitability, and rebuilding margin is our first priority. And I would point out a few key tactics: one, continue pricing to offset inflation; two, innovation where margin-accretive, that drives trade up. And we're seeing good results behind tactics like this in markets like Argentina, and there's more that we can and will do. Three, we will really be very disciplined about demand spending. We will spend where it is profitable and where we feel like there's going to be a long-term growth effect. We will not spend if the profitability is not there. And then fourth, we have intensified our efforts to apply what we think is a solid playbook from the U.S. on the cost savings side, and we will do more of that. So going forward, I do not expect us to be on the growth trajectory, the 5% to 7% in sales growth that I mentioned earlier, anytime soon. But I do think that we can do better to start rebuilding our margin, and that, again, will be our priority near term, given all the challenges that are largely macroeconomic in nature."

It implies sort of down 2% to plus 2% for the fourth quarter. Plus 2% seems like it should be pretty much -- or should be a pretty achievable target. So the question is, why not just go from 1% to 2%? Or is there real risk that your top line is materially weaker than just 2% in the fourth quarter?"

Starting with the latter question, which is regarding the outlook, again, the outlook for sales growth for the full year is 1% to 2% all-in, including foreign currencies. That would be clear. Fiscal year-to-date, we've delivered about 2% sales growth, a little over 2% sales growth all-in. I think as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting sales growth to be probably flat to up slightly. The things that we're monitoring carefully right now, number one, is just foreign currencies. There's a lot of volatility there. Second, our Charcoal business, which, by the way, is off to a great start, certainly, in the third quarter. But it's a seasonal business. It's historically had some volatility, so we'll need to see how that plays out. And then finally, we're going to continue to invest in our business. So I think on balance, it's fair to say, based on what we know, that we're probably in the mid to upper end of that range, of the 1% to 2%. Turning to your question on International, it is challenging because you've got foreign exchange, which is certainly placing a drag on the margins in our International business because, like many companies that have businesses in the emerging markets, you pay for a lot of your costs in dollars, and as a result, you kind of -- you take a double hit on that. We are seeing benefits of lower commodity costs beginning to trickle through to International, but probably to a less extent than we're seeing in the U.S. because the inflationary pressures are higher in the International markets. And where possible, we try to source materials locally and try to pay in local currency. So I think the margin challenges in International are a bit more acute. And I think as Benno said, that's why we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to lean into pricing. We're going to continue to drive hard against our cost savings.

What we've seen, and this is not unique to Clorox, as we've talked many times before, there's 2 fundamental problems in logistics that everybody's facing. There's simply not enough drivers and trucks. Part of that is changing rules and regulations. Part of it's probably a fallout from the economic slowdown. A lot of trucking companies went out of businesses, and there's just not enough trucks on the road. And rail has been somewhat congested. And so that's been driving up overall logistics costs. I think this area may be impacting Clorox a bit more, though, than other companies because some of our plants are in more rural locations, where you have longer shipping lanes. And we also tend to ship things like bleach and charcoal and cat litter, which weigh a bit more, and so you pay a bit more there. So it's an ongoing pressure. It's something that we fully expect will continue through next year, which is why, again, we're focusing on pricing and cost savings to address it. In terms of the outlook for commodity costs, again, as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate commodity costs to be about flat on the year, but we do expect to get some tailwinds in the fourth quarter. What we're watching very carefully right now is energy prices. Energy prices, over the last 4 to 8 weeks, have moved up pretty sharply. And one of the things we know over time is that commodity costs tend to come down slowly, but they move up pretty quickly. And so resin prices appear to have found the bottom. They're starting to firm up. I do expect that in the fourth quarter, there'll be some tailwinds, and there might be some tailwinds going into early fiscal '16, but we're just keeping a sharp eye on this because these markets have a tendency to swing pretty quickly. But we'll have a better update for you in early August, when we provide our outlook for fiscal '16."

And on the competitive side, I would say at this point, it's early days, and we need to let this play out. Some accounts did follow on the private-label side, some not yet. So it's not clear where this will end up. I would offer a few pieces of perspective. First of all, the price increases continue to be cost-justified. Our competitors see the same cost increases that we do. So again, early days. We need to let this play out. We do have a strong track record, obviously, taking price increases over the long term. We know how to execute pricing, and we're certainly committed to growing our categories profitably. We had anticipated the need to spend some of the pricing benefit back in trade promotion. This is exactly what's happening. This is exactly what is reflected in our outlook. So we are staying the course on pricing on bleach, and also on Glad for that matter, but we'll also stay agile if needed. So if we need to course-correct down the road, we will. But at this point, my expectation is that this price increase will be executed successfully. We'll probably see, also as a disclaimer, volumes and shares over a few quarters be somewhat depressed. Again, that's a normal thing. And after 3 to 4 quarters, once consumers are used to new price points, we should see that ease up and normalize. But overall, I would say the price increases are on track."

Brita has been soft recently, and certainly, on the share side, we're seeing some improvement. It's, to be honest, early, too early to say that we've turned the corner, but I'm certainly feeling better. The issue on Brita has been private-label filter distribution expansion, which led our share and volume to be under pressure and also has led the category to be -- to a decline. We are focused on innovation, innovation on systems but also innovation on filters to differentiate from private label. That work is underway, and we're seeing good progress. We're also working with retailers to reverse the trade-downs in the category and revitalize the category, and I expect better results in fiscal year 2016. The good news is on Brita, that our pour-through systems, which is the majority of the business, is growing, and that's typically a precursor to higher filter sales. So that's a green shoot, and I think Brita will see growth in the next fiscal year, and I'm quite optimistic. Litter, obviously, no surprise, not yet where we want it to be. What we've always said is that it will take a few quarters until we can expect improvements, and I will say that I think that it will take until fiscal year 2016 also. We're focused on earning share and not buying share, which ultimately requires better innovation. We've put a few things in place that are beginning to take hold. We're investing in better value communication. Lightweight litter, which we've launched earlier this fiscal year, has been quite successful, and we're investing behind it. And as Steve Austenfeld said earlier in the call, we have strong innovation coming up in the next fiscal year, which is ultimately what it will take. So pleased with the progress. I'd also offer as a perspective that Litter is growing both volume and sales fiscal year-to-date. So that share number is certainly the one number that I don't like and no one here at Clorox likes. But to put it in perspective, we're nevertheless growing, and we feel good about our prospects for 2016 and beyond."

And I guess what's your visibility in terms of whether that higher level of merchandising is going to be continuing over the course of the summer selling season?"

So first, what's behind this is -- we've been on a strategy in Charcoal to encourage year-round merchandising for a while, and that's certainly been very successful.

So first, what's behind this is -- we've been on a strategy in Charcoal to encourage year-round merchandising for a while, and that's certainly been very successful. We've seen particularly strong success this year. If you think about what's happened in much of the country weather-wise, there was pent-up demand, and there was readiness also by retailers to invest in Charcoal, to get people back into the stores and encourage store traffic, and our merchandising programs certainly anticipated that. We've worked with retailers to plan for such events, and we've seen particularly strong pull. The good news is we're seeing quite a bit of that translate into share and category growth. So that obviously makes us feel good about the prospects going forward. We feel good about our start into Q4 on the business. I will say that Charcoal is more difficult to plan. A lot of it does depend on weather, and we'll have to see it play out. But we are certainly very optimistic about how we're executing what we can control, and the early success we've had this fiscal year behind merchandising programs, again, all planned and consistent with the strategy that we've had on the business for a while."

So what you've seen us do is shift more spending into the U.S. Retail business. Keep in mind the Professional Products business, which has been growing fabulously for us, we really don't have any advertising expense in there, so you have to be careful with that number. International, I think as we've talked for quite some time, we have been making cuts in advertising. Back when we were in Venezuela, we had basically turned off the advertising. We're spending very little, if any, advertising in Argentina in some of these markets that have price controls. So we've systematically gone into those markets that are margin-challenged and have some issues, and we're really pulling back on the advertising. By contrast, we've been putting it in the U.S., which is why we've been quoting, I think, for the last few quarters, what we're spending in our U.S. Retail business. So we feel good about the total demand-building investment. We feel good how it's building market share for us.

One thing that we found is that heavy users, in particular, display a lot more usage around cleaning occasions on top of laundry. So we will focus on that part of the business.

We're always looking at that to find out if we're the highest-value owner. Keep in mind, though, many of those businesses have been in the portfolio for decades. As a result, they have virtually no tax base. So sometimes, it's better to manage the business for cash over the long term and use that cash to invest for growth or return it back, through the dividend, back to our shareholders than to sell those businesses where you may have substantial tax leakage.

Turning to our commentary. There are 3 key messages we'd like you to take away from today's call: first, we're very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal year '15 performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth and to do so profitably; second, our base is as healthy as it has been in recent memory, and we're investing behind our business, at the same time, there are a few factors we anticipate will somewhat moderate fiscal year '16 growth in comparison to fiscal year '15; and third, we believe our outlook for fiscal year '16 presents a balanced view that appropriately accounts for current strengths, opportunities and a few challenges. 
With that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.
In Q4, sales grew 4%, driven by volume growth of 3% and the benefit of price increases, partially offset by 2 points of negative foreign currency. All major currencies were down double digits due to the strong U.S. dollar with the Argentinian peso having the greatest impact. 
On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter sales grew 6%. For the fiscal year, volume grew 2% while sales climbed 3%. And on a currency-neutral basis, full year sales increased 5 points, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. behind improving category growth rates and 3 percentage points of growth from innovation as well as growth in International, excluding foreign currency headwinds behind price increases and higher shipments. 
This is the fourth consecutive fiscal year we've delivered 3 points of growth from innovation. Driving improved category trends and market shares has been a top priority for us, and in Q4, our U.S. market shares increased 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter, our largest market share gain in 4 years. 
6 of our 8 business units increased market share versus the year-ago quarter with Laundry, Home Care and Charcoal achieving the greatest gains, and our categories grew 2.8% during the quarter, the strongest rate in several years. 
With that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q4 volume grew 7%, and sales increased 9% with sales up strongly in each business unit. Home Care, our largest Domestic business unit, was supported by double-digit growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, driven by increased investment in demand-building, including high levels of quality merchandising support, highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products. By fiscal year-end, Home Care had achieved 14 consecutive months of market share gains. 
Laundry sales increased mid-single digits, driven by our February 2015 price increase on Clorox Liquid Bleach. And in June, just a few months ago, we introduced Clorox bleach crystals and solid packs. These nonliquid products provide the power of Clorox bleach in a convenient form for consumers with no spilling or splashing. Overall, our bleach share for the quarter was flat with gains on Clorox Splash-less bleach, offset by declines on our regular incentive bleach product. Splash-less bleach is the fastest growing part of the bleach category, and Clorox's share in this Premium segment is 7x that of the combined private-label offerings. 
Finally, strong volume and sales gain on our Professional Products business were driven by higher shipments of our base health care products as well as professional Cleaning and Food products. 
In our Household segment, fourth quarter volume increased 2%, and sales grew 4%, driven by high single-digit volume gains in our Bags and Wraps business. Premium trash bags continue to be a real contributor behind innovation on our OdorShield lineup and new Gain-scented trash bags that had strong early success. These innovations supporting consumers' desire for value-added trash bags as well as price increases taken last calendar year helped drive higher sales and a meaningful market share gain in the quarter. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume increased slightly, driven by our Fresh Step brand while sales and market share declined as a result of continued competitive pressure. We've been investing more aggressively to communicate our excellent clumping and odor control benefit and to bring innovation to market. Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme, launched in August of last year, continues to grow behind its promise to eliminate odor for 10 days and a money back guarantee. 
Our Charcoal business, volume and sales declined slightly following very strong double-digit growth in the prior quarter. Looking into combined quarters, Q3 and Q4 delivered all-time record shipments on Charcoal, and our business realized strong share gains in Q4. That said, we're now lapping another double-digit quarter from a year ago as we anticipate shipping declines in Charcoal in the first quarter of fiscal year '16. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volumes and sales were flat as strong mid-single-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees were offset by slight volume declines in our Brita and Food businesses. Gains in Burt's Bees were driven by the Renewal Face Care line introduced a year ago and ongoing strength in facial towelettes. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 2%, and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Including the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and Cleaning utensils. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '15 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '16."
89450,306142434,846708,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '15 with our Domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%.

We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '15 with our Domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. 
In addition, International delivered strong sales increases on a currency-neutral basis behind higher volume and well-executed price increases to mitigate inflationary pressures. Importantly, the strength of our total company results led to a record year of free cash flow, reflecting solid top line growth and margin expansion in fiscal '15. 
Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our fourth quarter, sales grew 4% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 270 basis points to 45.6%, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2 points to 14.2%, primarily from higher performance-based incentive costs, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. This compares to an unusually low 12.2% of sales in the year-ago period when incentive costs were lower due to the company's results falling below target. 
As a reminder, the largest impact from the higher incentive costs is reflected in selling and administrative expenses, but it's also included in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. 
Advertising investment for the quarter was close to 10% of sales, reflecting support for our domestic brands and categories at nearly 11% of U.S. sales, partially offset by reduced spending in economically challenged International markets. Importantly, we were pleased to see that our brand investments are paying off and strong category growth with increases in 6 out of 8 U.S. categories. 
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44, an 11% increase versus the year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. In addition, the sale of real estate assets by a low-income housing partnership contributed a onetime benefit of about $0.06 to diluted earnings per share. 
Now I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew nearly 3% with volume and pricing each contributing a little more than 2 points, partially offset by more than 2 points of foreign currency declines. 
On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased 90 basis points to 43.6% compared to 42.7% in fiscal year 2014, driven primarily by 140 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 0.5 points to 14.1%, primarily from higher year-over-year incentive costs. Overall, expenses were in line with our expectations for fiscal year '15 and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of sales. 
Advertising spending for the fiscal year was more than 9% of sales with domestic spending at about 10% of U.S. sales. 
For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 34.2% versus 34.6% in the year-ago period. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.57 compared with $4.39 on the year-ago period, an increase of 4%. 
Fiscal year '15 free cash flow was $733 million compared with $649 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, and this is the highest level we've delivered in more than 10 years. 
As we mentioned in the press release, we've repurchased about 4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $434 million in fiscal year '15 to offset stock option dilution. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter. 
At the end of fiscal year '15, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of flat to 1%, which takes into account several factors: first, we feel really good about the progress we're making in our U.S. business. We're also confident in the strength of our innovation program, which we anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth; second, we plan to increase trade promotion spending to support our brands, including managing price gaps following the 2 price increases on Glad trash and bleach taken in the last 18 months; and third, we anticipate fiscal year sales to be negatively impacted by several factors in International, including continued slowing of International economies and about 3 points of foreign currency declines with about half is anticipated from a significant devaluation of Argentina's currency. 
In addition, we plan to reduce our International demand-building investments in economically challenged markets, which will also impact sales growth. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings, pricing and somewhat lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other moderating factors include higher trade spending and foreign currency declines. 
As a reminder, declining foreign currencies negatively impact both our top line results and margins, particularly in markets where we pay for input costs in U.S. dollars. We do anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year '16. We also expect EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting flat gross margins and lower selling and administrative cost. 
We project that our fiscal year '16 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate our fiscal year '16 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83. 
In closing, I feel really good about the strong finish to the fiscal year. Incremental investments behind our brands are paying off in category growth and market share gains across several brands. 
In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies, resulting in another year of strong cost savings allowing us to expand our margins. In fiscal '16, we expect to face continued headwinds, particularly in our International business. However, we've managed through these challenges before, and I'm confident in the plans we have in place, including leaning into our pipeline of cost savings programs. Importantly, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to invest in driving growth and return excess cash to our stockholders. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted when he opened the call, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: first, I feel particularly good about our Q4 and fiscal year '15 performance. In the face of a challenging economic environment, Clorox people have really stepped up to drive results. We're accelerating growth, and we're doing so profitably as evident in the strong top and bottom line results we reported today. 
And as Steve Robb noted, in fiscal year '15, we generated the highest level of free cash flow in more than 10 years. Our increased demand-building investments are paying off in category growth and market share gains, with Q4 market share growth the highest it has been in 4 years from strong contributions across most of the portfolio. 
And we're making good progress against our Strategy 2020 accelerators. I believe that they will continue to create value to drive profitable growth in the years to come. 
Two standout examples from fiscal year '15 of how we're accelerating portfolio momentum are our e-commerce and U.S. Burt's Bees businesses, where we stepped up our investments to drive strong double-digit sales gains. 
Second, our outlook reflects a very healthy base business but also the reality of an increasingly difficult International environment. And as you think about our fiscal year '16 outlook, please consider the following: our strategic choice is out working for us in the marketplace, and we feel very good about our U.S. business, which is fundamentally very healthy. And, at the same time, in our International business, foreign exchange headwinds are strong across all major currencies, with recent double-digit exchange rate declines, and international economies are slowing. In response, we've made the conscious decision to reduce spending across much of our International business and accept somewhat slower growth in those markets as we focus on rebuilding our margins. 
Third, our outlook is balanced, reflecting our view of strength, opportunities and challenges. We'll continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working so well for us, including driving demand in our core business as well as trial of new products behind a strong innovation program, supported with increased U.S. advertising, sales promotion and trade promotion spending. 
Our biggest challenge in the near term really is our International business as we've discussed today. Longer term, I feel very good about the prospect for this division. We have leading brands that are growing market shares, and we have promising growth platforms, including Burt's Bees, which is now in a large number of countries. So when the foreign exchange headwinds subside and international economies improve, I do believe our International business will be in a solid position to benefit. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

So let me start with the first question on capital expenditures. Yes, historically, we spent at the level of depreciation and amortization, and I think that's still the right level for the company over the long term. It has been a bit less than that over the last 2 years, as you pointed out, and that was a conscious decision in our part after we made some pretty significant investments to rebuild R&D facilities, put SAP into the Latin American business. But I think for long-term modeling, certainly how we think about it is CapEx should run in line with depreciation and amortization. In terms of the priorities for the use of cash, these remain unchanged. The #1 goal is to accelerate top line growth profitably, and we think we've got plenty of cash to do that, but we'd like to do that organically. Second is we're still committed to bolt-on acquisitions through our M&A efforts. It's been more challenging over the last couple of years, but we're cautiously optimistic we'll get some traction on that over the next year or 2. The dividend has been very important to many of our investors, and so we've been prioritizing returning cash through that dividend over the last couple of years, and I think you'll see us continue to do that. And then if we've got excess cash that's pulling up again as we've done for many years either through the dividend or share repurchases, we'd love to get it back. So no change to capital allocation for the company. It'll continue to be disciplined and consistent with the priorities that we've outlined before."

Originally, when we started the Strategy 2020 journey, we thought that we would step into that over time, and we certainly saw an opportunity over the last fiscal year to step into it faster, which we have in the back half. So this 1 percentage point increase is still the right target.

I think and commodities will likely be a tailwind certainly for the first half of the fiscal year is what we're modeling. The things that will mitigate a lot of this, to some extent, manufacturing and logistics was about 110 basis points for the full year this year, and I think it's likely to continue to be a headwind for some time for us. FX is a big issue because that puts a drag on the margins. And then finally, as we indicated a few minutes ago, we are going to step up our level of trade promotion investment behind these new products and retail execution. So when you net all of those things together, we think gross margin will be about flat. Now here's what important to remember.

But if pricing is up, volume leverage you're going to get, commodities are a help, cost savings help, and you mentioned the offsets of that are effectively from trade spend, which is only going to be about half of commodities. You really only have FX as the last bucket, and you can make estimates and slide to see the way, but it feels like you're talking about several hundred basis points of gross margin impact from FX. I don't know if that can be right. So within that FX, can you disaggregate that a little bit, give us some thoughts on why you're -- why you think it's that bad, and particularly you mentioned the release that you're believe is going to be Argentine and deval there, that's different than a lot of other companies we're hearing from.

That'll come through trade spending and in the short term, that's depressive to gross margin over the long term as you drive trial and repeat it's a good thing. Manufacturing logistics costs, which doesn't impact us probably a little bit more than other companies because we tend to run heavier loads and longer lanes. So that'll be some pressure, and then again foreign currency obviously is going to continue to be a drag, including Argentina. Let me spend a minute on your question regarding Argentina because I recognize that we are probably a bit unique in terms of putting this into the outlook, but we think it's prudent to put this into the outlook, and why is that? Well, number one, inflation rates, as we all know, in Argentina are running well ahead of a lot of other companies or countries. Number two, we've not seen a devaluation in that country for quite some time, and most of the leading economies are actually projecting that there will be a major devaluation sometime in the next year or so. And third, and this is a very important point. One of the leading indicators of the devaluation is the difference between the parallel rate and the official government rate, and that has been widening pretty consistently in Argentina for some time. So for all of those reasons, we do think devaluation in Argentina is likely. Obviously, the timing and the amount is very difficult to call, but we want to call that out and put that in the outlook because we thought that was important for people to understand, and we'll need to get further into the year and see how that actually plays out that we do think there's a real risk for this company and probably for other companies and Argentina."

The fact that the margin was down a bit in the fourth quarter, not concerned. We're spending a bit more behind Burt's Bees. We've got the lip color launch that Benno talked it's going incredibly well. So it was a conscious decision on our part invest a bit more in that business. And from a top line growth standpoint, I think we continue to feel very good about Burt's for the full year. It was double-digit grower. The Brita business has been a bit of a drag of the business, but I was very pleased to see in the fourth quarter, we actually had some positive growth on Brita, and so I think some of the actions we're taking are starting to get traction. And again, Hidden Valley Ranch continues to perform well, but we did struggle a bit with KC Masterpiece, and that hurt us a bit in the quarter.

So I look at that as glass half-empty, I guess, and I think there's still some opportunity to keep driving impulse purchases and Household penetration that way. But also Clorox Clean-Up sprays and Toilet Bowl Cleaners, and those are significant businesses. They were up double digits in sales in the last quarter. So I feel like the Home Care strength is relatively broad-based and also fueled by a relatively strong innovation program. Bleach, we talked, was up. Clorox 2 grew share significantly, and that's been a departure from previous trends, and we're feeling good about that business. And also our professional business displayed really solid growth. So in a nutshell, I'm feeling good about the momentum across all of Cleaning. We'll keep investing in profitable growth.

Frankly, if you look at the last 4- to 5-week share period, it's the only business that not growing share. So not happy where it is, and my message on the business really is unchanged compared to what we said last quarter. We're not after buying share back. We want to earn share back, and what that requires is strong innovation. The competitive landscape in this category has changed. It is a very competitive category, and it does require more and more frequent innovation in the category. We're feeling good about Lightweight Litter, which, as you noted, was launched last year, and that's going nicely, and we're investing behind it. But it does require more significant innovation, and what we've said before is that innovation will come in the back half of this fiscal year, and that's exactly what will happen. So I do think that it will take until the back half until we will see shares materially improve. But I'm confident that that's going to happen based on what I know about this innovation, and we'll certainly let you know more once we can talk about it in one of the next quarter earnings releases."

Turning to our commentary. There are 3 key messages we'd like you to take away from today's call: first, we're very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal year '15 performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth and to do so profitably; second, our base is as healthy as it has been in recent memory, and we're investing behind our business, at the same time, there are a few factors we anticipate will somewhat moderate fiscal year '16 growth in comparison to fiscal year '15; and third, we believe our outlook for fiscal year '16 presents a balanced view that appropriately accounts for current strengths, opportunities and a few challenges. 
With that, I'll cover the highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.
In Q4, sales grew 4%, driven by volume growth of 3% and the benefit of price increases, partially offset by 2 points of negative foreign currency. All major currencies were down double digits due to the strong U.S. dollar with the Argentine peso having the greatest impact. 
On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter sales grew 6%. For the fiscal year, volume grew 2% while sales climbed 3%. And on a currency-neutral basis, full year sales increased 5 points, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. behind improving category growth rates and 3 percentage points of growth from innovation as well as growth in International, excluding foreign currency headwinds behind price increases and higher shipments. 
This is the fourth consecutive fiscal year we've delivered 3 points of growth from innovation. Driving improved category trends and market shares has been a top priority for us. And in Q4, our U.S. market shares increased 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter, our largest market share gain in 4 years. 6 of our 8 business units increased market share versus the year-ago quarter with Laundry, Home Care and Charcoal achieving the greatest gains. And our categories grew 2.8% during the quarter, the strongest rate in several years. 
With that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q4 volume grew 7%, and sales increased 9% with sales up strongly in each business unit. Home Care, our largest domestic business unit, was supported by double-digit growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, driven by increased investment in demand-building, including high levels of quality merchandising support, highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products. By fiscal year-end, Home Care had achieved 14 consecutive months of market share gains. 
Laundry sales increased mid-single digits, driven by our February 2015 price increase on Clorox Liquid Bleach. And in June, just a few months ago, we introduced Clorox Bleach Crystals and solid packs. These nonliquid products provide the power of Clorox bleach in a convenient form for consumers with no spilling or splashing. Overall, our bleach share for the quarter was flat with gains on Clorox Splash-less bleach, offset by declines on our regular incentive bleach product. Splash-less bleach is the fastest growing part of the bleach category, and Clorox's share in this Premium segment is 7x that of the combined private-label offerings. 
Finally, strong volume and sales gains on our Professional Products business were driven by higher shipments of our base health care products as well as professional Cleaning and Food products. 
In our Household segment, fourth quarter volume increased 2%, and sales grew 4%, driven by high single-digit volume gains in our Bags and Wraps business. Premium trash bags continued to be a real contributor behind innovation on our OdorShield lineup and new Gain scented trash bags that had strong early success. These innovations supporting consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, as well as price increases taken last calendar year, helped drive higher sales and a meaningful market share gain in the quarter. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume increased slightly, driven by our Fresh Step brand while sales and market share declined as a result of continued competitive pressure. We've been investing more aggressively to communicate our excellent clumping and odor control benefit and to bring innovation to market. Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme, launched in August of last year, continues to grow behind its promise to eliminate odor for 10 days and a money back guarantee. 
Our Charcoal business. Volume and sales declined slightly following very strong double-digit growth in the prior quarter. Looking into combined quarters, Q3 and Q4 delivered all-time record shipments on Charcoal, and our business realized strong share gains in Q4. That said, we're now lapping another double-digit quarter from a year ago as we anticipate shipping declines in Charcoal in the first quarter of fiscal year '16. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales were flat as strong mid-single-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees were offset by slight volume declines in our Brita and Food businesses. Gains in Burt's Bees were driven by the Renewal Face Care line introduced a year ago and ongoing strength in facial towelettes. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 2% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Including the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and cleaning utensils. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '15 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '16."
89450,306142434,847094,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '15 with our Domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. In addition, Interna",1141,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '15 with our Domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. 
In addition, International delivered strong sales increases on a currency-neutral basis behind higher volume and well-executed price increases to mitigate inflationary pressures. Importantly, the strength of our total company results led to a record year of free cash flow, reflecting solid top line growth and margin expansion in fiscal '15. 
Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our fourth quarter, sales grew 4% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 270 basis points to 45.6%, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2 points to 14.2%, primarily from higher performance-based incentive costs, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. This compares to an unusually low 12.2% of sales in the year-ago period when incentive costs were lower due to the company's results falling below target. 
As a reminder, the largest impact from the higher incentive costs is reflected in selling and administrative expenses, but it's also included in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. 
Advertising investment for the quarter was close to 10% of sales, reflecting support for our domestic brands and categories at nearly 11% of U.S. sales, partially offset by reduced spending in economically challenged International markets. Importantly, we were pleased to see that our brand investments are paying off and strong category growth with increases in 6 out of 8 U.S. categories. 
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44, an 11% increase versus the year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. In addition, the sale of real estate assets by a low-income housing partnership contributed a onetime benefit of about $0.06 to diluted earnings per share. 
Now we'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew nearly 3% with volume and pricing each contributing a little more than 2 points, partially offset by more than 2 points of foreign currency declines. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased 90 basis points to 43.6% compared to 42.7% in fiscal year 2014, driven primarily by 140 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 0.5 points to 14.1%, primarily from higher year-over-year incentive costs. Overall, expenses were in line with our expectations for fiscal year '15 and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of sales. Advertising spending for the fiscal year was more than 9% of sales with domestic spending at about 10% of U.S. sales. 
For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 34.2% versus 34.6% in the year-ago period. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.57 compared with $4.39 in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%.  Fiscal year '15 free cash flow was $733 million compared with $649 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, and this is the highest level we've delivered in more than 10 years. 
As we mentioned in the press release, we've repurchased about 4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $434 million in fiscal year '15 to offset stock option dilution. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter.  At the end of fiscal year '15, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of flat to 1%, which takes into account several factors. First, we feel really good about the progress we're making in our U.S. business. We're also confident in the strength of our innovation program, which we anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth. Second, we plan to increase trade promotion spending to support our brands, including managing price gaps following the 2 price increases on Glad trash and bleach taken in the last 18 months. 
And third, we anticipate fiscal year sales to be negatively impacted by several factors in International, including continued slowing of International economies and about 3 points of foreign currency declines with about half is anticipated from a significant devaluation of Argentina's currency. In addition, we plan to reduce our International demand-building investments in economically challenged markets, which will also impact sales growth. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings, pricing and somewhat lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other moderating factors include higher trade spending and foreign currency declines. 
As a reminder, declining foreign currencies negatively impact both our top line results and margins, particularly in markets where we pay for input costs in U.S. dollars. We do anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year '16. We also expect EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting flat gross margins and lower selling and administrative cost. We project that our fiscal year '16 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate our fiscal year '16 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83. 
In closing, I feel really good about the strong finish to the fiscal year. Incremental investments behind our brands are paying off in category growth and market share gains across several brands. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies, resulting in another year of strong cost savings allowing us to expand our margins. In fiscal '16, we expect to face continued headwinds, particularly in our International business. However, we've managed through these challenges before and I'm confident in the plans we have in place, including leaning into our pipeline of cost savings programs. Importantly, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to invest in driving growth and return excess cash to our stockholders. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted when he opened the call, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: First, I feel particularly good about our Q4 and fiscal year '15 performance. In the face of a challenging economic environment, Clorox people have really stepped up to drive results. We're accelerating growth, and we're doing so profitably as evident in the strong top and bottom line results we reported today. 
And as Steve Robb noted, in fiscal year '15, we generated the highest level of free cash flow in more than 10 years. Our increased demand-building investments are paying off in category growth and market share gains, with Q4 market share growth the highest it had been in 4 years, from strong contributions across most of the portfolio. And we're making good progress against our Strategy 2020 accelerators. I believe that they will continue to create value to drive profitable growth in the years to come. Two standout examples from fiscal year '15 of how we're accelerating portfolio momentum, our e-commerce and U.S. Burt's Bees businesses, where we stepped up our investments to drive strong double-digit sales gains. 
Second, our outlook reflects a very healthy base business, but also the reality of an increasingly difficult International environment. As you think about our fiscal year '16 outlook, please consider the following: Our strategic choices are working for us in the marketplace, and we feel very good about our U.S. business, which is fundamentally very healthy. Now at the same time, in our International business, foreign exchange headwinds are strong across all major currencies, with recent double-digit exchange rate declines and international economies are slowing. In response, we've made the conscious decision to reduce spending across much of our International business and accept somewhat slower growth in those markets as we focus on rebuilding our margins. 
Third, our outlook is balanced, reflecting our view of strength, opportunities and challenges. We'll continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working so well for us, including driving demand on our core business as well as trial of new products behind a strong innovation program, supported with increased U.S. advertising, sales promotion and trade promotion spending. 
Our biggest challenge in the near term really is our International business as we've discussed today. Longer term, I feel very good about the prospect for this division. We have leading brands that are growing market shares and we have promising growth platforms, including Burt's Bees, which is now in a large number of countries. So when the foreign exchange headwinds subside and international economies improve, I do believe our International business will be in a solid position to benefit. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

And why you're not more encouraged looking ahead to '16?"

First, to drive trial of our new products because we know if we can get trial, we generally do well with repeat on those new products. And then second is just to support retail execution. So we have been stepping up the investment. We're going to do a bit more because it's working for us, and the payouts look good, but it is flowing through the P&L."

So let me start with the first question on capital expenditures. Yes, historically, we've spent at the level of depreciation and amortization, and I think that's still the right level for the company over the long term. It has been a bit less than that over the last 2 years, as you pointed out, and that was a conscious decision in our part after we've made some pretty significant investments to rebuild R&D facilities, put SAP into the Latin American business. But I think for long-term modeling, certainly how we think about it is, CapEx should run in line with depreciation and amortization. In terms of the priorities for the use of cash, these remain unchanged. The #1 goal is to accelerate top line growth profitably and we think we've got plenty of cash to do that, but we'd like to do that organically. Second is we're still committed to bolt-on acquisitions through our M&A efforts. It's been more challenging over the last couple of years, but we're cautiously optimistic we'll get some traction on that over the next year or 2. The dividend has been very important to many of our investors, and so we've been prioritizing returning cash through that dividend over the last couple of years, and I think you'll see us continue to do that. And then if we've got excess cash that's pulling up again as we've done for many years either through the dividend or share repurchases, we'd love to get it back. So no change to capital allocation for the company. It'll continue to be disciplined and consistent with the priorities that we've outlined before."

Really, where we see the ROI is we're pretty disciplined in how we measure ROI and how we spend our dollars depending on where we get the greatest return. That is still the right number. Originally, when we started the Strategy 2020 journey, we thought that we would step into that over time, and we certainly saw an opportunity over the last fiscal year to step into it faster, which we have in the back half. So this 1 percentage point increase is still the right target. It's working, certainly, as you've seen in top line growth, as you've seen in share growth, but it's also working given that, as you know we're interested in profitable growth, so we see it flow through in the bottom line.

I think, and commodities will likely be a tailwind, certainly, for the first half of the fiscal year is what we're modeling. The things that will mitigate a lot of this, to some extent, manufacturing and logistics was about 110 basis points for the full year this year. And I think it's likely to continue to be a headwind for some time for us. FX is a big issue because that puts a drag on the margins. And then finally, as we indicated a few minutes ago, we are going to step up our level of trade promotion investments behind these new products and retail execution. So when you net all of those things together, we think gross margin will be about flat. Now here's what important to remember. We've got a good plan in place to drive EBIT margin expansion in fiscal '16. So we are targeting 25 to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion, and we feel like we're very much on track to deliver that for the full fiscal year."

It's a category where there is a sizable consumer need for natural products, and we have a wonderful product out there, both in terms of product performance as well as in terms of packaging that we think is highly differentiated, and we have started to engage our customers in this opportunity and are getting real enthusiastic response.

Manufacturing logistics costs, which does impact us probably a little bit more than other companies because we tend to run heavier loads and longer lanes, so that'll be some pressure. And then again foreign currency, obviously, is going to continue to be a drag, including Argentina. Let me spend a minute on your question regarding Argentina because I recognize that we're probably a bit unique in terms of putting this into the outlook. But we think it's prudent to put this into the outlook, and why is that? Well, number one, inflation rates, as we all know, in Argentina are running well ahead of a lot of other companies or countries. Number two, we have not seen a devaluation in that country for quite some time, and most of the leading economists are actually projecting that there will be a major devaluation sometime in the next year or so. And third, and this is a very important point. One of the leading indicators of a devaluation is the difference between the parallel rate and the official government rate, and that has been widening pretty consistently in Argentina for some time. So for all of those reasons, we do think devaluation in Argentina is likely. Obviously, the timing and the amount is very difficult to call, but we want to call that out and put that in the outlook because we thought that was important for people to understand, and we'll need to get further into the year and see how that actually plays out, but we do think there's a real risk for this company and probably for other companies in Argentina."

Glad, I would call that better than expected with strong sales growth but also strong volume growth, and I would associate that with a really strong start behind our Glad OdorShield Febreze with Gain scented trash bags that have helped us grow, not just dollar share but also volume share in the last quarter. And we'll certainly continue to invest in that, because we have a lot of momentum in that. In Q1, we'll double down on innovation and we will launch, for the first time, Glad with Clorox trash bags. And what that is, is a new premium trash bag with an antimicrobial agent embedded in the drawstring, and we think that that'll continue to extend the string of nice successes we've had behind innovation in the category.

Certainly, Wipes has been up double digits, and I would say that we're certainly investing in merchandising. But as we invest in merchandising, it's behind innovations and it's to drive trial. Because as you'll recall, the Household penetration in this category is still at or about 50%. So I look at that as glass half-empty, I guess, and there's still some opportunity to keep driving impulse purchases and Household penetration that way. But also Clorox Clean-Up sprays and our Toilet Bowl Cleaners, and those are significant businesses. They were up double digits in sales in the last quarter. So I feel like the Home Care strength is relatively broad-based and also fueled by a relatively strong innovation program. Bleach, we talked, was up. Clorox, too, grew share significantly, and that's been a departure from previous trends, and we're feeling good about that business. And also our professional business displayed really solid growth. So in a nutshell, I'm feeling good about the momentum across all of Cleaning. We'll keep investing in profitable growth. Certainly results, at this point, are particularly strong, and I would be cautious to say that we should expect a continuation of trends like it.

Turning to our commentary. There are 3 key messages we'd like you to take away from today's call: first, we're very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal year '15 performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth and to do so profitably; second, our base is as healthy as it has been in recent memory, and we're investing behind our business, at the same time, there are a few factors we anticipate will somewhat moderate fiscal year '16 growth in comparison to fiscal year '15; and third, we believe our outlook for fiscal year '16 presents a balanced view that appropriately accounts for current strengths, opportunities and a few challenges. 
With that, I'll cover the highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.
In Q4, sales grew 4%, driven by volume growth of 3% and the benefit of price increases, partially offset by 2 points of negative foreign currency. All major currencies were down double digits due to the strong U.S. dollar with the Argentine peso having the greatest impact. 
On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter sales grew 6%. For the fiscal year, volume grew 2% while sales climbed 3%. And on a currency-neutral basis, full year sales increased 5 points, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. behind improving category growth rates and 3 percentage points of growth from innovation as well as growth in International, excluding foreign currency headwinds behind price increases and higher shipments. 
This is the fourth consecutive fiscal year we've delivered 3 points of growth from innovation. Driving improved category trends and market shares has been a top priority for us. And in Q4, our U.S. market shares increased 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter, our largest market share gain in 4 years. Six of our 8 U.S. business units increased market share versus the year-ago quarter with Laundry, Home Care and Charcoal achieving the greatest gains. And our categories grew 2.8% during the quarter, the strongest rate in several years. 
With that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q4 volume grew 7%, and sales increased 9% with sales up strongly in each business unit. Home Care, our largest domestic business unit, was supported by double-digit growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, driven by increased investment in demand-building, including high levels of quality merchandising support, highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products. By fiscal year-end, Home Care had achieved 14 consecutive months of market share gains. 
Laundry sales increased mid-single digits, driven by our February 2015 price increase on Clorox Liquid Bleach. And in June, just a few months ago, we introduced Clorox Bleach Crystals and solid packs. These nonliquid products provide the power of Clorox bleach in a convenient form for consumers with no spilling or splashing. Overall, our bleach share for the quarter was flat with gains on Clorox Splash-less bleach, offset by declines on our regular incentive bleach products. Splash-less bleach is the fastest growing part of the bleach category, and Clorox's share in this Premium segment is 7x that of the combined private-label offerings. 
Finally, strong volume and sales gains on our Professional Products business were driven by higher shipments of our base health care products as well as professional Cleaning and Food products. 
In our Household segment, fourth quarter volume increased 2%, and sales grew 4%, driven by high single-digit volume gains in our Bags and Wraps business. Premium trash bags continued to be a real contributor behind innovation on our OdorShield lineup and new Gain scented trash bags that had strong early success. These innovations supporting consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, as well as price increases taken last calendar year, helped drive higher sales and a meaningful market share gain in the quarter. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume increased slightly, driven by our Fresh Step brand while sales and market share declined as a result of continued competitive pressure. We've been investing more aggressively to communicate our excellent clumping and odor control benefit and to bring innovation to market. Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme, launched in August of last year, continues to grow behind its promise to eliminate odor for 10 days and a money back guarantee. 
Our Charcoal business. Volume and sales declined slightly following very strong double-digit growth in the prior quarter. Looking into combined quarters, Q3 and Q4 delivered all-time record shipments on Charcoal, and our business realized strong share gains in Q4. That said, we're now lapping another double-digit quarter from a year ago as we anticipate shipment declines in Charcoal in the first quarter of fiscal year '16. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales were flat as strong mid-single-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees were offset by slight volume declines in our Brita and Food businesses. Gains in Burt's Bees were driven by the Renewal Face Care line introduced a year ago and ongoing strength in facial towelettes. 
Turning to International. Volume was up 2% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Including the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and cleaning utensils. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '15 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '16."
89450,306142434,847269,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '15 with our Domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. In addition, Interna",1142,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '15 with our Domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. 
In addition, International delivered strong sales increases on a currency-neutral basis behind higher volume and well-executed price increases to mitigate inflationary pressures. Importantly, the strength of our total company results led to a record year of free cash flow, reflecting solid top line growth and margin expansion in fiscal '15. 
Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our fourth quarter, sales grew 4% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 270 basis points to 45.6%, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2 points to 14.2%, primarily from higher performance-based incentive costs, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. This compares to an unusually low 12.2% of sales in the year-ago period when incentive costs were lower due to the company's results falling below target. 
As a reminder, the largest impact from the higher incentive costs is reflected in selling and administrative expenses, but it's also included in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. 
Advertising investment for the quarter was close to 10% of sales, reflecting support for our domestic brands and categories at nearly 11% of U.S. sales, partially offset by reduced spending in economically challenged International markets. Importantly, we were pleased to see that our brand investments are paying off in strong category growth with increases in 6 out of 8 U.S. categories. 
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44, an 11% increase versus the year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. In addition, the sale of real estate assets by a low-income housing partnership contributed a onetime benefit of about $0.06 to diluted earnings per share. 
Now we'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew nearly 3% with volume and pricing each contributing a little more than 2 points, partially offset by more than 2 points of foreign currency declines. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased 90 basis points to 43.6% compared to 42.7% in fiscal year 2014, driven primarily by 140 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 0.5 point to 14.1%, primarily from higher year-over-year incentive costs. Overall, expenses were in line with our expectations for fiscal year '15 and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of sales. Advertising spending for the fiscal year was more than 9% of sales with domestic spending at about 10% of U.S. sales. 
For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 34.2% versus 34.6% in the year-ago period. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.57 compared with $4.39 in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%. Fiscal year '15 free cash flow was $733 million compared with $649 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, and this is the highest level we've delivered in more than 10 years. 
As we mentioned in the press release, we've repurchased about 4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $434 million in fiscal year '15 to offset stock option dilution. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal year '15, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of flat to 1%, which takes into account several factors. First, we feel really good about the progress we're making in our U.S. business. We're also confident in the strength of our innovation program, which we anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth. Second, we plan to increase trade promotion spending to support our brands, including managing price gaps following the 2 price increases on Glad trash and bleach taken in the last 18 months. And third, we anticipate fiscal year sales to be negatively impacted by several factors in International, including continued slowing of International economies and about 3 points of foreign currency declines of which about half is anticipated from a significant devaluation of Argentina's currency. In addition, we plan to reduce our International demand-building investments in economically challenged markets, which will also impact sales growth. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings, pricing and somewhat lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other moderating factors include higher trade spending and foreign currency declines. 
As a reminder, declining foreign currencies negatively impact both our top line results and margins, particularly in markets where we pay for input costs in U.S. dollars. We do anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year '16. We also expect EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting flat gross margins and lower selling and administrative costs. We project that our fiscal year '16 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate our fiscal year '16 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83. 
In closing, I feel really good about the strong finish to the fiscal year. Incremental investments behind our brands are paying off in category growth and market share gains across several brands. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies, resulting in another year of strong cost savings allowing us to expand our margins. In fiscal '16, we expect to face continued headwinds, particularly in our International business. However, we've managed through these challenges before and I'm confident in the plans we have in place, including leaning into our pipeline of cost savings programs. Importantly, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to invest in driving growth and return excess cash to our stockholders. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted when he opened the call, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: First, I feel particularly good about our Q4 and fiscal year '15 performance. In the face of a challenging economic environment, Clorox people have really stepped up to drive results. We're accelerating growth, and we're doing so profitably as evident in the strong top and bottom line results we reported today. 
And as Steve Robb noted, in fiscal year '15, we generated the highest level of free cash flow in more than 10 years. Our increased demand-building investments are paying off in category growth and market share gains, with Q4 market share growth the highest it has been in 4 years, from strong contributions across most of the portfolio. And we're making good progress against our Strategy 2020 accelerators. I believe that they will continue to create value to drive profitable growth in the years to come. Two standout examples from fiscal year '15 of how we're accelerating portfolio momentum, our e-commerce and U.S. Burt's Bees businesses, where we stepped up our investments to drive strong double-digit sales gains. 
Second, our outlook reflects a very healthy base business, but also the reality of an increasingly difficult International environment. As you think about our fiscal year '16 outlook, please consider the following: Our strategic choices are working for us in the marketplace, and we feel very good about our U.S. business, which is fundamentally very healthy. Now at the same time, in our International business, foreign exchange headwinds are strong across all major currencies, with recent double-digit exchange rate declines and international economies are slowing. In response, we've made the conscious decision to reduce spending across much of our International business and accept somewhat slower growth in those markets as we focus on rebuilding our margins. 
Third, our outlook is balanced, reflecting our view of strength, opportunities and challenges. We'll continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working so well for us, including driving demand on our core business as well as trial of new products behind a strong innovation program, supported with increased U.S. advertising, sales promotions and trade promotion spending. 
Our biggest challenge in the near term really is our International business as we've discussed today. Longer term, I feel very good about the prospect for this division. We have leading brands that are growing market shares and we have promising growth platforms, including Burt's Bees, which is now in a large number of countries. So when the foreign exchange headwinds subside and international economies improve, I do believe our International business will be in a solid position to benefit. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

First, to drive trial of our new products because we know if we can get trial, we generally do well with repeat on those new products. And then second is just to support retail execution. So we have been stepping up the investment. We're going to do a bit more because it's working for us, and the payouts look good, but it is flowing through the P&L."

So let me start with the first question on capital expenditures. Yes, historically, we've spent at the level of depreciation and amortization, and I think that's still the right level for the company over the long term. It has been a bit less than t",273,"Okay. So let me start with the first question on capital expenditures. Yes, historically, we've spent at the level of depreciation and amortization, and I think that's still the right level for the company over the long term. It has been a bit less than that over the last 2 years, as you pointed out, and that was a conscious decision on our part after we'd made some pretty significant investments to rebuild R&D facilities, put SAP into the Latin American business. But I think for long-term modeling, certainly how we think about it is, CapEx should run in line with depreciation and amortization. In terms of the priorities for the use of cash, these remain unchanged. The #1 goal is to accelerate top line growth profitably and we think we've got plenty of cash to do that, but we'd like to do that organically. Second is we're still committed to bolt-on acquisitions through our M&A efforts. It's been more challenging over the last couple of years, but we're cautiously optimistic we'll get some traction on that over the next year or 2. The dividend has been very important to many of our investors, and so we've been prioritizing returning cash through that dividend over the last couple of years, and I think you'll see us continue to do that. And then if we've got excess cash that's pooling up again, as we've done for many years, either through the dividend or share repurchases, we'll look to get it back. So no change to capital allocation for the company. It'll continue to be disciplined and consistent with the priorities that we've outlined before."

Chris, so first of all, what we said is indeed we would like to spend 1 percentage point of sales over time behind our brands. We've also said that, that spending can move around, certainly move around by quarter, but also move around by bucket. So in some cases, it could be advertising, it could be sales promotion, it could be innovation supports, it could be a trade promotion or pricing. Really, where we see the ROI is we're pretty disciplined in how we measure ROI and how we spend our dollars depending on where we get the greatest return. That is still the right number. Originally, when we started the Strategy 2020 journey, we thought that we would step into that over time, and we certainly saw an opportunity over the last fiscal year to step into it faster, which we have in the back half. So this 1 percentage point increase is still the right target. It's working, certainly, as you've seen in top line growth, as you've seen in share growth, but it's also working given that, as you know we're interested in profitable growth, so we see it flow through in the bottom line. So we're staying committed to it, and it's still the right number."

Our cost savings programs continue to perform well. We're very pleased with the end market execution of the price increases that we've taken, and we'll continue to look to take pricing, particularly in International markets which, as you know, has higher rates of inflation. I think, and commodities will likely be a tailwind, certainly, for the first half of the fiscal year is what we're modeling. The things that will mitigate a lot of this, to some extent, manufacturing and logistics was about 110 basis points for the full year this year. And I think it's likely to continue to be a headwind for some time for us. FX is a big issue because that puts a drag on the margins. And then finally, as we indicated a few minutes ago, we are going to step up our level of trade promotion investment behind these new products and retail execution. So when you net all of those things together, we think gross margins will be about flat. Now here's what important to remember. We've got a good plan in place to drive EBIT margin expansion in fiscal '16. So we are targeting 25 to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion, and we feel like we're very much on track to deliver that for the full fiscal year."

And we think that there's a lot of space in this first growth pillar. Second growth pillar, getting into new categories. Third growth pillar in International. As for new categories, yes, there still is a lot of opportunity. And one thing that we will be doing in the front half that goes exactly after this opportunity is later on in the first half launch color lipsticks. So this is our first foray into lipsticks. It's a category where there is a sizable consumer need for natural products, and we have a wonderful product out there, both in terms of product performance as well as in terms of packaging that we think is highly differentiated, and we have started to engage our customers in this opportunity and are getting real enthusiastic response. So that's the next one up where we feel like we can make a significant dent in the new category.

And in the short term, that's depressive to gross margin. Over the long term, as you drive trial and repeat, it's a good thing. Manufacturing logistics costs, which does impact us probably a little bit more than other companies because we tend to run heavier loads and longer lanes, so that'll be some pressure. And then again foreign currency, obviously, is going to continue to be a drag, including Argentina. Let me spend a minute on your question regarding Argentina because I recognize that we're probably a bit unique in terms of putting this into the outlook. But we think it's prudent to put this into the outlook, and why is that? Well, number one, inflation rates, as we all know, in Argentina are running well ahead of a lot of other companies -- countries. Number two, we have not seen a devaluation in that country for quite some time, and most of the leading economists are actually projecting that there will be a major devaluation sometime in the next year or so. And third, and this is a very important point. One of the leading indicators of a devaluation is the difference between the parallel rate and the official government rate, and that has been widening pretty consistently in Argentina for some time. So for all of those reasons, we do think a devaluation in Argentina is likely. Obviously, the timing and the amount is very difficult to call, but we wanted to call that out and put that in the outlook because we thought that was important for people to understand, and we'll need to get further into the year and see how that actually plays out, but we do think there's a real risk for this company and probably for other companies in Argentina."

What we said is that we will spend an additional percentage point of sales, and we've said that those dollars will move around. So you will always see shifts between quarters. Within advertising & sales promotion, if you look at advertising sales promotion, it's actually up. So we are spending incrementally in trade, but that spending is incremental to advertising & sales promotion and not replacement to advertising & sales promotion. What we are certainly doing within advertising sales promotion is shift from International were the returns in some countries, right now, are clearly lower and we're not interested in investing in not profitable volume. And those dollars go into the U.S, where we are seeing nice return and where you see that deliver strong growth in businesses like Burt's Bees but also Home Care. So trade is incremental right now to advertising sales promotion. That's probably going to be here to stay for a little while at the somewhat elevated basis, but we're also continuing to be very committed to advertising and sales promotion spend as is evident in the fiscal year results, and we like the return in that area as well."

We have a consumer preferred product, and we're making clear to the consumer that they are aware of this value superiority. And we're certainly investing very strongly in the advertising sales promotion and also in trade promotion, like I said. And then two, innovation. And one innovation that's done particularly well for us over the last 6 months is the Wipes with the micro scrubbers for particularly tough tasks. And we're certainly driving that innovation through spending that creates awareness and trial. At the end of the day, what Wipes is on trend. We've talked to many of you in the past about consumers moving towards Cleaning in the flow occasions that don't disrupt the flow of the day, and Wipes are the preferred product form to meet this consumer need. So there's a tremendous consumer tailwind. And with a market share of -- back at about 50%, we're really poised to capitalize on that trend. So we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth in this segment."

The competitive landscape in this category has changed. It is a very competitive category, and it does require more and more frequent innovation in the category. We're feeling good about Lightweight Litter which, as you noted, was launched last year. And that's growing nicely and we're investing behind it. But it does require more significant innovation.

Turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '16 and finally, Benno will close with his perspective and open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable and consistent growth are working. 
On the top line, in Q1, volume and sales were each up 3%. Despite about 3 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and slightly higher trade spending in support of in-store merchandising, sales grew solidly, reflecting a benefit of about 2 points of pricing and a slightly favorable mix.  On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 6%. 
All of our U.S. businesses grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis. 
In the U.S., 13-week market shares increased 0.5 point versus the year-ago quarter to 23.8%. This is the highest quarterly gain as well as the highest absolute market share since the conversion 3 years ago to the broader reporting format. It's rewarding to see our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing opportunities paying off in stronger market share. More specifically, 6 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal.
In addition to market share improvement, driving improved category trends remains a top priority for us. And during the quarter, our categories were up 1.8 points, slightly lower than recent quarters, but still very healthy. 
With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume increased 5% and sales grew 6%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly. Again, it was driven by growth in all segments of our Home Care business with Clorox branded products performing well and particular strength in Clorox's Disinfecting Wipes during the back-to-school season as well as behind our new white products, which have been supported by advertising and strong retail merchandising execution. As noted a moment ago, Home Care was a key contributor to our strong market share growth and has now achieved more than 5 quarters of market share gains. 
Heading into our second quarter, we are closely watching this fall's cold and flu trends, which have been relatively muted so far and recognize we'll also be lapping strong growth in the year-ago quarter in our Professional Products Healthcare business due to Ebola and enterovirus concerns last year. That said, our Q1 results demonstrated that our Home Care business is on solid ground. 
Laundry business sales also increased in the quarter, driven in part by the benefit of an earlier Clorox Bleach price increase. From a market share standpoint, our overall bleach share dipped slightly in the quarter after 6 consecutive quarters of share growth. At the same time, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less bleach products, which are iterative from our regular product. Splash-less bleach is performing very well with the market share and segment that is higher than our share in the regular bleach segment.
In addition, Splash-less bleach is adding household penetration at the expense of private label as we drive growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of winning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
In our Household segment, we delivered 1% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Bags and Wraps and our Charcoal business. In Bags and Wraps, sales were up mid-single digits behind innovation in premium trash bags as well as a price increase taken in late calendar year 2014. Similar to my comment on the bleach business where we are benefiting from growth on higher-margin Splash-less bleach, the Glad business is driving category trade-up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings.
Following a number of new scent offerings, new Glad OdorShield trash bags with the scent of Gain had been particularly successful supported by advertising and strong digital marketing. Further, we look forward to sharing with you additional innovation in the Glad's premium trash bag segment as part of our next quarter's discussion. 
In the Charcoal business, sales also grew strongly and frankly, much stronger-than-anticipated due to promotions, consumption and outstanding retail execution behind the U.S. Labor Day holiday. In the quarter, we were lapping double-digit growth a year ago, so we were very pleased to deliver solid results on top of that. There is some risk, especially given the wet El Nino weather being forecast, the consumption will slow, particularly falling last year's mid-single-digit growth. While weather may tamper near-term results, our Charcoal business is clearly performing very well. 
Turning to Cat Litter, while our volume declined in this competitive category, Q1 sales increased behind the performance of our lightweight products. While competition in this category will remain intense over the next several quarters, we're looking forward to the launch of new Fresh Step with Febreze in calendar year 2016, which will make us stronger competitively. 
In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 8% and sales grew 7% with volume and sales improving in all 3 business units: Food, Burt's Bees and Brita. Our food business performed strongly behind our Ranch bottled dressing such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic, as well as our Dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes, such as Greek Yogurt. 
On our Burt's Bees business, volume and sales grew double digits, largely due to innovation face care products as well as the earlier timing of holiday shipments.
Facial towelette has also continued to perform very strongly. Burt's Bees now holds the #4 market share position in the lip category, an impressive positon recognizing the crown category includes both conventional and natural offerings, such as Burt's Bees.
Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business, our strategy to drive trial of systems showed encouraging results in Q1 delivering mid-single-digit volume and sales growth behind strong execution during the back-to-school period and incremental distribution gains in e-commerce.
Turning to International, volume was -- volume for the quarter was flat whereas sales declined 8%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially across all markets. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 5%.
Steve will discuss our financial results momentarily but we're pleased that our go-in strategy in International is working as we focus on pricing maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Strong execution of our goalie strategy in International is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, recognizing the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our International business.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're pleased with our top line performance as we look to the balance of the fiscal year 2016, we remain committed to growing profitably through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating through our 3D brand-building approach the value that our products provide consumers regardless of price point.
Factoring in our strong Q1 sales performance as well as our outlook for unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as stepped up competitive pressure in the second half the year, we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb who will provide more detail in our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016."
89450,313048382,889339,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Welcome, everyone.

While we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter, we grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we expanded our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all our U.S. business segments.
Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our first quarter, sales grew 3% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points. Sales results also reflected nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher trade promotion spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 45%, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at 13.4% of sales. 
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was close to 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago period. 
In total, demand building investments including trade promotion spending increased $13 million, reflecting support product innovation, which contributed to category growth and market share gains in the quarter.
Now all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.32, a 20% increase versus a year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $107 million or about 8% of sales compared with $205 million in the year-ago quarter or about 15% of sales. Free cash flow in the first quarter was lower largely due to higher performance-based employee incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year 2015 results. Looking forward, we anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased about 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $112 million to offset stock option dilution. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong first quarter sales growth and slower growth rates in subsequent quarters.  
Our sales outlook also takes into account the following factors: Ongoing investment behind our innovation program, which we continue to anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth for the full year; continued slowing international economies with about 3 points of impact from foreign currency declines. With the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we're closely monitory the possibility of worsening exchange rates in the balance of the fiscal year. And finally, in light of the positive momentum in our market shares, we're preparing to address potential heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year, particularly in key categories, including Bags and Wraps, Litter and Home Care.
Turning to margin. Previously, we had assumed gross margin would be flat for the full fiscal year. However, based on our strong first quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin to increase modestly or about 25 to 50 basis points. The benefit of cost savings, pricing and lower commodity costs are expected to be partially offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics cost. Other moderating factors include higher trade promotion spending and foreign currency declines. Importantly, we anticipate reinvesting a significant portion of the benefits realized from lower commodity cost to drive top line growth. 
We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year '16. We also continue to anticipate EBIT margin to increase in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting moderate gross margin expansion, moderated by incremental investments in consumer demand building programs and increased support behind our cost savings programs to fuel profitable growth. 
We continue to anticipate our fiscal year '16 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of 34% to 35%. And net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate our fiscal year '16 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83.
Considering the strength of our first quarter results and our confidence in executing our strategy, we're cautiously optimistic about the possibility of being in the upper end of our outlook ranges for sales and earnings. However, it's too early in the year, and we need more time to see how the macroeconomic and competitive challenges unfold in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate facing a more challenging second half. Nonetheless, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, particularly behind product innovation and our cost savings programs will continue to be priorities. 
With that, I'll turn over to Benno."
89450,313048382,889339,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Steve.

First, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work, and that's reflected in our Q1 results. Second, because our strategy is working, we're staying the course, investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And third, we continue to face pronounced headwinds in of the balance of the year, and we've reflected that in our outlook. So let me summarize my perspective on these 3 areas.
First, our Q1 results are strong indicators our strategy is working. Some highlights include the fact that our U.S. business achieved the strongest sales growth in several years and delivered it across all segments. Further, while currency effects are real and cannot be dismissed, our International business delivered solid sales growth on a currency-neutral basis and saw positive results from our goalie strategy with solid profit growth in U.S. dollars as well as in local currencies. In addition, a strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand building investments, translated to category growth as well as the highest quarterly market share growth and our highest absolute U.S. market share in 3 years.
And our focus on profitable growth, supported by trade-up, cost savings and commodity tailwinds help drive meaningful margin expansion in the quarter with margin growth in all 4 segments, including International. 
So our strategy is continuing to work, and we're staying the course to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. 
In International, where our business remains challenged, in part due to foreign currencies, much like every other U.S.-based company, I'm proud of the tough decisions our team has made to improve profitability across their business for our shareholders. In particular, I believe the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy: Pricing, cost savings, rightsizing and optimizing demand spending, will pay off in the long term. I feel very good about the future of this business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries. 
Turning to the U.S. We have a robust innovation pipeline across our portfolio and we'll continue investing in the business and focusing on delivering strong value to consumers. Our domestic business is healthy, and we intend to continue supporting it with advertising and marketing communications, sales and trade promotion spending and strong retail execution. As many of you heard at our Analyst Meeting in early October, our analysis of traditional versus digital forms of brand-building show that we're keenly focused on ROIs and ensuring our demand creation dollars work hard for us. 
We feel good about where we are at the same time, it's still very early of the year. As Steve Robb discussed, going forward, we'll be monitoring foreign exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year and commodity costs, which remain volatile and tend to rise over time. All said, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, which is reflected in what I believe to be a balanced outlook. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

First, Home Care, we're we've gained a lot of market share for 5 quarters now and typically, what happens is that, that will yield a stronger competitive reaction to that market share growth. In Cat Litter, as is very well-known by now, we have innovation coming up in the back half and we think that that's going to increase the competitive activity in the category. And then in Glad, the third category where we are expecting somewhat heightened competitive activity, commodities have been somewhat of a tailwind and we are investing in growth, reinvesting effectively much of that commodities goodness back in the business. So we expect that the competitive activity in these 3 categories is going to be heightened. We reflected that in our outlook and as I said, we continue to stay in the drivers seat and invest in profitable growth."

As we get into the second half of the fiscal year, 2 things we're going to monitor very closely. Number one is just energy prices because that could have an influencing impact. Second is overseas markets because it is a supply and demand market. And then third, production capacity appears to be somewhat that depending on who you listen to and it doesn't take much of a supply disruption to cause those markets to move up quickly. So I think we'll get tailwinds for the year, there'll be more in the first half and in the second half. And we'll start to lap that as we move through the fiscal year."

Our conversations really have not changed. What Walmart is looking growth is growth that's profitable, and that's what we're looking for. What Walmart is looking for is innovation and they've been particularly receptive, as have many other retailers, to strong innovation and are there isn't a lot of great innovation out there in the marketplace right now as we look at various categories and as you know, we're very committed to innovation. Our innovation program is pretty strong. Fundamentally, they invest in where we invest in. They invest in neighborhood markets and they invest in e-commerce. Those are areas that we're interested in and those are areas where market-leading brands will benefit from. So I can tell you that why, as you appreciate, can't comment on specific conversations that will have with them every day. The conversations with all the with of them are predominantly around growth, and that's not changed over the last few years."

The opportunity to take targeted pricing, particularly in International markets, and even rebuild our International margins through our Go Lean approach as well as SG&A management, all of those things and our cost savings programs I think it's his confidence that we're going to deliver good, steady margin expansion.

When we went into this year, we thought foreign currency headwinds would be about 3-point drag on top line sales. If you just look at the U.S. dollars but rate today, they're a bit worse than we thought so that's really something we're watching closely, and we're expecting a significant devaluation in Argentina. So I do think of the International business is probably going to continue to face a tough situation over the next couple of quarters, which is why again, when we're trying to do is focus on innovation in that business, focus on driving cost savings, leveraging our U.S. capabilities and really take targeted pricing where we can get it.

Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with the GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.
Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective and open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. As this quarter's performance highlights the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable and consistent growth are working.
On the top line, in Q1, volume and sales were each up 3%. Despite about 3 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and slightly higher trade spending in support of in-store merchandising, sales grew solidly, reflecting the benefit of about 2 points of pricing and slightly favorable mix. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 6%.
All of our U.S. businesses grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis.
In the U.S., 13-week market shares increased 0.5 point versus the year-ago quarter to 23.8%. This is the highest quarterly gain as well as the highest absolute market share since the conversion 3 years ago to the broader MULO reporting format. It's rewarding to see our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing opportunities paying off in stronger market share. More specifically, 6 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal.
In addition to market share improvement, driving improved category trends remains a top priority for us. And during the quarter, our categories were up 1.8 points, slightly lower than recent quarters but still very healthy.
With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume increased 5% and sales grew 6%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly. The gain was driven by growth in all segments of our Home Care business with Clorox branded products performing well and particular strength in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes during the back-to-school season as well as behind our new wipe products, which have been supported by advertising and strong retail merchandising execution. As noted a moment ago, Home Care was a key contributor to our strong market share growth and has now achieved more than 5 quarters of market share gains.
Heading into our second quarter, we are closely watching this fall's cold and flu trends, which have been relatively muted so far and recognize we'll also be lapping strong growth in the year-ago quarter in our Professional Products Healthcare business due to Ebola and enterovirus concerns last year. That said, our Q1 results demonstrate that our Home Care business is on solid ground.
Laundry business sales also increased in the quarter, driven in part by the benefit of an earlier Clorox Bleach price increase. From a market share standpoint, our overall bleach share dipped slightly in the quarter after 6 consecutive quarters of share growth. At the same time, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less bleach products, which are trade up from our regular product.
Splash-less bleach is performing very well with the market share and segment that is higher than our share in the regular bleach segment. In addition, Splash-less bleach is adding Household penetration at the expense of private label, as we drive growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of winning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
In our Household segment, we delivered 1% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Bags and Wraps and our Charcoal business. In Bags and Wraps, sales were up mid-single digits behind innovation in premium trash bags as well as a price increase taken in late calendar year 2014. Similar to my comments on the bleach business, where we are benefiting from growth on higher-margin Splash-less bleach, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings.
Following a number of new scent offerings, new Glad OdorShield trash bags with the scent of Gain have been particularly successful supported by advertising and strong digital marketing. Further, we look forward to sharing with you additional innovation in the Glad's premium trash bag segment as part of our next quarter's discussion.
In the Charcoal business, sales also grew strongly and frankly, much stronger-than-anticipated due to promotions, consumption and outstanding retail execution behind the U.S. Labor Day holiday. In the quarter, we were lapping double-digit growth a year ago. So we were very pleased to deliver strong results on top of that. There is some risk, especially given the wet El Niño weather pattern being forecast, the consumption will slow, particularly following last year's mid-single-digit growth. While weather may tamper near-term results, our Charcoal business is clearly performing very well.
Turning to Cat Litter, while our volume declined in this competitive category, Q1 sales increased behind the performance of our lightweight products. While competition in this category will remain intense over the next several quarters, we're looking forward to the launch of new Fresh Step with Febreze in calendar year 2016, which will make us stronger competitively.
In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 8% and sales grew 7%, with volume and sales improving in all 3 business units: Food, Burt's Bees and Brita. Our food business performed strongly behind our ranch with bottled salad dressing such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic as well as our Dry Hidden Valley dressing and Dip Mixes, such as Greek Yogurt.
On our Burt's Bees business, volume and sales grew double digits, largely due to innovation in face-care products as well as the earlier timing of holiday shipments.
Facial towelette also continued to perform very strongly. Burt's Bees now holds the #4 market share position in the Lip Crayon category, an impressive positon recognizing the crayon category includes both conventional and natural offerings, such as Burt's Bees.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business. Our strategy to drive trial of pour-through systems showed encouraging results in Q1, delivering mid-single-digit volume and sales growth behind strong execution during the back-to-school period and incremental distribution gains in e-commerce.
Turning to International. Volume was -- volume for the quarter was flat, whereas sales declined 8%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially across all markets. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 5%.
Steve will discuss our financial results momentarily, but we're pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, as we focus on pricing maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Strong execution of our Go Lean strategy in International is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, recognizing the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our International business.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're pleased with our top line performance. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year 2016, we remain committed to growing profitably through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating through our 3D brand-building approach, the value that our products provide consumers regardless of price point.
Factoring in our strong Q1 sales performance as well as our outlook for unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as stepped-up competitive pressure in the second half the year, we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016."

While we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter, we grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis.

While we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter, we grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we expanded our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all our U.S. business segments.
Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our first quarter, sales grew 3% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points. Sales results also reflected nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher trade promotion spending.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 45%, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at 13.4% of sales.
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was close to 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago period.
In total, demand building investments including trade promotion spending increased $13 million, reflecting support behind product innovation, which contributed to category growth and market share gains in the quarter.
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.32, a 20% increase versus a year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $107 million or about 8% of sales compared with $205 million in the year-ago quarter or about 15% of sales. Free cash flow in the first quarter was lower largely due to higher performance-based employee incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year 2015 results. Looking forward, we anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales.
In the first quarter, we repurchased about 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $112 million to offset stock option dilution. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong first quarter sales growth and slower growth rates in subsequent quarters.
Our sales outlook also takes into account the following factors: Ongoing investment behind our innovation program, which we continue to anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth for the full year; continued slowing international economies with about 3 points of impact from foreign currency declines. With the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we're closely monitory the possibility of worsening exchange rates in the balance of the fiscal year. And finally, in light of the positive momentum in our market shares, we're preparing to address potential heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year, particularly in key categories, including Bags and Wraps, Litter and Home Care.
Turning to margin. Previously, we had assumed gross margin would be flat for the full fiscal year. However, based on our strong first quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin to increase modestly or about 25 to 50 basis points. The benefit of cost savings, pricing and lower commodity costs are expected to be partially offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics cost. Other moderating factors include higher trade promotion spending and foreign currency declines. Importantly, we anticipate reinvesting a significant portion of the benefits realized from lower commodity cost to drive top line growth.
We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year '16. We also continue to anticipate EBIT margin to increase in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting modest gross margin expansion, moderated by incremental investments in consumer demand building programs and increased support behind our cost savings programs to fuel profitable growth.
We continue to anticipate our fiscal year '16 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of 34% to 35%. And net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate our fiscal year '16 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83.
Considering the strength of our first quarter results and our confidence in executing our strategy, we're cautiously optimistic about the possibility of being in the upper end of our outlook ranges for sales and earnings. However, it's still early in the year, and we need more time to see how the macroeconomic and competitive challenges unfold in the remainder of the fiscal year.
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate facing a more challenging second half. Nonetheless, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, particularly behind product innovation and our cost savings programs will continue to be priorities.
With that, I'll turn over to Benno."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. There are 3 things, we hope you'll takeaway from today's call: first, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work and that's reflected in our Q1 results; second, because our strategy is working, we're staying the course, investing in the business to drive profitable growth; and third, we continue to face pronounced headwinds in the balance of the year, and we've reflected that in our outlook. So let me summarize my perspective on these 3 areas.
First, our Q1 results are strong indicators our strategy is working. Some highlights include the fact that our U.S. business achieved the strongest sales growth in several years and delivered it across all segments. Further, while currency effects are real and cannot be dismissed, our International business delivered solid sales growth on a currency-neutral basis and saw positive results from our Go Lean strategy with solid profit growth in U.S. dollars as well as in local currencies.
In addition, strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand building investments, translated to category growth as well as the highest quarterly market share growth and our highest absolute U.S. market share in 3 years.
And our focus on profitable growth, supported by trade-up, cost savings and commodity tailwinds help drive meaningful margin expansion in the quarter with margin growth in all 4 segments, including International. So our strategy is continuing to work, and we're staying the course to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable.
In International, where our business remains challenged, in great part due to foreign currencies, much like every other U.S.-based company, I'm proud of the tough decisions our team has made to improve profitability across that business for our shareholders. In particular, I believe the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy: pricing, cost savings, rightsizing and optimizing demand spending, will pay off in the long term. I feel very good about the future of this business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.
Turning to the U.S. We have a robust innovation pipeline across our portfolio and we'll continue investing in the business and focusing on delivering strong value to consumers. Our domestic business is healthy, and we intend to continue supporting it with advertising and marketing communications, sales and trade promotion spending and strong retail execution. As many of you heard at our Analyst Meeting in early October, our analysis of traditional versus digital forms of brand building show that we're keenly focused on ROIs and ensuring our demand creation dollars work hard for us.
We feel good about where we are. At the same time, it's still very early in the year. As Steve Robb discussed, going forward, we will be monitoring foreign exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year and commodity costs, which remain volatile and tend to rise over time. All said, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, which is reflected in what I believe to be a balanced outlook.
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

Thank you for the question. We think we have a balanced outlook that certainly reflects the strength of our execution, but also, as you say, what we anticipate to be a tougher competitive environment in the back half, specifically as it relates to 3 categories. First, Home Care, where we've gained a lot of market share for 5 quarters now and typically, what happens is that, that will yield a stronger competitive reaction to that market share growth. In Cat Litter, as is very well known by now, we have innovation coming up in the back half and we think that that's going to increase the competitive activity in the category. And then in Glad, the third category, where we are expecting somewhat heightened competitive activity, commodities have been somewhat of a tailwind and we are investing in growth, reinvesting effectively much of that commodities goodness back in the business. So we expect that the competitive activity in these 3 categories is going to be heightened. We reflected that in our outlook. And as I said, we want to continue to stay in the driver's seat and invest in profitable growth."

And I think, what we've also said, which continues to be true is that we are committed to increasing our overall demand spend by 100 basis points or 1% of sales. So that all will remain on track. And certainly, what continues to be true is that we remain very committed to the spend in digital, where we're getting very strong returns. Digital will be up to north of 40% of our working media spend this year, up from 30% last year.

If you go back to fiscal '15, beginning in the fourth quarter, we saw commodity cost tailwinds, that continue straight to the first quarter, which came in as expected and I would expect that to continue through Q2. As we get into the second half of the fiscal year, 2 things we're going to monitor very closely: number one is just energy prices, because that can have an influencing impact; second is overseas markets, because it is a supply and demand market; and then third, production capacity appears to be somewhat tight depending on who you listen to and it doesn't take much of a supply disruption to cause those markets to move up quickly. So I think, we'll get tailwinds for the year. There'll be more in the first half than the second half. And we'll start to lap that as we move through the fiscal year."

But what we've also said is that we are seeing equally strong returns in our digital and social media spend, and we expect dollars to continue to flow in those 2 areas. So dollars will flow back and forth. I wouldn't read too much into what's happening in one quarter, but it is certainly true that, right now, our trade funds in support of our innovation are particularly effective."

So we're certainly coming off a very strong first quarter results and it just seems prudent to us to take some of that strength and invest it back behind these innovation programs and consumer demand building programs that we have.

When we went into this year, we thought foreign currency headwinds would be about 3-point drag on top line sales. If you just looked at the U.S. dollar spot rates today, they are a bit worse than we have thought. And so that certainly something we're watching closely, and we're expecting a significant devaluation in Argentina. So I do think the International business is probably going to continue to face a tough situation over the next couple of quarters, which is why again, what we're trying to do is focus on innovation in that business, focus on driving cost savings, leveraging our U.S. capabilities and really take targeted pricing where we can get it.

Turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective and open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable and consistent growth are working.
On the top line, in Q1, volume and sales were each up 3%. Despite about 3 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and slightly higher trade spending in support of in-store merchandising, sales grew solidly, reflecting the benefit of about 2 points of pricing and slightly favorable mix. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 6%.
All of our U.S. businesses grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis.
In the U.S., 13-week market shares increased 0.5 point versus the year-ago quarter to 23.8%. This is the highest quarterly gain as well as the highest absolute market share since the conversion 3 years ago to the broader MULO reporting format. It's rewarding to see our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing opportunities paying off in stronger market share. More specifically, 6 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal.
In addition to market share improvement, driving improved category trends remains a top priority for us. And during the quarter, our categories were up 1.8 points, slightly lower than recent quarters but still very healthy.
With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume increased 5% and sales grew 6%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly. The gain was driven by growth in all segments of our Home Care business with Clorox branded products performing well and particular strength in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes during the back-to-school season as well as behind our new wipe products, which have been supported by advertising and strong retail merchandising execution. As noted a moment ago, Home Care was a key contributor to our strong market share growth and has now achieved more than 5 quarters of market share gains.
Heading into our second quarter, we are closely watching this fall's cold and flu trends, which have been relatively muted so far and recognize we'll also be lapping strong growth in the year-ago quarter in our Professional Products Healthcare business due to Ebola and enterovirus concerns last year. That said, our Q1 results demonstrate that our Home Care business is on solid ground.
Laundry business sales also increased in the quarter, driven in part by the benefit of an earlier Clorox Bleach price increase. From a market share standpoint, our overall bleach share dipped slightly in the quarter after 6 consecutive quarters of share growth. At the same time, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less bleach products, which are trade up from our regular product.
Splash-less bleach is performing very well with the market share and segment that is higher than our share in the regular bleach segment. In addition, Splash-less bleach is adding Household penetration at the expense of private label, as we drive growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
In our Household segment, we delivered 1% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Bags and Wraps and our Charcoal business. In Bags and Wraps, sales were up mid-single digits behind innovation in premium trash bags as well as a price increase taken in late calendar year 2014. Similar to my comments on the bleach business, where we are benefiting from growth on higher-margin Splash-less bleach, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings.
Following a number of new scent offerings, new Glad OdorShield trash bags with the scent of Gain have been particularly successful, supported by advertising and strong digital marketing. Further, we look forward to sharing with you additional innovation in the Glad's premium trash bag segment as part of our next quarter's discussion.
In the Charcoal business, sales also grew strongly and frankly, much stronger-than-anticipated due to promotions, consumption and outstanding retail execution behind the U.S. Labor Day holiday. In the quarter, we were lapping double-digit growth a year ago. So we were very pleased to deliver strong results on top of that. There is some risk, especially given the wet El Niño weather pattern being forecast, the consumption will slow, particularly following last year's mid-single-digit growth. While weather may temper near-term results, our Charcoal business is clearly performing very well.
Turning to Cat Litter, while our volume declined in this competitive category, Q1 sales increased behind the performance of our lightweight products. While competition in this category will remain intense over the next several quarters, we're looking forward to the launch of new Fresh Step with Febreze in calendar year 2016, which will make us stronger competitively.
In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 8% and sales grew 7%, with volume and sales improving in all 3 business units: Food, Burt's Bees and Brita. Our food business performed strongly behind our ranch with bottled salad dressing such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic as well as our Dry Hidden Valley dressing and Dip Mixes, such as Greek Yogurt.
On our Burt's Bees business, volume and sales grew double digits, largely due to innovation in face-care products as well as the earlier timing of holiday shipments.
Facial towelettes also continued to perform very strongly. Burt's Bees now holds the #4 market share position in the Lip Crayon category, an impressive positon recognizing the crayon category includes both conventional and natural offerings, such as Burt's Bees.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business. Our strategy to drive trial of pour-through systems showed encouraging results in Q1, delivering mid-single-digit volume and sales growth behind strong execution during the back-to-school period and incremental distribution gains in e-commerce.
Turning to International. Volume was -- volume for the quarter was flat, whereas sales declined 8%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially across all markets. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 5%.
Steve will discuss our financial results momentarily, but we're pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, as we focus on pricing maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Strong execution of our Go Lean strategy in International is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, recognizing the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our International business.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're pleased with our top line performance. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year 2016, we remain committed to growing profitably through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating through our 3D brand-building approach, the value that our products provide consumers regardless of price point.
Factoring in our strong Q1 sales performance as well as our outlook for unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as stepped-up competitive pressure in the second half the year, we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016."
89450,313048382,889615,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter, we grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we expanded our margins",849,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter, we grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we expanded our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all our U.S. business segments.
Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our first quarter, sales grew 3% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points. Sales results also reflected nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher trade promotion spending.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 45%, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at 13.4% of sales.
Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was close to 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago period.
In total, demand building investments including trade promotion spending increased $13 million, reflecting support behind product innovation, which contributed to category growth and market share gains in the quarter.
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.32, a 20% increase versus a year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $107 million or about 8% of sales compared with $205 million in the year-ago quarter or about 15% of sales. Free cash flow in the first quarter was lower largely due to higher performance-based employee incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year 2015 results. Looking forward, we anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales.
In the first quarter, we repurchased about 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $112 million to offset stock option dilution. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong first quarter sales growth and slower growth rates in subsequent quarters.
Our sales outlook also takes into account the following factors: Ongoing investment behind our innovation program, which we continue to anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth for the full year; continued slowing international economies with about 3 points of impact from foreign currency declines. With the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we're closely monitoring the possibility of worsening exchange rates in the balance of the fiscal year. And finally, in light of the positive momentum in our market shares, we're preparing to address potential heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year, particularly in key categories, including Bags and Wraps, Litter and Home Care.
Turning to margin. Previously, we had assumed gross margin would be flat for the full fiscal year. However, based on our strong first quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin to increase modestly or about 25 to 50 basis points. The benefit of cost savings, pricing and lower commodity costs are expected to be partially offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics cost. Other moderating factors include higher trade promotion spending and foreign currency declines. Importantly, we anticipate reinvesting a significant portion of the benefits realized from lower commodity cost to drive top line growth.
We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year '16. We also continue to anticipate EBIT margin to increase in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting modest gross margin expansion, moderated by incremental investments in consumer demand building programs and increased support behind our cost savings programs to fuel profitable growth.
We continue to anticipate our fiscal year '16 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of 34% to 35%. And net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate our fiscal year '16 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83.
Considering the strength of our first quarter results and our confidence in executing our strategy, we're cautiously optimistic about the possibility of being in the upper end of our outlook ranges for sales and earnings. However, it's still early in the year, and we need more time to see how the macroeconomic and competitive challenges unfold in the remainder of the fiscal year.
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate facing a more challenging second half. Nonetheless, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, particularly behind product innovation and our cost savings programs will continue to be priorities.
With that, I'll turn over to Benno."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. There are 3 things we hope you'll takeaway from today's call: first, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work and that's reflected in our Q1 results; second, because our strategy is working, we're staying the course, investing in the business to drive profitable growth; and third, we continue to face pronounced headwinds in the balance of the year, and we've reflected that in our outlook. So let me summarize my perspective on these 3 areas.
First, our Q1 results are strong indicators our strategy is working. Some highlights include the fact that our U.S. business achieved the strongest sales growth in several years and delivered it across all segments. Further, while currency effects are real and cannot be dismissed, our International business delivered solid sales growth on a currency-neutral basis and saw positive results from our Go Lean strategy with solid profit growth in U.S. dollars as well as in local currencies.
In addition, strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand building investments, translated to category growth as well as the highest quarterly market share growth and our highest absolute U.S. market share in 3 years.
And our focus on profitable growth, supported by trade-up, cost savings and commodity tailwinds help drive meaningful margin expansion in the quarter with margin growth in all 4 segments, including International. So our strategy is continuing to work, and we're staying the course to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable.
In International, where our business remains challenged, in great part due to foreign currencies, much like every other U.S.-based company, I'm proud of the tough decisions our team has made to improve profitability across that business for our shareholders. In particular, I believe the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy: pricing, cost savings, rightsizing and optimizing demand spending, will pay off in the long term. I feel very good about the future of this business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.
Turning to the U.S. We have a robust innovation pipeline across our portfolio and we'll continue investing in the business and focusing on delivering strong value to consumers. Our domestic business is healthy, and we intend to continue supporting it with advertising and marketing communications, sales and trade promotion spending and strong retail execution. As many of you heard at our Analyst Meeting in early October, our analysis of traditional versus digital forms of brand building show that we're keenly focused on ROIs and ensuring our demand creation dollars work hard for us.
We feel good about where we are. At the same time, it's still very early in the year. As Steve Robb discussed, going forward, we will be monitoring foreign exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year and commodity costs, which remain volatile and tend to rise over time. All said, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, which is reflected in what I believe to be a balanced outlook.
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

Thank you for the question. We think we have a balanced outlook that certainly reflects the strength of our execution, but also, as you say, what we anticipate to be a tougher competitive environment in the back half, specifically as it relates to 3 categories. First, Home Care, where we've gained a lot of market share for 5 quarters now and typically, what happens is that, that will yield a stronger competitive reaction to that market share growth. In Cat Litter, as is very well known by now, we have innovation coming up in the back half and we think that that's going to increase the competitive activity in the category. And then in Glad, the third category, where we are expecting somewhat heightened competitive activity, commodities have been somewhat of a tailwind and we are investing in growth, reinvesting effectively much of that commodities goodness back in the business. So we expect that the competitive activity in these 3 categories is going to be heightened. We reflected that in our outlook. And as I said, we want to continue to stay in the driver's seat and invest in profitable growth."

And I think, what we've also said, which continues to be true is that we are committed to increasing our overall demand spend by 100 basis points or 1% of sales. So that all will remain on track. And certainly, what continues to be true is that we remain very committed to the spend in digital, where we're getting very strong returns.

But here's what we would say, we certainly expect to get commodity cost tailwinds this fiscal year and most of that will be driven by resin. And I also think, it'll over index in the first half of the fiscal. If you go back to fiscal '15, beginning in the fourth quarter, we saw commodity cost tailwinds, that continue straight through the first quarter, which came in as expected and I would expect that to continue through Q2. As we get into the second half of the fiscal year, 2 things we're going to monitor very closely: number one is just energy prices, because that can have an influencing impact; second is overseas markets, because it is a supply and demand market; and then third, production capacity appears to be somewhat tight depending on who you listen to and it doesn't take much of a supply disruption to cause those markets to move up quickly. So I think, we'll get tailwinds for the year. There'll be more in the first half than the second half. And we'll start to lap that as we move through the fiscal year."

I think, as Benno and Steve had pointed out in their opening comments, historically, when you build market share the way we have consistently quarter-after-quarter, the competition tends to come back a bit stronger. So we're certainly coming off a very strong first quarter results and it just seems prudent to us to take some of that strength and invest it back behind these innovation programs and consumer demand building programs that we have. And so that's really what we're signaling. We have yet to see another leg up in the competitive set, but as you know, these tend to run in 6-month window.

When we went into this year, we thought foreign currency headwinds would be about 3-point drag on top line sales. If you just looked at the U.S. dollar spot rates today, they are a bit worse than we have thought. And so that certainly something we're watching closely, and we're expecting a significant devaluation in Argentina. So I do think the International business is probably going to continue to face a tough situation over the next couple of quarters, which is why again, what we're trying to do is focus on innovation in that business, focus on driving cost savings, leveraging our U.S. capabilities and really take targeted pricing where we can get it.
