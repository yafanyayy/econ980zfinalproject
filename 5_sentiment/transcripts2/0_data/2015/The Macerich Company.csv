We'll be updating much of that information for you today, as well as our view on 2015. 
Consistent with past practice, we will be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time, and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me, Art, John Perry or Jean. 
It was another very strong quarter for us across the board. We continue to see strong operating results. Leasing spreads for good and leasing volumes were very significant. We signed leases on 516,000 square feet of space that compared to 330,000 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2014. The releasing spreads were positive 22%. 
Mall occupancy was at 95.8%, that's up 125 basis points from a year ago. Looking at that stat on a same-center basis, we were up 70 basis points from 95.1% at 12/31/13. 
Temporary occupancy was 5.1% of that occupancy compared to 5.8% at December 31 of last year, it was down about 70 basis points from a year ago, but we still have a lot of progress to make on that front, and that we continue to be in focus for 
us. Average mall store base rents are now over $50 a foot, they increased to $51.15, up 6% from $48.16 a year ago. 
Looking at FFO for the quarter. Reported FFO was $0.99 compared to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of last year. Reflected in FFO was a $9.1 million early extinguishment of debt penalty, $0.06 a share. That was an early payoff of Vintage Faire in Fresno Fashion Fair loans, which were combined $250 million and had an average interest rate of 6.2%. We arranged a new $280 million, 3.49%, 11-year fixed-rate loan to be placed on Vintage Faire, essentially replacing that debt that we paid off. In Fresno, we remain unencumbered for now. 
Excluding the prepayment penalty we came in at $1.05 for the quarter, right in the middle of our guidance range. 
Impacting net income for the quarter but not FFO was a $1.5 billion remeasurement gain that is recorded for accounting purposes as a result of converting our ownership of Queens Lakewood Los Cerritos, Stonewood and Washington Square from an unconsolidated 51% to a consolidated 100%. 
We gained as essentially a value of our 51% interest at the date of our transaction less our book basis. 
Same-center NOI for the quarter increased by 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive releasing of spreads, annual CPI increases and leases. We think, however, it's more meaningful to look at a full year same-center NOI. For the year ended December 31, 2014, same-center NOI growth was 4.24%. 
During the fourth quarter, we had stronger occupancy lease term revenue and percentage rents than we had forecast. 
Term fees are included in the same-center NOI as they are a recurring part of our business and unlike straight-line rents, it is a cash revenue. It can cause some quarterly fluctuation as it relates to same center NOI growth, and that's why we feel it's more meaningful to look at a 12-month calculation for that metric or at least a year-to-date calculation. 
For lease terminations for the year, it came in at $11.8 million, that was only slightly higher than our guidance level of $10 million, and, in fact, our average annual lease termination revenues over the past 5 years has averaged $9.6 million. 
We had a $2.6 million gain on landfill during the quarter and offsetting that gain and included in REIT G&A cost were $3 million worth of transaction costs related to the acquisition activity in the fourth quarter, and that is included in REIT G&A and caused the increase to $12.1 million in total. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was $700,000, that compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year and as a result of refinancing activity and the interest rate environment we've been, average interest rate is down to 3.5% compared to 4.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. We had the strongest balance sheet in the history of our company. At quarter end, some of the balance sheet metrics included debt-to-market cap at 33%, interest coverage ratio of 3.8x, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis 7.2x, average debt maturity, 5.2 years and floating rate debt as a percentage of total REIT debt is 17%. 
We continue to see a great financing environment given our ability to borrow at attractive rates. As I mentioned, we paid off Fresno Fashion Fair and Vintage Faire early and secured a very attractive 3.49% financing on Vintage Fair, that's an 11-year fixed-rate term. 
We also had some other attractive financing opportunities ahead of us this year, including Lakewood Mall, which is very underleveraged and currently carries a 5.43% interest rate; and Washington Square, which has a 6.02% coupon. 
Those should be financed later this year no doubt at substantial savings. 
In this morning's press release, we also gave FFO guidance, the range is $3.80 to $3.90 per share. There seems no asset sales in 2015. It does include dilution of about $0.10 a share from the assets we sold in 2014. It reflects a same-center NOI growth rate of 4.25% to 4.75%. We are seeing the benefit of proving that we did to our portfolio 2013 and '14, and that's reflected in this assumption and our expectation of seeing accelerating same center NOI growth. 
The guidance assumes $10 million of lease termination revenue, just slightly less than actual of $11.8 million this year. There's been no acquisitions factored into that guidance and there's been no gain or loss and early extinguishment of debt factored into the guidance. And you can see that guidance -- those guidance assumptions detailed in our supplement. 
And again, looking at the quarterly split on the FFO guidance, the first quarter is expected to be 21%; second quarter, 24%; third quarter, 25%; and the fourth quarter, 30%. 
Looking at temp sales for a moment. Total portfolio sales per foot for the year were $587, that compared to $562 last year. 
If you look at that calculation of same-center basis, it was $587 compared to $574. The top regions for us were Arizona and Southern California, and if we take a look at total sales for the period of the quarter ended December 31, 2014, total sales were up 2.2%. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

First of all, I would like to briefly address the speculation in the market regarding Simon Property Group's Investment and Macerich. As you likely know in November, 2014, Simon announced that it had acquired a stake in our company. At this point, there is really nothing more that we can share with you. It's our policy not to comment on market rumors or speculation, and we do not intend to make any further comments or statements during this call regarding Simon. 
With that, I want to remind you that all of the purpose of today's call is to discuss our fourth quarter and full year's earnings results, as well as our outlook for 2015. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on these topics. 
Turning now to the results for 2014. As Tom has outlined for you, it was a terrific year for a company. It was a transformational but it was certainly an evolutionary year where many important benchmarks were reached. 
From an operating viewpoint, we put up some very good numbers with occupancy levels increasing, leasing was extremely strong, the environment is extremely good. Our spreads remained very, very good during the year, up 22% for the trailing 12 months. 
As Tom outlined for you, our balance sheet is in terrific shape, and we see the opportunity over the next 18 months to even further enhance it with some very opportunistic refinancing opportunities coming up available to us. 
Development, we have some significant milestones during the year, some great accomplishments on portfolio management. 
As we look at the development activities during the course of 2014 and our outlook for 2015, again, we have some very good milestones. The Tysons, our office tower, is now over 80% leased. The residential towers leasing up extremely well and the hotel is poised open here later on the end of this quarter, the beginning of next. 
At Scottsdale Fashion Square, as well as Cerritos, we're well underway at the construction to add 2 new junior anchors at each of them, a sporting goods operator Dick's a teach of them and a major theater complex at each of them. 
Speaking of theaters, the theater at Santa Monica, Place, construction there is going along well with an opening that are anticipated here in the later on in the third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year, coupled with the second generation releasing of the center, that theater is already spawning significant renewed interest into the center, particularly into the third level. 
Looking to the third level of the property, for example, we recently signed and are actually under construction on the recycling of some existing restaurant space into new Cheesecake Factory, which we think is terrific here in this market. 
We also have new major tenant such as UNIQLO that has replaced Love Culture, and I'm sure there may be other retailers in Santa Monica Place that Bob may point out to you that we have either recycled or are recycling, all with a view towards really taking the center up to a very significant level improvement in the productivity. 
At Broadway Plaza, we had a terrific first part of our expansion there with the demolition and complete reconstruction of a parking deck that was contiguous to Nordstrom. This was necessary to create the footprint for the expansion of Broadway Plaza. That was done and completed all within 6 or 7 months, which is really terrific. 
At Fashion Outlets at Niagara, our expansion opened up on schedule, on budget, well leased, well over 85% leased. 
At Kings Plaza, our remodel and remerchandising is going tremendously well and we're moving along very well on our entitlements at The Gallery. 
From a portfolio management viewpoint, we further recycled out of our couple of lower productivity centers and into some high productivity properties. With the disposition of the assets that we sold in 2014, we then turn around, during the course of the year, increased our ownership of Fashion Outlets of Chicago to 100% and also to 100% in 5 malls in the Ontario transaction. 
Another key investment that we made during the year, obviously, was The Gallery in Philadelphia, and we're very bullish about that. 
As I look forward to 2015 and beyond, the company is extremely well poised as a result of our portfolio management that we have done over the previous 3 or 4 years, we have our balance sheet is well positioned to finance all of our activities here going forward. The leasing outlook is terrific. As I look at upcoming development activities that we have and new ones that we've announced, we announced a couple of months ago our joint venture to build a 500,000 square-foot outlet center at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. demand for that center from the retailers' viewpoint has been very significant, we're very bullish on that. 
At Green Acres, we moved that project up to our active development pipeline. That is really the expansion of our retail campus. We're adding 335,000 square feet of restaurants, pads, as well as operators such asked Dick's, HomeGoods, Ashley Furniture and others. We're very optimistic about the impact that, that's going to have to the retail campus. This is a center that you may remember that when we bought it a couple of years ago, it's doing $500 a square foot. Today, it's doing over $575 a square foot. Leasing activity in the mall has been very dramatic. The expansion of the retail campus, we think, is going to be even further enhanced the retail destination. We think that it largely caused the campus to exceed $1 billion in sales over the years to come. 
And we anticipate the announcement of a new anchor that will be attached in part of the enclosed mall itself in the very near term. 
A new project that's in our -- that we've talked about that is now in our shadow pipeline is the further densification of Scottsdale Fashion Square. As you think of Scottsdale somewhere in the same context that you think about Tysons Corner, so a huge retail project,and we're blessed that Scottsdale to have excess land that is going to enable us to further densify that property. Again, we talked about the expansion of the property that's currently underway and this densification, we think, will further enhance the retail destination. 
Speaking of the destination, at the Super Bowl this last week, the NFL had their fans, had an activity at Scottsdale Fashion Square on the 7 acres of vacant land that we have outlined as densification opportunities, and we generated over 0.5 million visitors to that project during the course of the 4, 5 days leading up and into the Super Bowl, and it was very dramatic in terms of the traffic increases and the sales increases that we enjoyed. 
At Tysons Corner, we are underway with perfecting the next phase of entitlements, and that's really spun by the confidence that we have, in the leasing activities that we have, particularly in the residential side. 
We anticipate that at The Gallery in Philadelphia that we will be in a position to announce joint REIT with our Penn REIT. The scope of the project, the size of the dollars, as well as the incremental returns over the next quarter or so. 
At Chicago in Northbridge, it was announced during the quarter that we acquired a square block contiguous to across the street from Nordstrom, which is either the #1 or #2 Nordstrom store in the United States in terms of sale volume. 
And that square block was acquired. It's about 65,000 square feet of building area. We see that we will have opportunities to integrate that into the Upper Michigan Avenue with the opportunity to have FAR on that side of about 780,000 square feet, we're in early planning phases on that project. Likely outcome will be that we would do the retail and anything that go vertical above that, we'll most likely be on air rights deal with other folks doing that development. 
Another significant activity that happened somewhat in the development arena that will affect us in this year and next year is that Sears announced that they, along with Macerich through our cooperation -- Sears announced that they are going to bifurcate their stores at Freehold and Danbury, 2 of our great centers where Sears will occupy 1 level of their two-level store, consolidate and rationalize into that, and they have sub-let the other level of their anchors store to Primark. We think it's a great addition to each of those centers, high traffic generator, and we are happy to cooperate with Sears as they make their deal with Primark, and they will be responsible for our capital connection with that edition. 
As I think about 2015 and beyond from an operating viewpoint, I take great confidence in the same center results that we've had in the previous year. The outlook that we have for this year and beyond, you may remember at our Investor Day that the Tom outlined a footprint for you as to how he felt and we feel that we'll able to achieve over the next 5 years range of same-center NOI, but we generally land at the midpoint of our around 4.5%. We're very confident given our outlook for the future, as well as financial modeling, as well as just the retailer environment that, that type of same-center NOI growth is available to us. 
With that, I would like to open it up for Q&A, operator."

The rail station has 2 stops, near major retail centers 1 across the street from Bloomingdale's in Santa Monica. The other one 1 block away from Westside Pavilion. But it's a center that we've really still needs to be reimagined. We think there are densification opportunities there. We've had a significant number of developers and users in the area, come an d talk to us about that opportunity, particularly as it relates to office and residential. We're going to be debating that and taking that through. But to pave the way for the future there, we are already beginning to de-lease, a short-term lease, the retailers that we have there. The center, at last report was doing around $350 a square foot, which is not on all in keeping with its potential. So we were in early stages of reimagining the center, and we anticipate that over the few years or so we'll be getting some entitlements to make that possible. But this is a situation where we will have some significant positioning of the center for the ultimate repositioning of it. We don't  have anything clear cut to outline today, other than it's not what it should be. It's a great location, and we're convinced that 5 years from now, it will be significantly better and more profitable and productive than where it is today."

Just a start with last year probably the 3 most significant store closures or were Love Culture, Coldwater and Juicy and represented about 27 stores on our portfolio. Generally, the stores were located in some of our better centers so the real estate was strong. We have, as we sit today, about 62% of that has been released in terms of signed leases or deals that have been approved by both the tenant and the landlord and are in documentation. So we picked up about 2/3 of it. In terms of economics, we're looking at above, high mid-single digit increase in total occupancy cost, so there is a reasonably good pickup. But one of the key elements for us is an improvement in quality in terms of bringing in more productive retailers, so go give you a sense, some of the new tenants we brought into ourself space include Soft Surrounding, Anthropology, H&M, Boston Proper, Soma, Aviva, Anderson, St. John's, Bear Bradley, Karen, Kiehl's Godiva, Pandora and UNIQLO. So we've really been able to upgrade the merchandise mix significantly because of the ability to reclaim the real estate and combine that with some update and rentals. In terms of the 2015 bankruptcies, a couple of comments. The 5 retailers that have been the most significant include Westfield, Body Central, Shop, Delius and Cash A. The comment that I would make is none of these bankruptcies came in as a surprise. These are all of retailers who have been struggling for many years. Their sales with our portfolio averaged $212 a foot, our centers are just under $600 a foot. So we plan, in terms of our budgets and our 2015 forecast, these store closures. And again, we believe it will present an opportunity to bring in more productive retailers, who ultimately will pay more rent."

The overall number were occupancy neutral, but we're expecting to continue to reduce the amount of temporary occupancy we have. As I said, it was 5.1% at year-end and our goal is to take that down between 50 and 100 basis points. We typically double the rent we achieve when we can convert the space from temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. I think your other question had to do with lease termination payments in the fourth quarter. We had an active fourth quarter leasing front that. It was also fairly active in terms of generating termination payments. That wasn't from any one tenant. We did get a decent size termination payment from juicy, But then there were off quite a few others. And again, as I mentioned, that's a fairly normal number for us. The year came in at $11.8 million, we averaged $9.6 million over the course, annually, over the course of the last 5 years. Our guidance in 2015 is again includes $10 million is our assumption for that. The piece that hit in the fourth quarter that related to the same center pool, which I think was another part of your question, was $5 million. That compared to about $600,000 last year. But again, that's one reason we look at that statistics on an annual basis rather than quarter is. The lease termination revenue and there's a cost for that because you give up occupancy so it hurts your NOI in another way, although it benefits you in terms of getting that cash compensation upfront. We really think that's a statistic we have to take a trailing 12 months number, a full year number to really have a meaningful look at what's going on there in terms of same-center growth."

But conversely, if you think about our more international sort of centers, centers such as Santa Monica Place, centers such as Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner and Fashion Outlets of Chicago. Fashion Outlets of Chicago, sales are on fire. Traffic is up 30-some percent this week versus last year for the last 3 or 4 months. Santa Monica Place, traffic and sales are very, very robust. Same is true at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner. So I mean those are centers that I think of that benefit from international tourism.

How do you think of all the redevelopment and all the capital that's going into the market as far as -- do you envision that each center is going to focus on a different shopper point? Or is it simply because of the traffic these shopper rings are very tied to each center and therefore, there's not as much competition as all these different entities reinvesting their assets?"

So let's first of all, keep in mind that there are 4, or 5 or 6 major retail centers in Southern California that are under a significant either redevelopment or about to be redeveloped. They're generally all in extremely good locations. They're in unbelievably higher buyer entry locations. They're generally all in the middle of wonderful demographic. But all of the names that you just mentioned, I do think that the growth Beverly Center, Century City, Santa Monica Place and even Delano, they're all kind chasing the shape of the same customer. And they all realized opportunity or an Westside Pavilion to distinguish itself and not to chase that same customer. We have a wonderful demographic and a very, very it's a really high dense well of fluent and educated population in the immediate area of Westside. And then you have the impact of the rail, which is going to give access to Westside, all the way from Santa Monica to downtown L.A. And we see people using the rail. They can go to Westside from both directions. Landmark is one of the -- theaters is one of the top 2 independent film theater venues in the United States. So we see this as a great opportunity. And as you think about the 4 or 5 developments, really, and remember they're all redevelopments, not new supply, it's really generally recycling supply. Remember, it's in the middle of a market that is the ninth largest economy in the world. So it's mainly just getting put in to a pretty vibrant economy."

Tom, you spoke about some of the refinancings that you have upcoming. But just if you step back and just look up your debt schedule, you got a meaningful amount of debt that's floating at the time when interest rates aren't that all-time lows, although we all say that, and then they go lower. But at the same time, your duration or the maturity is only about 5 years. So what are you thinking as you look out over the next year of activity, where do you think that maturity average is going to go? And on the floating rate that's out there, what are ways that you can bring that down to lock in today's rates?"

For one thing, if you finance every asset yield for 10 years, it's your average maturity would be?. It would be [indiscernible] so that's what we've been doing, and that's pretty much the normal level. The floating rate debt is temporarily high because we paid off Vintage Faire and Fresno right before year-end that we used our line. So when we financed Vintage Faire on March 1, that's going to go straight to the reduced [indiscernible] debt so that will flip right there. So you've seen as being extremely active in the financing market. If you look at our maturity schedule, it's very attractive in terms of how it's evenly layered out as you get past sha you look at 2019, that's the highest level about $700 million in maturities. Everything else is under that. Going all the way out to 2025. That's why we picked 11 years for Vintage Faire. That's round it to 2026. And then the 2016 bucket, which looks somewhat higher rate is going to be reduced for when the refinance Washington Square, we'll probably go out 10 or 11 years on that. And then our line of credit in 2018, it causes that year to be a little bit lumpy, but we're going to continue to go along when it's available and I think you're going to see the floating rate debt come down fairly significantly just as a matter of refinancing some of these assets we've been talking about."

And we're constantly thinking about development opportunities and redevelopment opportunities. So the whole purpose of that -- one of the major purposes of the portfolio management on selling assets was to enable us to have the capital to profitably move from slower, growing, less productive assets and to plow it into proven winners, but also to have the management to focus in time to think about fewer opportunities with bigger opportunities and really to focus on great redevelopment.

There will be -- there's one that there's in addition of a new specialty anchor that will be coming at a quarter [indiscernible] in the next month or 2 that we'll be talking about, not a huge capital spend.

It was another very strong quarter for us, across the board, we continue to see strong operating results. Leasing spreads were good and leasing volumes were very significant. We signed leases on 516,000 square feet of space, that compared to 330,000 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2013. The re-leasing spreads were positive 22%.
Mall occupancy was at 95.8%, that's up 125 basis points from a year ago. Looking at that stat on a same-center basis, we were up 70 basis points from 95.1% at 12/31/13.
Temporary occupancy was 5.1% of that occupancy compared to 5.8% at December 31 of last year, so down about 70 basis points from a year ago, but we still have a lot of progress to make on that front, and that will continue to be a focus for us. Average mall store base rents are now over $50 a foot. They increased to $51.15, up 6% from $48.16 a year ago.
Looking at FFO for the quarter. Reported FFO was $0.99 compared to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of last year. Reflected in FFO was a $9.1 million early extinguishment of debt penalty, $0.06 a share. That was on the early payoff of Vintage Faire and Fresno Fashion Fair loans, which were a combined $250 million and had an average interest rate of 6.2%. We arranged a new $280 million, 3.49%, 11-year fixed-rate loan to be placed on Vintage Faire, essentially replacing that debt that we paid off. In Fresno, we remain unencumbered for now.
Excluding the prepayment penalty, we came in at $1.05 for the quarter, right in the middle of our guidance range.
Impacting net income for the quarter but not FFO was a $1.5 billion remeasurement gain that is recorded for accounting purposes as a result of converting our ownership of Queens, Lakewood, Los Cerritos, Stonewood and Washington Square from an unconsolidated 51% to a consolidated 100%.
We gained essentially the value of our 51% interest at the date of the transaction less our book basis.
Same-center NOI for the quarter increased by 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive releasing spreads, annual CPI increases on leases. We think, however, it's more meaningful to look at a full year same-center NOI. For the year ended December 31, 2014, same-center NOI growth was 4.24%.
During the fourth quarter, we had stronger occupancy lease term revenue and percentage rents than we had forecast.
Term fees are included in same-center NOI as they are a recurring part of our business and unlike straight-line rents, it is a cash revenue. It can cause some quarterly fluctuation as it relates to same-center NOI growth, and that's why we feel it's more meaningful to look at a 12-month calculation for that metric or at least a year-to-date calculation.
For lease terminations for the year, it came in at $11.8 million, that was only slightly higher than our guidance level of $10 million, and, in fact, our average annual lease termination revenues over the past 5 years has averaged $9.6 million.
We had a $2.6 million gain on landfill during the quarter, and offsetting that gain and included in REIT G&A cost were $3 million worth of transaction costs related to the acquisition activity in the fourth quarter. And that is included in REIT G&A and caused the increase to $12.1 million in total.
Bad debt expense for the quarter was $700,000, that compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. And as a result of refinancing activity and the interest rate environment we've been in, our average interest rate is down to 3.5% compared to 4.2% in the fourth quarter of last year.
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. We have the strongest balance sheet in the history of our company. At quarter end, some of the balance sheet metrics included: debt-to-market cap at 33%; interest coverage ratio of 3.8x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.2 years; and floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt is 17%.
We continue to see a great financing environment given our ability to borrow at attractive rates. As I mentioned, we paid off Fresno Fashion Fair and Vintage Faire early and secured a very attractive 3.49% financing on Vintage Faire, that's an 11-year fixed-rate term.
We also had some other attractive financing opportunities ahead of us this year, including Lakewood Mall, which is very underleveraged and currently carries a 5.43% interest rate; and Washington Square, which has a 6.02% coupon.
Those will be financed later this year, no doubt, at substantial savings.
In this morning's press release, we also gave FFO guidance. The range is $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This assumes no asset sales in 2015. It does include dilution of about $0.10 a share from the assets we sold in 2014. It reflects a same-center NOI growth rate of 4.25% to 4.75%. We are seeing the benefit of the pruning that we did to our portfolio in 2013 and '14, and that's reflected in this assumption and our expectation of seeing accelerating same-center NOI growth.
The guidance assumes $10 million of lease termination revenue, just slightly less than actual of $11.8 million this year. There's been no acquisitions factored into that guidance and there's been no gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt factored into the guidance. And you can see that guidance -- those guidance assumptions detailed in our supplement.
Again, looking at the quarterly split on the FFO guidance: the first quarter is expected to be 21%; second quarter, 24%; third quarter, 25%; and the fourth quarter, 30%.
Looking at tenant sales for a moment. Total portfolio sales per foot for the year were $587, that compared to $562 last year.
If you look at that calculation on a same-center basis, it was $587 compared to $574. The top regions for us were Arizona and Southern California, and if we take a look at total sales for the period of the quarter ended December 31, 2014, total sales were up 2.2%.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

First of all, I would like to briefly address the speculation in the market regarding Simon Property Group's investment in Macerich. As you likely know, in November 2014, Simon announced that it had acquired a stake in our company. At this point, there is really nothing more that we can share with you. It's our policy not to comment on market rumors or speculation, and we do not intend to make any further comments or statements during this call regarding Simon.
With that, I want to remind you all that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our fourth quarter and full year's earnings results as well as our outlook for 2015. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on these topics.
Turning now to the results for 2014. As Tom has outlined for you, it was a terrific year for our company. It wasn't transformational but it was certainly an evolutionary year, where many important benchmarks were reached.
From an operating viewpoint, we put up some very good numbers, with occupancy levels increasing, leasing was extremely strong, the environment is extremely good. Our spreads remained very, very good during the year, up 22% for the trailing 12 months.
As Tom outlined for you, our balance sheet is in terrific shape, and we see the opportunity in the next 18 months to even further enhance it with some very opportunistic refinancing opportunities coming up available to us.
Development, we have some significant milestones during the year, some great accomplishments on portfolio management.
As we look at the development activities during the course of 2014 and our outlook for 2015, again, we have some very good milestones. The Tysons, our office tower, is now over 80% leased. The residential tower's leasing up extremely well and the hotel is poised to open here later on the end of this quarter, the beginning of next.
At Scottsdale Fashion Square, as well as Cerritos, we're well underway on construction to add 2 new junior anchors at each of them, a sporting goods operator, DICK'S, at each of them and a major theater complex, Harkins, at each of them.
Speaking of theaters, the theater at Santa Monica Place, construction there is going along well, with an opening there anticipated here in the -- later on in the third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year. Coupled with the second generation releasing of the center, that theater is already spawning significant renewed interest into the center, particularly into the third level.
Looking to the third level of the property, for example, we recently signed and are actually under construction on the recycling of some existing restaurant space into a new Cheesecake Factory, which we think will be terrific here in this market.
We also have new major tenant such as UNIQLO that has replaced Love Culture, and I'm sure there may be other retailers at Santa Monica Place that Bob may point out to you that we have either recycled or are recycling, all with a view towards really taking this center up to a very significant level of improvement in the productivity.
At Broadway Plaza, we had a terrific first part of our expansion there with the demolition and complete reconstruction of a parking deck that was contiguous to Nordstrom. This was necessary to create the footprint for the expansion of Broadway Plaza. That was done and completed all within 6 or 7 months, which is really terrific.
At Fashion Outlets at Niagara, our expansion opened up on schedule, on budget, well leased, well over 85% leased.
At Kings Plaza, our remodel and remerchandising is going tremendously well, and we're moving along very well on our entitlements at The Gallery.
From a portfolio management viewpoint, we further recycled out of a couple of lower productivity centers and into some high productivity properties. With the disposition of the assets that we sold in 2014, we then turned around, and during the course of the year, increased our ownership at Fashion Outlets of Chicago to 100% and also to 100% in 5 malls in the Ontario transaction.
Another key investment that we made during the year, obviously, was The Gallery in Philadelphia, and we're very bullish about that.
As I look forward to 2015 and beyond, the company is extremely well poised, as a result of our portfolio management that we have done over the previous 3 or 4 years, we have -- our balance sheet is well positioned to finance all of our activities here going forward. The leasing outlook is terrific. As I look at upcoming development activities that we have and new ones that we've announced, we announced a couple of months ago our joint venture to build a 500,000 square-foot outlet center at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Demand for that center from a retailer's viewpoint has been very significant. We're very bullish on that.
At Green Acres, we moved that project up to our active development pipeline. That is really the expansion of our retail campus. We're adding 335,000 square feet of restaurants, pads, as well as operators such asked DICK'S, HomeGoods, Ashley Furniture and others. We're very optimistic about the impact that, that's going to have to the retail campus. This is a center that you may remember that when we bought it a couple of years ago, it's doing $500 a square foot. Today, it's doing over $575 a square foot. Leasing activity of the mall has been very dramatic. This expansion of the retail campus, we think, is going to even further enhance the retail destination. We think that it will actually cause the campus to exceed $1 billion in sales over the years to come.
And we anticipate the announcement of a new anchor that will be attached to our -- and part of the enclosed mall itself in the very near term.
A new project that's in our -- that we've talked about that is now in our shadow pipeline is the further densification of Scottsdale Fashion Square. You should think of Scottsdale somewhat in the same context that you think about Tysons Corner. It's a huge retail project, and we're blessed at Scottsdale to have excess land that is going to enable us to further densify that property. Again, we talked about the expansion of the property that's currently underway, and this densification, we think, will just further enhance the retail destination.
Speaking of the destination, at the Super Bowl this last week, the NFL had their fan fest, had an activity at Scottsdale Fashion Square on the 7 acres of vacant land that we have outlined as densification opportunities, and we generated over 0.5 million visitors to that project during the course of the 4, 5 days leading up and into the Super Bowl, and it was very dramatic in terms of the traffic increases and the sales increases that we enjoyed.
At Tysons Corner, we are underway with perfecting the next phase of entitlements, and that's really spun by the confidence that we have in the leasing activities that we have, particularly in the residential side.
We anticipate that at The Gallery in Philadelphia that we will be in a position to announce jointly with our partner Penn REIT the scope of the project, the size of the dollars as well as the incremental returns over the next quarter or so.
At Chicago, in North Bridge, it was announced during the quarter that we acquired a square block contiguous to across the street from Nordstrom, which is either the #1 or #2 Nordstrom store in the United States in terms of sales volume.
And that square block was acquired. It's about 65,000 square feet of building area. We see that we will have opportunities to integrate that into upper Michigan Avenue with the opportunity to have FAR on that site of about 780,000 square feet. We're in early planning phases on that project. Likely outcome will be that we would do the retail, and anything that go vertical above that would most likely be an air rights deal with other folks doing that development.
Another significant activity that happened somewhat in the development arena that will affect us in this year and next year is that Sears announced that they, along with Macerich, through our cooperation, Sears announced that they are going to bifurcate their stores at Freehold and Danbury, 2 of our great centers where Sears will occupy 1 level of their two-level store, consolidate and rationalize into that, and they have sub-let the other level of their anchors store to Primark. We think it's a great addition to each of those centers, high traffic generator, and we are happy to cooperate with Sears as they made their deal with Primark, and they will be responsible for all capital reconnection with that addition.
As I think about 2015 and beyond from an operating viewpoint, I take great confidence in the same-center results that we've had in the previous year. The outlook that we have for this year and beyond, you may remember at our Investor Day that the Tom outlined a footprint for you as to how he felt and we feel that we'll able to achieve over the next 5 years a range of same-center NOI that would generally land at the midpoint of around 4.5%. We're very confident, given our outlook for the future, as well as financial modeling, as well as just the retail environment that, that type of same-center NOI growth is available to us.
With that, I would like to open it up for Q&A, operator."

The rail station has 2 stops near major retail centers, 1 across the street from Bloomingdale's at Santa Monica, another one, 1 block away from Westside Pavilion. But it's a center that really still needs to be reimagined. We think there are densification opportunities there. We've had a significant number of developers and users in the area come and talk to us about that opportunity, particularly as it relates to office and residential. We're going to be debating that and thinking that through. But to pave the way for the future there, we are already beginning to de-lease some short-term lease the retailers that we have there. The center, at last report, was doing around $350 a square foot, which is not at all in keeping with its potential. So we were in early stages of reimagining the center, and we anticipate that over the next year or so, we'll be getting some entitlements to make that possible. But this is a situation where we will have some significant positioning of the center for the ultimate repositioning of it. We don't have anything clear cut to outline today other than it's not what it should be. It's a great location, and we're convinced that 5 years from now, it will be significantly better and more profitable and productive than what it is today."

And just to start with last year, probably the 3 most significant store closures or bankruptcies were Love Culture, Coldwater and Juicy, and that represented about 27 stores on our portfolio. Generally, the stores were located in some of our better centers so the real estate was strong. We have -- as we sit today, about 62% of that has been released in terms of signed leases or deals that have been approved by both the tenant and the landlord and are in documentation. So we picked up about 2/3 of it. In terms of economics, we're looking at about a high mid-single digit increase in total occupancy cost, so there is a reasonably good pickup. But one of the key elements for us is an improvement in quality in terms of bringing in more productive retailers. So to give you a sense, some of the new tenants we brought into those spaces include Soft Surrounding, ANTHROPOLOGIE, H&M, Boston Proper, Soma, Aviva, Hanna Andersson, St. John's, Vera Bradley, Karen Millen, Kiehl's, Godiva, Pandora and UNIQLO. So we've really been able to upgrade the merchandise mix significantly because of the ability to reclaim the real estate and combine that with some uptick in rentals. In terms of the 2015 bankruptcies, a couple of comments. The 5 retailers that have been the most significant include Wet Seal, Body Central, Deb Shops, Delia's and Cache. The comment that I would make is none of these bankruptcies come as a surprise. These are all retailers who have been struggling for many years. Their sales within our portfolio averaged $212 a foot, our centers are just under $600 a foot. So we planned, in terms of our budgets and our 2015 forecast, these store closures. And again, we believe it will present an opportunity to bring in more productive retailers, who ultimately will pay more rent."

The overall number, we're occupancy-neutral, but we are expecting to continue to reduce the amount of temporary occupancy we have. As I said, it was 5.1% at year-end and our goal is to take that down between 50 and 100 basis points. We typically double the rent we achieve when we can convert the space from temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. I think your other question had to do with lease termination payments in the fourth quarter. We had an active fourth quarter leasing front, was also fairly active in terms of generating termination payments. That wasn't from any one tenant. We did get a decent size termination payment from Juicy. But then there were quite a few others. And again, as I mentioned, that's a fairly normal number for us. The year came in at $11.8 million, we averaged $9.6 million over the course -- annually, over the course of the last 5 years. Our guidance in 2015 is again includes $10 million is our assumption for that. The piece that hit in the fourth quarter that related to the same center pool, which I think was another part of your question, was $5 million. That compared to about $600,000 last year. But again, that's one reason we look at that statistics on an annual basis rather than quarter is the lease termination revenue, and there's a cost for that because you give up occupancy. So it hurts your NOI in another way, although it benefits you in terms of getting that cash compensation upfront. We really think that's a statistic we have to take a trailing 12-month number, a full year number, to really have a meaningful look at what's going on there in terms of same-center growth."

But conversely, as I think about our more international tourist centers, centers such as Santa Monica Place, centers such as Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner and Fashion Outlets of Chicago. Fashion Outlets of Chicago sales are on fire. Traffic is up 30-some percent a week, this week versus last year for the last 3 or 4 months. Santa Monica Place, traffic and sales are very, very robust. Same is true at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner. So I mean those are the centers that I think of that benefit from international tourism. And those shoppers are generally well heeled. They plan their trip well in advance, and when they're here, it's for usually extended stays and one of their favorite pastimes is spending money. The numbers speak for themselves.

I think many of these tenants are struggling for different reasons, whether they're in certain respects obsolete like a RadioShack or if they're more of a vintage apparel store that's not distinguishable from their competition. So everyone is a little bit different. But I think our list has been pretty consistent over the last 24 months, and I think each tenant is there for a different reason. But at the end of the day, the disposition process and the improvement of the portfolio, we think, mitigates our exposure to whatever degree of weakness the tenants have."

So let's first of all keep in mind that there are 4 or 5 or 6 major retail centers in Southern California that are under a significant either redevelopment or about to be redeveloped. They're generally all in extremely good locations. They're in unbelievably high barrier to entry locations. They're generally all in the middle of wonderful demographic. But of all of the names that you just mentioned, I do think that The Grove, Beverly Center, Century City, Santa Monica Place and maybe even Del Amo, they're all kind chasing the same customer. And I think that therein lies the opportunity for Westside Pavilion, is to distinguish itself from that and not to chase that same customer. We have a wonderful demographic in a very, very -- it's a really high dense well affluent and educated population in the immediate area of Westside. And then you have the impact of the rail, which is going to give access to Westside from -- all the way from Santa Monica to downtown L.A. And we see people using the rail. They can go to Westside from both directions. Landmark is one of the -- Theaters is one of the top 2 independent film theater venues in the United States. So we see there's a great opportunity. And as you think about the 4 or 5 developments, really, and remember they're all redevelopments, not new supply, it's really generally recycling supply. Remember, it's in the middle of a market that is the ninth largest economy in the world. So it's money that's getting put into a pretty vibrant economy."

The floating rate debt is temporarily high because we paid off Vintage Faire and Fresno right before year-end and we used our line. So when we financed Vintage Faire on March 1, that's going to go straight to reduce floating rate debt, so that will flip right there. So you've seen us being extremely active in the financing market. If you look at our maturity schedule, it's very attractive in terms of how it's evenly layered out as you get past, you look at 2019, that's the highest level with about $700 million in maturities, and everything else is under that, going all the way out to 2025. That's why we picked 11 years for Vintage Faire. That wraps it into 2026. And then the 2016 bucket, which looks somewhat higher right now is going to be reduced when we refinance Washington Square. We'll probably go out 10 or 11 years on that. And then our line of credit in 2018 causes that year to be a little bit lumpy, but we're going to continue to go along when it's available, and I think you're going to see the floating rate debt come down fairly significantly just as a matter of refinancing some of these assets we've been talking about."

And we're constantly thinking about development opportunities and redevelopment opportunities. So the whole purpose of that -- one of the major purposes of the portfolio management on selling assets was to enable us to have the capital to profitably move from slower-growing less productive assets and to plow it into proven winners, but also to have the management to focus in time, to think about fewer opportunities but bigger opportunities and really to focus on great redevelopment. And we're constantly on the lookout for those. There will be -- there's one that -- there's an addition of a new specialty anchor that will be coming at Corte Madera in the next month or 2 that we'll be talking about. Not a huge capital spend, but it is a redevelopment of sorts, an expansion of sorts. And it's just in our DNA.

But it's not everyday that a competitor takes a 4% stake in another company and says they may ask for a waiver to go to 15%. So I guess, just from your perspective, how should we take it that you don't want to comment on it or take any questions on it? I think the market clearly has a pretty good understanding of the company -- of your company, given the Investor Day in November, the conference call today.

It was another very strong quarter for us, across the board. We continued to see strong operating results. Leasing spreads were good, and leasing volumes were very significant. We signed leases on 516,000 square feet of space. That compared to 330,000 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2013. The re-leasing spreads were positive 22%.
Mall occupancy was at 95.8%. That's up 125 basis points from a year ago. Looking at that stat on a same-center basis, we were up 70 basis points from 95.1% at 12/31/13.
Temporary occupancy was 5.1% of that occupancy compared to 5.8% at December 31 of last year, so down about 70 basis points from a year ago, but we still have a lot of progress to make on that front, and that will continue to be a focus for us. Average mall store base rents are now over $50 a foot. They increased to $51.15, up 6% from $48.16 a year ago.
Looking at FFO for the quarter. Reported FFO was $0.99 compared to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of last year. Reflected in FFO was a $9.1 million early extinguishment of debt penalty, $0.06 a share. That was on the early payoff of Vintage Faire and Fresno Fashion Fair loans, which were a combined $250 million and had an average interest rate of 6.2%. We arranged a new $280 million, 3.49%, 11-year fixed-rate loan to be placed on Vintage Faire, essentially replacing that debt that we paid off. And Fresno will remain unencumbered for now.
Excluding the prepayment penalty, we came in at $1.05 for the quarter, right in the middle of our guidance range.
Impacting net income for the quarter but not FFO was a $1.5 billion remeasurement gain that is recorded for accounting purposes as a result of converting our ownership of Queens, Lakewood, Los Cerritos, Stonewood and Washington Square from an unconsolidated 51% to a consolidated 100%. The gain is essentially the value of our 51% interest at the date of the transaction less our book basis.
Same-center NOI for the quarter increased by 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive re-leasing spreads, annual CPI increases on leases. We think, however, it's more meaningful to look at a full year same-center NOI. For the year ended December 31, 2014, same-center NOI growth was 4.24%.
During the fourth quarter, we had stronger occupancy lease term revenue and percentage rents than we had forecast.
Term fees are included in same-center NOI as they are a recurring part of our business, and unlike straight-line rents, it is a cash revenue. It can cause some quarterly fluctuation as it relates to same-center NOI growth, and that's why we feel it's more meaningful to look at a 12-month calculation for that metric or at least a year-to-date calculation.
For leased terminations for the year. Came in at $11.8 million. That was only slightly higher than our guidance level of $10 million, and, in fact, our average annual lease termination revenues over the past 5 years has averaged $9.6 million.
We had a $2.6 million gain on land sale during the quarter, and offsetting that gain and included in REIT G&A costs were $3 million worth of transaction costs related to the acquisition activity in the fourth quarter. And that is included in REIT G&A and caused the increase to $12.1 million in total.
Bad debt expense for the quarter was $700,000. That compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. And as a result of refinancing activity and the interest rate environment we've been in, our average interest rate is down to 3.5% compared to 4.2% in the fourth quarter of last year.
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. We have the strongest balance sheet in the history of our company. At quarter end, some of the balance sheet metrics [ph] included debt-to-market cap at 33%; interest coverage ratio of 3.8x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.2 years; and floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt is 17%.
We continue to see a great financing environment given our ability to borrow at such attractive rates. As I mentioned, we paid off Fresno Fashion Fair, Vintage Faire early and secured a very attractive 3.49% financing on Vintage Faire. That's an 11-year fixed-rate term.
We also had some other attractive financing opportunities ahead of us this year, including Lakewood Mall, which is very underleveraged and currently carries a 5.43% interest rate, and Washington Square, which has a 6.02% coupon.
Those will be financed later this year, no doubt at substantial savings.
In this morning's press release, we also gave FFO guidance. The range is $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This assumes no asset sales in 2015. It does include dilution of about $0.10 a share from the assets we sold in 2014. It reflects a same-center NOI growth rate of 4.25% to 4.75%. We are seeing the benefit of the pruning that we did to our portfolio in 2013 and '14, and that's reflected in this assumption and our expectation of seeing accelerating same-center NOI growth.
The guidance assumes $10 million of lease termination revenue, just slightly less than actual of $11.8 million this year. There's been no acquisitions factored into that guidance, and there's been no gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt factored into the guidance. And you can see that guidance -- those guidance assumptions detailed in our supplement.
Again, looking at the quarterly split on the FFO guidance: the first quarter is expected to be 21%; second quarter, 24%; third quarter, 25%; and the fourth quarter, 30%.
Looking at tenant sales for a moment. Total portfolio sales per foot for the year were $587.  That compared to $562 last year.
If you look at that calculation on a same-center basis, it was $587 compared to $574. The top regions for us were Arizona and Southern California, and if we take a look at total sales for the period, the quarter ended December 31, 2014, total sales were up 2.2%.
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

First of all, I would like to briefly address the speculation in the market regarding Simon Property Group's investment in Macerich. As you likely know, in November 2014, Simon announced that it had acquired a stake in our company. At this point, there is really nothing more that we can share with you. It's our policy not to comment on market rumors or speculation, and we do not intend to make any further comments or statements during this call regarding Simon.
With that, I want to remind you all that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our fourth quarter and full year's earnings results as well as our outlook for 2015. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on these topics.
Turning now to the results for 2014. As Tom has outlined for you, it was a terrific year for our company. It wasn't transformational, but it was certainly an evolutionary year, where many important benchmarks were reached.
From an operating viewpoint, we put up some very good numbers, with occupancy levels increasing.  Leasing was extremely strong. The environment is extremely good. Our spreads remained very, very good during the year, up 22% for the trailing 12 months.
As Tom outlined for you, our balance sheet is in terrific shape, and we see the opportunity in the next 18 months to even further enhance it with some very opportunistic refinancing opportunities coming up available to us.
Development. We had some significant milestones during the year, some great accomplishments on portfolio management.
As we look at the development activities during the course of 2014 and our outlook for 2015, again, we had some very good milestones. The Tysons, our office tower, is now over 80% leased. The residential tower's leasing up extremely well, and the hotel is poised to open here later on the end of this quarter, the beginning of next.
At Scottsdale Fashion Square, as well as Cerritos, we're well underway on construction to add 2 new junior anchors at each of them, a sporting goods operator, DICK'S, at each of them and a major theater complex, Harkins, at each of them.
Speaking of theaters, the theater at Santa Monica Place, construction there is going along well, with an opening there anticipated here in the -- later on in the third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year. Coupled with the second generation re-leasing of the center, that theater is already spawning significant renewed interest into the center, particularly into the third level.
Looking to the third level of the property, for example, we recently signed and are actually under construction on the recycling of some existing restaurant space into a new Cheesecake Factory, which we think will do terrific here in this market.
We also have new major tenants such as UNIQLO that has replaced Love Culture, and I'm sure there may be other retailers at Santa Monica Place that Bob may point out to you that we have either recycled or are recycling, all with a view towards really taking this center up to a very significant level of improvement in the productivity.
At Broadway Plaza, we had a terrific first part of our expansion there with the demolition and complete reconstruction of a parking deck that was contiguous to Nordstrom. This was necessary to create the footprint for the expansion of Broadway Plaza. That was done and completed all within 6 or 7 months, which is really terrific.
At Fashion Outlets at Niagara, our expansion opened up on schedule, on budget, well leased, well over 85% leased.
At Kings Plaza, our remodel and remerchandising is going tremendously well, and we're moving along very well on our entitlements at The Gallery.
From a portfolio management viewpoint, we further recycled out of a couple of lower-productivity centers and into some high-productivity properties. With the disposition of the assets that we sold in 2014, we then turned around, and during the course of the year, increased our ownership at Fashion Outlets of Chicago to 100% and also to 100% in 5 malls in the Ontario transaction.
Another key investment that we made during the year, obviously, was The Gallery in Philadelphia, and we're very bullish about that.
As I look forward to 2015 and beyond, the company is extremely well poised, as a result of our portfolio management that we have done over the previous 3 or 4 years, we have -- our balance sheet is well positioned to finance all of our activities here going forward. The leasing outlook is terrific. As I look at upcoming development activities that we have and new ones that we've announced, we announced a couple of months ago our joint venture to build a 500,000-square-foot outlet center at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Demand for that center from a retailer's viewpoint has been very significant. We're very bullish on that.
At Green Acres, we moved that project up to our active development pipeline. That is really the expansion of our retail campus. We're adding 335,000 square feet of restaurants, pads, as well as operators such as DICK'S, HomeGoods, Ashley Furniture and others. We're very optimistic about the impact that, that's going to have to the retail campus. This is a center that you may remember that when we bought it a couple of years ago, it was doing $500 a square foot. Today, it's doing over $575 a square foot. Leasing activity in the mall has been very dramatic. This expansion of the retail campus, we think, is going to even further enhance the retail destination. We think that it will actually cause the campus to exceed $1 billion in sales over the years to come.  And we anticipate the announcement of a new anchor that will be attached and part of the enclosed mall itself in the very near term.
A new project that's in our -- that we've talked about that is now in our shadow pipeline is the further densification of Scottsdale Fashion Square. You should think of Scottsdale somewhat in the same context that you think about Tysons Corner. It's a huge retail project, and we're blessed at Scottsdale to have excess land that is going to enable us to further densify that property. Again, we talked about the expansion of the property that's currently underway, and this densification, we think, will just further enhance the retail destination.
Speaking of the destination, at the Super Bowl this last week, the NFL had their Fan Fest tent and activities at Scottsdale Fashion Square on the 7 acres of vacant land that we have outlined as densification opportunities. And we generated over 0.5 million visitors to that project during the course of the 4 or 5 days leading up and into the Super Bowl, and it was very dramatic in terms of the traffic increases and the sales increases that we enjoyed.
At Tysons Corner, we are underway with perfecting the next phase of entitlements, and that's really spawned by the confidence that we have in the leasing activities that we have, particularly in the residential side.
We anticipate that at The Gallery in Philadelphia that we will be in a position to announce jointly with our partner Penn REIT the scope of the project, the size of the dollars as well as the incremental returns over the next quarter or so.
At Chicago, in North Bridge, it was announced during the quarter that we acquired a square block contiguous to, across the street from Nordstrom, which is either the #1 or #2 Nordstrom store in the United States in terms of sales volume. And that square block was acquired. It's about 65,000 square feet of building area. We see that we will have opportunities to integrate that into upper Michigan Avenue with the opportunity to have FAR on that site of about 780,000 square feet. We're in early planning phases on that project. Likely outcome will be that we would do the retail, and anything that'd go vertical above that would most likely be an air rights deal with other folks doing that development.
Another significant activity that happened somewhat in the development arena that will affect us in this year and next year is that Sears announced that they, along with Macerich, through our cooperation, Sears announced that they are going to bifurcate their stores at Freehold and Danbury, 2 of our great centers, where Sears will occupy 1 level of their two-level store, consolidate and rationalize into that, and they have sub-let the other level of their anchor store to Primark. We think it's a great addition to each of those centers, high-traffic generator, and we are happy to cooperate with Sears as they made their deal with Primark, and they will be responsible for all capital in connection with that addition.
As I think about 2015 and beyond from an operating viewpoint, I take great confidence in the same-center results that we've had in the previous year. The outlook that we have for this year and beyond, you may remember at our Investor Day that Tom outlined a footprint for you as to how he felt and we feel that we'll able to achieve over the next 5 years a range of same-center NOI that would generally land in the midpoint of around 4.5%. We're very confident, given our outlook for the future, as well as financial modeling, as well as just the retail environment that, that type of same-center NOI growth is available to us.
With that, I would like to open it up for Q&A, operator."

The rail station has 2 stops near major retail centers, 1 across the street from Bloomingdale's at Santa Monica, another one 1 block away from Westside Pavilion. But it's a center that really still needs to be reimagined. We think there are densification opportunities there. We've had a significant number of developers and users in the area come and talk to us about that opportunity, particularly as it relates to office and residential. We're going to be debating that and thinking that through. But to pave the way for the future there, we are already beginning to de-lease and short-term lease the retailers that we have there. The center, at last report, was doing around $350 a square foot, which is not at all in keeping with its potential. So we're in early stages of reimagining the center, and we anticipate that over the next year or so, we'll be getting some entitlements to make that possible. But this is a situation where we will have some significant positioning of the center for the ultimate repositioning of it.

And just to start with last year, probably the 3 most significant store closures or bankruptcies were Love Culture, Coldwater and Juicy, and that represented about 27 stores throughout our portfolio. Generally, the stores were located in some of our better centers, so the real estate was strong. We have -- as we sit today, about 62% of that has been re-leased in terms of signed leases or deals that have been approved by both the tenant and the landlord and are in documentation. So we've picked up about 2/3 of it. In terms of economics, we're looking at about a high mid-single digit increase in total occupancy cost, so there is a reasonably good pickup. But one of the key elements for us is an improvement in quality in terms of bringing in more productive retailers. So to give you a sense, some of the new tenants we've brought into those spaces include Soft Surroundings, ANTHROPOLOGIE, H&M, Boston Proper, Soma, Aviva, Hanna Andersson, St. John's, Vera Bradley, Karen Millen, Kiehl's, Godiva, Pandora and UNIQLO. So we've really been able to upgrade the merchandise mix significantly because of the ability to reclaim the real estate and combine that with some uptick in rentals. In terms of the 2015 bankruptcies, a couple of comments. The 5 retailers that have been the most significant include Wet Seal, Body Central, Deb Shop, Delia's and Cache. The comment that I would make is none of these bankruptcies come as a surprise. These are all retailers who have been struggling for many years. Their sales within our portfolio averaged $212 a foot. Our centers are just under $600 a foot. So we've planned, in terms of our budgets and our 2015 forecast, these store closures. And again, we believe it'll present an opportunity to bring in more productive retailers who ultimately will pay more rent."

The overall number, we're occupancy-neutral, but we are expecting to continue to reduce the amount of temporary occupancy we have. As I said, it was 5.1% at year end, and our goal is to take that down between 50 and 100 basis points. We typically double the rent we achieve when we convert the space from temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. I think your other question had to do with lease termination payments in the fourth quarter. We had an active fourth quarter on the leasing front. It was also fairly active in terms of generating termination payments. That wasn't from any one tenant. We did get a decent-size termination payment from Juicy. But then there were quite a few others. And again, as I mentioned, that's a fairly normal number for us. The year came in at $11.8 million, we've averaged $9.6 million over the course -- annually, over the course of the last 5 years. Our guidance in 2015 is -- again, includes $10 million, is our assumption for that. The piece that hit in the fourth quarter that related to the same-center pool, which I think was another part of your question, was $5 million. That compared to about $600,000 last year. But again, that's one reason we look at that statistic on an annual basis rather than a quarter, is the lease termination revenue. And there's a cost for that because you give up occupancy. So it hurts your NOI in another way, although it benefits you in terms of getting that cash compensation up front. We really think that's a statistic we have to take in a trailing 12-month number, a full year number, to really have a meaningful look at what's going on there in terms of same-center growth."

But conversely, as I think about our more international tourist centers, centers such as Santa Monica Place, centers such as Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner and Fashion Outlets of Chicago. Fashion Outlets of Chicago sales are on fire. Traffic is up 30-some percent a week, this week versus last year for the last 3 or 4 months. Santa Monica Place, traffic and sales are very, very robust. Same is true at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner. So, I mean, those are the centers that I think of that benefit from international tourism. And those shoppers are generally well heeled.

At this point, it's not in our guidance this year in terms of any planned dispositions, but we have said that, look, we see this as a reservoir of capital that we do intend over the next 5 years to recycle out of those assets and into either new opportunities or more productive assets. So it's just a question of timing, Steve. And at this point in time, the market is getting increasingly comfortable with buying these types of assets, so we don't feel compelled to rush into further dispositions here. It's not in our guidance, but it's clearly in our long-term plan. And I would define our long-term plan to be the next 3 to 5 years."

They're generally all in extremely good locations. They're in unbelievably high barrier-to-entry locations. They're generally all in the middle of wonderful demographic. But of all of the names that you just mentioned, I do think that The Grove, Beverly Center, Century City, Santa Monica Place and maybe even Del Amo, they're all kind chasing the same customer. And I think that therein lies the opportunity for Westside Pavilion, is to distinguish itself from that and not to chase that same customer, to -- we have a wonderful demographic in the very, very -- it's a really high-dense, well-affluent and educated population in the immediate area of Westside. And then you have the impact of the rail, which is going to give access to Westside from -- all the way from Santa Monica to downtown L.A. And we see people using the rail. They can go to Westside from both directions. Landmark is one of the -- Theaters is one of the top 2 independent film theater venues in the United States. So we see it as a great opportunity. And as you think about the 4 or 5 developments, really, and remember they're all redevelopments, not new supply, it's really generally recycling supply. Remember, it's in the middle of a market that is the ninth-largest economy in the world. So it's money that's getting put into a pretty vibrant economy."

The floating rate debt is temporarily high because we paid off Vintage Faire and Fresno right before year end, and we used our line. So when we finance Vintage Faire on March 1, that's going to go straight to reduce floating rate debt, so that'll flip right there. So you've seen us be extremely active in the financing market. If you look at our maturity schedule, it's very attractive in terms of how it's evenly layered out as you get past -- you look at 2019, that's the highest level at about $700 million in maturities, and everything else is under that, going all the way out to 2025. That's why we picked 11 years for Vintage Faire. That drops it into 2026. And then the 2016 bucket, which looks somewhat high right now, is going to be reduced when we refinance Washington Square. We'll probably go out 10 or 11 years on that. And then our line of credit in 2018 causes that year to be a little bit lumpy, but we're going to continue to go long when it's available, and I think you're going to see the floating rate debt come down fairly significantly just as a matter of refinancing some of these assets we've been talking about."

I will tell you that as it relates to that, to operating margins, that's not a number that most people focus on in running regional shopping centers historically. It's certainly a very topical number these days for a lot of sell-side analysts. But if you force me to focus on that metrics, I would tell you that there's definitely 300, 400 basis points of improvement available there. As I think about the development pipeline, I would point out that some of the new shadow projects are still a couple of years down the road from being put into place. And we're constantly thinking about development opportunities and redevelopment opportunities. The whole purpose of that -- one of the major purposes of the portfolio management on selling assets was to enable us to have the capital to profitably move from slower-growing, less-productive assets and to plow it into proven winners, but also to have the management to focus in time to think about fewer opportunities but bigger opportunities and really to focus on great redevelopment. And we're constantly on the lookout for those. There will be -- there's one that -- there's an addition of a new specialty anchor that will be coming at Corte Madera in the next month or 2 that we'll be talking about. Not a huge capital spend, but is a redevelopment of sorts, an expansion of sorts. And it's just in our DNA. We are -- our history is taking great properties, great real estate, and then bringing them up to their full potential. So we're constantly on the lookout for that. Does that answer your question?"

If we run out of time, and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Kerry or Bob Perlmutter. It was another very strong quarter. We are in a really started to see the benefit in our operating results of all the major portfolio transformation that we've been through the past 2 years, including the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that competent into more productive, faster-growing assets. Leasing spreads were good again this quarter. We signed 321,000 square feet of leases positive releasing spread of 21% over the trailing 12 months. While occupancy at a high level at 95.4%, which was up 30 basis points compared to March 31 of last year. In looking at a temporary occupancy, we continue to reduce that. That was 5.2%, that compared to 5.5% at March 31 of last year. We'll continue to focus on that area. We continue to see the potential to grow at the lines result of converting the temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. 
Average mall base rents increase of to 54 19, that was up 10% from a year ago. FFO for the quarter was at $0.79 compared to $0.81 for the prior year. Reflected in there was $2.2 million of gain on early extinction of debt on Lakewood. Going the other direction was $13.6 million of expenses related to an unsolicited takeover attempt. Excluding the gain on extinguishment as well as the expenses, FFO came in at $0.86 a share for the quarter ahead of both our guidance and the consensus estimates. Impact in the quarter was same-center NOI growth and the sector leading 5% compared to last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy positive releasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
The gross margin improved to 66.6%, that was up from 64.9% a year ago. Again, also driven by occupancy gains and strong leasing environment, including the second half of last year, rent bumps as well as expense reductions in the first quarter this year. 
Bad debt expense was up slightly to $1.6 million compared to $800,000 last year in the first quarter. Much of that was driven by RadioShack and Wet Seal. The average interest rate continues to go down. It was 3.5% at quarter end compared to 4.1% at March 31, 2014. The balance sheet is in great shape. We had the strongest balance sheet that we've had in the story of our company. At quarter end, the various balance sheet metrics were debt-to-market cap, 33%; interest coverage ratio, 3.5x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.4 years; floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt was 19%. That is somewhat artificially high was we paid off Lakewood during the quarter, and we'll be refinancing that with a permanent loan. We have agreed to a $410 million loan, 11 years, 3.43% fixed-rate and that's going to be funded this quarter and the proceeds will be used to pay down the line of credit. In addition, we're in the market to put a long-term fixed-rate loan on the unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. Those process will be in the neighborhood of $320 million to $340 million and those proceeds will also be used primarily to pay down our line of credit.
In the press release this morning, based on the strong first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year, we bumped our FFO guidance range up to $3.83 to $3.93. Also embedded in that increase was an increase in our assumption of same-center NOI growth, which we bumped 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5% on average for the year. We had good tenant sales growth during the quarter. The average portfolio sales per foot for the trailing 12 months was $607, that compared to $525 a year ago. If you look at it on a same-center basis, excluding dispositions that happened over the course of the last 12 months, the same-center sales were $604 and that compared to $579 on a same-center basis, for an increase of 4.3%. Strongest regions for us were again California and Arizona, which were both up strong. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment."

The first quarter leasing activity was solid, generating above-average leasing spreads on the velocity. We continue to see retailers invest our capital into the following venues: A, mall locations, outlet centers, flagship locations and omni-channel rate of initiatives. The quality of them Macerich portfolio is consistent with the retailer objectives, which is demonstrated in the above average operating metrics. Areas of strength within the portfolio included: One, large format retailers and anchor retailers. During Q1, over 400,000 square feet of new leases were executed retailers over 10,000 square feet. Some of the notable deals completed during the first quarter included Century 21 at Green Acres mall; and Restoration Hardware Gallery, who will construct a 50,000 square-foot building at the Village at Corte Madera, which is the company's hometown. Secondly, we are seeing the expansion of core brands from retailers with larger for fleets. Throughout the portfolio, retailers such rental for flower, exciting, Kay Jewelers and support our as expanding their square footages and developing new formats. But in our portfolio, these quartets represented significant amount of the square footage and the strength of their business benefits our centers. Thirdly, there is continued growth from a foreign-based retailers. Demand for space within the center is high as the U.S. markets are viewed favorably with good growth prospects in the coming years. Most of the attention falls on the fast fashion retailers, which include H&M, Zara and UNIQLO. Within our portfolio, we've been active with all 3 , including 2 new deals signed during Q1 with Zara at Broadway Plaza and The Oaks. While much of the attention is why the focused on these 3 players. We also see this activity confirmed this week risk, including ID you may now disconnect opals, garage, camper, dilemma, Nespresso, giggle, Gerry Weber, Joe Malone, Michael Hill and importantly, mark. Next while more limited in their store openings, we see demand from emerging specialty blends on either a stand-alone basis or within the umbrella of larger retail companies. Examples of larger retail companies developing new brands, which generate store expansions include: Little lemon, development with the the; Gap's expansion of Al Qaeda; and Taylor's of blue and gray; H&M's development of an other story; and Macy's purchase of Blue Mercury. Newer new were stand-alone concepts that we've completed deals with include: Kidneys, we'll cycle for the Broadway Plaza expansion; Soft Surroundings, who signed 3 leases during the quarter; Yellow Box, who recently opened a in Commons; Jonathan Adler, who recently opened at Santa Monica Pipe; and Ken , was coming to allow to katana. Find adjudicative experienced growth in the fast casual and full-service restaurant categories. During the first quarter, we signed leases with Shake Shack and Scottsdale Fashion Square in Queens Center, bringing our portfolio total to 4 units. We also signed deals with Cheesecake Factory at Santa Monica, both properties are adding state-of-the-art we also continued to expand our presence with more traditional players like Schiphol, Starbucks and divide up. Regarding 2014 bankruptcies, we've made great progress with the release of Coldwater Creek, Juicy and Love Culture. Within our portfolio, there were a combined 27 locations containing approximately 170,000 square feet. Today,, the also be completed on approximately 80% of the spaces. While impacting our occupancy in the short-term, we have significantly improved the quality of the tendency and a productivity from the spaces. New tenants sign for these locations are illustrative of who is active in the marketplace. Deals completed include: Anthropology, Hanna Andersson, Bradley, Pandora, Michael Kors, Soft Surroundings, Aviva, St. John's, UNIQLO, feels and H&M. Bankruptcies during the first quarter included: Wet Seal, Radio Shack, cash, Deb Shops and body shop. In total, the store closures included 52 locations with approximately 113,000 square feet. This impacted the portfolio occupancy by about 50 basis points in Q1. Looking forward, we believe there are opportunities to increase revenues by: One, increase our total occupancy while continuing to reduce temporary tenant occupancy levels; two, significantly increasing the revenue generation of presentation quality within the common areas; and three, maximizing our leasing spreads based on the continued improvement of the portfolio of quality. In summary, we believe our portfolio is well positioned in the current retail environment with many must-have locations for retailers in both traditional mall and outlet center format."

As you could tell, we have great -- we have a terrific quarter, and our outlook for the future in the balance of this year on the operating front is extremely strong. While the focus today on our call is on the business and operating and financial results, I would like to make a few brief comments with respect to recent developments. We would then like to keep the remainder of the call focused on our strong earnings performance and guidance. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on our results and outlook. First, I want to highlight that we always seek to maintain open communication with our shareholders, and we value their viewpoints. Over the past 2 months, together with our Lead Director, Fred Opel, we have spent a significant amount of time speaking with and listening to the majority of our top 30 shareholders. One of the consistent comments from these meetings is that our shareholders want us to remain focused on the business to ensure that we continue driving outsized returns. This is our top priority, and I can tell you that our entire organization is engaged and energized with a singular focus on performance and shareholder returns. You'll see that as Tom and I continue to share with you the results during the balance of this call and discuss with you a number of our new and recent initiatives. In addition, our shareholders have also expressed their viewpoints on governance, including the difficult decisions that we made in light of that takeover attempt. The board did not take these -- or make these decisions lightly. The board only implemented governance changes because it believed they were essential to protecting shareholder value. We continue to solicit shareholder feedback on this topic and intend to announce several changes in the near future that we believe will further demonstrate the board's ongoing commitment to sound corporate governance. Again, this will be announced in the near future. We're not prepared to get into the details of them today. I also want to briefly address the nominations that we have received and related litigation. As the litigations is pending, we will not be commenting further on it today. In summary, and as noted in our preliminary proxy, we notified the New York Stock Exchange with the record date for the 2015 Annual Meeting would be March 20, 2015. Xanthan Buildings was not a shareholder on March 20. It acquired 1,100 shares after the record date on March 25 and 26 and submitted its nominations on March 31. We advise of them privately because that because there were not a stockholder of record on March 20, that their submission was effective. The rules to nominate candidates are the same for all stockholders, and this matter is now pending before the court. Now I'd like to turn to picking up on the results of our quarter and our prognosis for the balance of the year. As you can see from the numbers that Tom shared with you that you read and the color that Bobby gave you, we had a terrific quarter, and we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth and value creation that Macerich over the balance of this year and into the future. We believe that the company is at an important inflection point with outsized growth coming over the next several years as we reap the benefits of the significant investments we have made in portfolio management and transformation of our portfolio. In particular note, it is nice to see that our average sales per foot today on our entire portfolio is an excess of $600 a square foot. We believe that our focus in the following 5 major initiatives will play an important role in our ability to continue to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders. Five initiatives are to continue to drive same-center NOI growth at above average rates; two, improve our operating margins and have margin expansion; portfolio management is number three; I'm going to be talked about number four, this year's joint venture that was just announced this morning by Sears; and number five, our ongoing developments. In terms of same-center and a wide growth, due to the printing of our portfolio and the reinvestment of that competent into our highly productive core portfolio, we see the opportunity for superior same-center NOI growth, both this year and in the years to come. Our targeted same-center NOI growth is now, for this year, is budgeted and guided to be 4.5% to 5% and represents a significant acceleration for past years. Number two, another major initiative that frankly, is the result of a wake-up call on this topic is operating margin expansion. In addition to the same-center NOI growth that we anticipate, we also see the opportunity in -- to increase our operating margins, both this year and next. We believe that in the very foreseeable future, which I'm looking out over 24 months that we have  the opportunity to increase our operating margins by at least 400 basis points, primarily this will be done to the combination of efficiency projects as well as enhancing the common areas of our malls to improve the customer experience and increase incremental revenues from that area. .
Three, Portfolio management and capital recycling. We are currently taking inbounds and sending out outbounds to examine opportunities to monetize assets within our portfolio, both through joint ventures as well as through dispositions and the redeployed those proceeds into the most profitable vehicle available to us at that point in time. We think that through asset monetization and portfolio management that, that will help many of you to help to get better transparency and improve your view of the NAV of the company, and we believe that it will validate the view of the NAV of the company that management has and that our board concluded. 
Number  four, the Sears joint venture. This was just concluded late last night. In that the transaction, we entered into a transaction very similar to the one that Sears entered into with 2 of our other periods. We are entering into a joint venture for the redevelopment of 9 Sears locations that are presently owned and controlled by Sears. This is a 50-50 joint venture and gives us the right to recapture 50% of that GLA that Sears occupies and then to redeploy that. We are investing $150 million into this joint venture, and anticipate just north of a 6% return on our investment in the beginning year with opportunities to profitably reinvest into this joint venture as we identify recycling and redevelopment opportunities at these 9 locations. I would point out that the 9 locations that we entered into our joint venture with Sears on have average sales per square foot at the mall itself of $680 a square foot. The locations are and Chandler and Phoenix; Dannburry in Connecticut; Deptford, New Jersey; Freehold, New Jersey; Los Cerritos Center out in California; South Plains in Lubbock; Modesto; and Washington Square in the Portland -- greater Portland market. In addition, concurrently, with the transaction, we also entered into an agreement with Sears that gives us the right to recapture the 300,000 square foot store at Kings Plaza we 180 days prior notice. That really will jumpstart the next phase of the Kings Plaza redevelopment. We're just finishing up under the remodeling and remerchandising of the mall, and we're in talks today with the -- for the addition  of 2 to 3 new anchors and/or junior anchors to be redeployed that Sears square footage. We see great opportunities there. 
Moving into the development area. I'm not going to go through each of our development pipeline activities because I want to leave plenty of time for questions. I would just one in particular and that is Tysons Corner. It is now coming to completion in terms of the densification project. Our board had a meeting at Tysons Corner last week, and I would encourage you all to get an opportunity the next time you're in the marketplace to take a look at what we have accomplished there. Our office complexes now over 85% leased. The hotel is open. The residential tower is having tenants begin to move in this weekend. The tower is already 25% pre-leased, which is significantly above what our residential fee developer had projected at rents that are above our pro forma and the top of the market in the marketplace. So in summary, we are extremely bullish on our prospects. We think that we have a very clear plan to continue to deliver shareholder value, and we look forward to discussing that plan and delivering on that plan over the months to come. Again, as a reminder, our call today is to discuss our results for the quarter recently ended. We are happy to address any questions about financial and operating results redevelopment initiatives, pipeline and outlook, but we will not be commenting further on the other matters that I discussed earlier about governance and other -- and litigation. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. And operator, we'd like to now open it up for Q&A."

So again like I mentioned, we had a wake-up call, obviously, in November when this topic was first brought to the conversation in conjunction with the unsolicited takeover attempt. And we did a big soul-searching and said, “are there ways that we can improve our margins?"" We have some systemic issues with some of our margins where we do business in major urban marketplaces where the cross of doing business is extremely high, primarily from real estate taxes and infrastructure costs. And those margins will always be different than a suburban location. But the revenues and the sales make up for it, so the bottom line is the profitability of the mall and the urban malls generate huge NOIs even though the margins on balance may not look as attractive as a suburban mall. But having said that, we did come to the conclusion that we could, in fact, through a combination of initiatives and there are dozens and dozens and dozens of initiatives that add up to getting into the ability to increase our margins by 400 basis points, some of them are cost-saving initiatives, some of them are revenue-generating initiatives in a multitude of different areas. But I think that clearly, there's an opportunity, which we have been working on anyway through the middle of last year and into the end of last year into elevating the common area experience  in our malls, which includes many different initiatives to improve the customer experience. Things like eliminating customer service booths and going to either virtual concierge or roving concierge and then replacing those service booths with revenue-generating retailers and through a combination of really expense reductions and common area revenue enhancements. We clearly see that over the next 24 months, there's about a 400-basis-point operating margin expansion available to us. I would say that about 100 basis points of that is pretty well baked into our guidance for this year, but there's still lots of upside to be derived in that arena."

Actually, we first approached Sears with the idea of doing a joint venture on their real estate as opposed to them trying to monetize it or build up a development department themselves back in a personal meeting I had with Andy Lambert on December 10. I guess you could say opportunity I got a little distracted over the coming months from being able to finish our joint venture, but I guess I can say -- we kind of planted to seed with that in and others helped cultivate the tree and now we are kind of picking the apples of the tree. So we identified the 9 locations that we thought had the most upside in terms of what they could really demonstrate to each other in terms of value, and we agreed on those 9 locations. And then collateral to that conversation, we talked about several lease locations and one in particular that we had an immediate need for and appetite for that they were willing to cooperate with us on was Kings Plaza. So you're right. If you look at the way Green Street has their database, all of the 9 locations that we did joint ventures on were A+ to A- type of malls, but more importantly, since we disclosed sales per foot by property versus others, you can see and know that our 9 locations do $680 a square foot, which if you compare that to the database that Green Street has on the other transactions, is a different significant notch above in quality. So again, I mean, look, we're very happy to this with Sears. We think it's a very positive step in terms of helping them rationalize. And we think there's a lot of upside for the company and it is immediately accretive to this year's earnings."

We see pricing power improving because we're out of a situation of reverse leverage where the tenants know that they have an equal seat at a table with the desire to keep stores open at lesser quality centers. So we feel like we've been able to accomplish a similar percentage increase on a higher rental rate, which is an indication that a strategy of fitting in the portfolio is the right one."

So I that numbers before and I'm not fresh on them today, but if our portfolio is doing $607 a foot, that's probably the result of 1/3 of our tenants doing $300 a foot and 1/3 of them doing $600 a foot and then under 1/3 of them doing $1,000 a foot, I don't know. But a lot of what we do every day is we don't wait for the leases to expire, and we're constantly in the process of trying to recycle unproductive tenants out and bring in tenants that we believe will do better than  the mall average. That's how we get our sales to go up."

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean Wood. 
It was another very strong quarter. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results of all the major portfolio transformation that we've been through the past 2 years, including the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that capital into more productive, faster-growing assets. Leasing spreads were good again this quarter. We signed 321,000 square feet of leases, positive re-leasing spread of 21% over the trailing 12 months. Mall occupancy hit a high level at 95.4%, which was up 30 basis points compared to March 31 of last year. In looking at the temporary occupancy, we continued to reduce that, that was 5.2%. That compared to 5.5% at March 31 of last year. We'll continue to focus on that area. We continue to see the potential to grow NOI as a result of converting that temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. Average mall base rents increased to $54.19, that was up 10% from a year ago. 
FFO for the quarter was at $0.79 compared to $0.81 for the prior year. Reflected in there was $2.2 million of gain on early extinguishment of debt on Lakewood. Going the other direction was $13.6 million of expenses related to an unsolicited takeover attempt. Excluding the gain on extinguishment as well as the expenses, FFO came in at $0.86 a share for the quarter, ahead of both our guidance and the consensus estimates. 
Impacting the quarter was same-center NOI growth at a sector-leading 5% compared to last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
The gross margin improved to 66.6%, that was up from 64.9% a year ago, again also driven by occupancy gain with a strong leasing environment, including the second half of last year rent bumps as well as expense reductions in the first quarter this year. 
Bad debt expense was up slightly to $1.6 million compared to $800,000 last year in the first quarter. Much of that was driven by RadioShack and Wet Seal. 
The average interest rate continued to go down. It was 3.5% at quarter-end compared to 4.1% at March 31, 2014. 
The balance sheet's in great shape. We had the strongest balance sheet that we've had in the history of our company. At quarter-end, the various balance sheet metrics were: debt-to-market cap, 33%; interest coverage ratio, 3.5x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.4 years; floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt was 19%, that is somewhat artificially high as we paid off Lakewood during the quarter and we'll be refinancing that with a permanent loan. We have agreed to a $410 million loan, 11 years, 3.43% fixed rate and that's going to be funded this quarter and the proceeds will be used to pay down the line of credit. In addition, we're in the market to put a long-term fixed-rate loan on the unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. Those proceeds will be in the neighborhood of $320 million to $340 million and those proceeds will also be used primarily to pay down our line of credit.
In the press release this morning, based on a strong first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year, we bumped our FFO guidance range up to $3.83 to $3.93. Also embedded in that increase was an increase in our assumption of same-center NOI growth, which we bumped 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5% on average for the year. 
We had good tenant sales growth during the quarter. The average portfolio sales per foot for the trailing 12 months was $607, that compared to $565 a year ago. If you look at it on a same-center basis, excluding dispositions that happened over the course of the last 12 months, the same-center sales were $604 and that compared to $579 on a same-center basis for an increase of 4.3%. 
Strongest regions for us were again California and Arizona, which were both up strong. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment."

The first quarter leasing activity was solid, generating above-average leasing spreads on good velocity. We continue to see retailers invest our capital into the following venues: A mall locations, outlet centers, flagship locations and omni-channel rate of initiatives. The quality of The Macerich portfolio is consistent with the retailer objectives, which is demonstrated in the above-average operating metrics. 
Areas of strength within the portfolio included: one, large-format retailers and anchor retailers. During Q1, over 400,000 square feet of new leases were executed with retailers over 10,000 square feet. Some of the notable deals completed during the first quarter included Century 21 at Green Acres Mall and Restoration Hardware Gallery who will construct a 50,000-square-foot building at The Village at Corte Madera, which is the company's hometown. 
Secondly, we are seeing the expansion of core brands from retailers with larger store fleets. Throughout the portfolio, retailers such L Brands, Foot Locker, Luxottica, Kay Jewelers and Sephora are expanding their square footages and developing new formats. Within our portfolio, these core tenants represented significant amount of the square footage and the strength of their business benefits our centers. 
Thirdly, there is continued growth from a foreign-based retailers. Demand for space within the center is high as the U.S. markets are viewed favorably with good growth prospects in the coming years. Most of the attention falls on the fast-fashion retailers, which include H&M, Zara and UNIQLO. Within our portfolio, we have been active with all three , including 2 new deals signed during Q1 with Zara at Broadway Plaza and The Oaks. While much of the attention is rightly focused on these 3 players, we also see activity from foreign-based retailers, including adidas, Kooples, Garage, Camper, lululemon, Nespresso, KIKO, Gerry Weber, Jo Malone, Michael Hill, and importantly, Primark. 
Next, while more limited in their store openings, we see demand from emerging specialty brands on either a stand-alone basis or within the umbrella of larger retail companies. Examples of larger retail companies developing new brands, which generate store expansions include: lululemon's development with ivivva, Gap's expansion of Athleta, Ann Taylor's development of Lou & Grey, H&M's development of & Other Stories, and Macy's purchase of Bluemercury. 
Newer stand-alone concepts that we have completed deals with include Kidmates who have signed on to the Broadway Plaza expansion, Soft Surroundings who signed 3 leases during the quarter, Yellow Box who recently opened at Kierland Commons, Jonathan Adler who recently opened at Santa Monica Place and Kendra Scott who's coming to La Encantada. 
Finally, we continue to experience growth in the fast-casual and full-service restaurant categories. During the first quarter, we signed leases with Shake Shack at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Queens Center, bringing our portfolio total to 4 units. We also signed deals with Cheesecake Factory at Los Cerritos in Santa Monica. Both properties are adding state-of-the-art theaters. We also continued to expand our presence with more traditional players like Chipotle, Starbucks and Teavana. 
Regarding 2014 bankruptcies, we've made great progress with the re-leasing of Coldwater Creek, Juicy and Love Culture. Within our portfolio, there were a combined 27 locations containing approximately 170,000 square feet. To date, deals have been completed on approximately 80% of the spaces. While impacting our occupancy in the short term, we have significantly improved the quality of the tenancy and the productivity from these spaces. New tenants signed for these locations are illustrative of who is active in the marketplace. Deals completed include ANTHROPOLOGIE, Hanna Andersson, Vera Bradley, Pandora, Michael Kors, Soft Surroundings, ivivva, St. John's, UNIQLO, Kiehl's and H&M. 
Bankruptcies during the first quarter included Wet Seal, Radio Shack, Cache, Deb Shops and Body Shop. In total, these store closures included 52 locations with approximately 113,000 square feet. This impacted the portfolio occupancy by about 50 basis points in Q1. 
Looking forward, we believe there are opportunities to increase revenues by: one, increasing our total occupancy while continuing to reduce temporary tenant occupancy levels; two, significantly increasing the revenue generation and presentation quality within the common areas; and three, maximizing our leasing spreads based on the continued improvement of the portfolio of quality. 
In summary, we believe our portfolio is well positioned in the current retail environment with many must-have locations for retailers in both traditional mall and outlet center format."

As you could tell, we have great -- we have a terrific quarter and our outlook for the future and the balance of this year on the operating front is extremely strong. While the focus today on our call is on the business and opera",1547,"Thank you, Bobby and Tom. As you could tell, we have great -- we have a terrific quarter and our outlook for the future and the balance of this year on the operating front is extremely strong. While the focus today on our call is on the business and operating and financial results, I would like to make a few brief comments with respect to recent developments. We would then like to keep the remainder of the call focused on our strong earnings performance and guidance. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on our results and outlook. 
First, I want to highlight that we always seek to maintain open communication with our shareholders and we value their viewpoints. Over the past 2 months, together with our Lead Director, Fred Hubbell, we have spent a significant amount of time speaking with and listening to the majority of our top 30 shareholders. One of the consistent comments from these meetings is that our shareholders want us to remain focused on the business to ensure that we continue driving outsized returns. This is our top priority, and I can tell you that our entire organization is engaged and energized with a singular focus on performance and shareholder returns. You will see that as Tom and I continue to share with you the results during the balance of this call and discuss with you a number of our new and recent initiatives. 
In addition, our shareholders have also expressed their viewpoints on governance, including the difficult decisions that we made in light of the takeover attempt. The board did not take these -- or make these decisions lightly. The board only implemented governance changes because it believed they were essential to protecting shareholder value. We continue to solicit shareholder feedback on this topic and intend to announce several changes in the near future that we believe will further demonstrate the board's ongoing commitment to sound corporate governance. Again, these will be announced in the near future. We're not prepared to get into the details on them today. 
I also want to briefly address the nominations that we have received and related litigation. As the litigation is pending, we will not be commenting further on it today. In summary, and as noted in our preliminary proxy, we notified The New York Stock Exchange of the record date for the 2015 Annual Meeting would be March 20, 2015. Land and Buildings was not a shareholder on March 20. It acquired 1,100 shares after the record date, on March 25 and 26, and submitted its nominations on March 31. We advised them privately because -- that because they were not a stockholder of record on March 20 that their submission was defective. The rules to nominate candidates are the same for all stockholders and this matter is now pending before the courts. 
Now I'd like to turn to picking up on the results of our quarter and our prognosis for the balance of the year. As you can see from the numbers that Tom shared with you that you've read and the color that Bobby gave you, we had a terrific quarter and we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth and value creation at Macerich over the balance of this year and into the future. We believe that the company is at an important inflection point with outsized growth coming over the next several years as we reap the benefits of the significant investments we have made in portfolio management and the transformation of our portfolio. And particular note, it is nice to see that our average sales per foot today on our entire portfolio is an excess of $600 a square foot. 
We believe that our focus on the following 5 major initiatives will play an important role in our ability to continue to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders. Five initiatives are to continue to drive same-center NOI growth at above average rates; to improve our operating margins and have margin expansion; portfolio management is number three; I'm going to be talking about number four, the Sears joint venture that was just announced this morning by Sears; and number five, our ongoing developments. 
In terms of same-center NOI growth. Due to the pruning of our portfolio and the reinvestment of that capital into our highly productive core portfolio, we see the opportunity for superior same-center NOI growth both this year and in the years to come. Our targeted same-center NOI growth is now, for this year, budgeted and guided to be 4.5% to 5% and represents a significant acceleration from past years. 
Number two. Another major initiative that, frankly, is the result of a wake-up call on this topic is operating margin expansion. In addition to the same-center NOI growth that we anticipate, we also see the opportunity in -- to increase our operating margins, both this year and next. We believe that, in the very foreseeable future, which I'm looking out over 24 months, that we have the opportunity to increase our operating margins by at least 400 basis points. Primarily, this will be done through a combination of efficiency projects as well as enhancing the common areas of our malls to improve the customer experience and increase incremental revenues from that area. 
Three, portfolio management and capital recycling. We are currently taking inbounds and sending outbounds to examine opportunities to monetize assets within our portfolio, both through joint ventures as well as through dispositions and to redeploy those proceeds into the most profitable vehicle available to us at that point in time. We think that through asset monetization and portfolio management that, that will help many of you to -- help to get better transparency and improve your view of the NAV of the company and we believe that it will validate the view of the NAV of the company that management has and that our board concluded. 
Number  four, the Sears joint venture. This was just concluded late last night. In that transaction, we entered into a transaction very similar to the ones that Sears entered into with 2 of our other peers. We are entering into a joint venture for the redevelopment of 9 Sears locations that are presently owned and controlled by Sears. This is a 50-50 joint venture and gives us the right to recapture 50% of the GLA that Sears occupies and to redeploy that. We are investing $150 million into this joint venture and anticipate just north of a 6% return on our investment in the beginning year with opportunities to profitably reinvest into this joint venture as we identify recycling and redevelopment opportunities at these 9 locations. I would point out that the 9 locations that we entered into a joint venture with Sears on have average sales per square foot at the mall itself of $680 a square foot. The locations are Arrowhead and Chandler in Phoenix, Danbury in Connecticut; Deptford, New Jersey; Freehold, New Jersey; Los Cerritos in Southern California; South Plains in Lubbock; Vintage Faire, Modesto; and Washington Square in the Portland -- Greater Portland market. In addition, concurrently with that transaction, we also entered into an agreement with Sears that gives us the right to recapture the 300,000-square-foot store at Kings Plaza with an 180 days prior notice. That really will jump-start the next phase of the Kings Plaza redevelopment and we're just finishing up the remodeling and remerchandising of the mall and we're in talks today with -- for the addition  of 2 to 3 new anchors and/or junior anchors to be redeploy that Sears square footage. We see great opportunities there. 
Moving into the development area. I'm not going to go through each of our development pipeline activities because I want to leave plenty of time for questions. I would just comment upon one in particular and that is Tysons Corner. It is now coming to completion in terms of the densification project. Our board had a meeting at Tysons Corner last week and I would encourage you, all, to get an opportunity the next time you're in the marketplace to take a look at what we have accomplished there. Our office complex is now over 85% leased. The hotel is open. The residential tower is having tenants begin to move in this weekend. The tower is already 25% preleased, which is significantly above what our residential fee developer had projected at rents that are above our pro forma and are at the top of the market in the marketplace. 
So in summary, we are extremely bullish on our prospects. We think that we have a very clear plan to continue to deliver shareholder value and we look forward to discussing that plan and delivering on that plan over the months to come. 
Again, as a reminder, our call today is to discuss our results for the quarter recently ended. We are happy to address any questions about financial and operating results, redevelopment initiatives, pipeline and outlook, but we will not be commenting further on the other matters that I discussed earlier about governance and other -- and litigation. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. 
And operator, we'd like to now open it up for Q&A."

So again, like I mentioned, we had a wake-up call, obviously, in November when this topic was first brought to the conversation in conjunction with the unsolicited takeover attempt.

So again, like I mentioned, we had a wake-up call, obviously, in November when this topic was first brought to the conversation in conjunction with the unsolicited takeover attempt. And we did a big soul-searching and said, are there ways that we can improve our margins? We have some systemic issues with some of our margins where we do business in major urban marketplaces where the cost of doing business is extremely high, primarily from real estate taxes and infrastructure costs and those margins will always be different than a suburban location, but the revenues and the sales make up for it. So the bottom line is the profitability of the mall, and the urban malls generate huge NOIs even though the margins on balance may not look as attractive as a suburban mall. But having said that, we did come to the conclusion that we could, in fact, through a combination of initiatives and there are dozens and dozens and dozens of initiatives that add up to getting to the ability to increase our margins by 400 basis points, some of them are cost-saving initiatives, some of them are revenue-generating initiatives in a multitude of different areas. But I think that, clearly, there's an opportunity, which we have been working on anyway through the middle of last year and into the end of last year into elevating the common area experience in our malls, which includes many different initiatives to improve the customer experience, things like eliminating customer service booths and going to either a virtual concierge or a roving concierges and then replacing those service booths with revenue-generating retailers. And through a combination of really expense reductions and common area revenue enhancements, we clearly see that, over the next 24 months, that there's about a 400 basis point operating margin expansion available to us. I would say that about 100 basis points of that is pretty well baked into our guidance for this year, but there's still lots of upside to be derived in that arena."

Actually, we first approached Sears with the idea of doing a joint venture on their real estate as opposed to them trying to monetize it or build up a development department themselves back in a personal meeting I had with Eddie Lampert on December 10. I guess you could say opportunity, unfortunately, I got a little distracted over the coming months from being able to finish our joint venture. But I guess I can thank -- we kind of planted to seed with Eddie and others helped to cultivate the tree and now we are kind of picking the apples off the tree. So we identified the 9 locations that we thought had the most upside in terms of what we could really demonstrate to each other in terms of value. We agreed on those 9 locations. And then collateral to that conversation, we talked about several leased locations and one in particular that we had an immediate need for and appetite for and that they were willing to cooperate with us on was Kings Plaza. So you're right. If you look at the way Green Street    has their database, all of the 9 locations that we did joint ventures on were A+ to A- type of malls. But more importantly, since we disclosed sales per foot by property versus others, you can see and know that our 9 locations do $680 a square foot, which, if you compare that to the database that Green Street has on the other transactions, is a different, a significant notch above in quality. So again, I mean, look, we're very happy to this with Sears. We think it's a very positive step in terms of helping them rationalize. And we think there's a lot of upside for the company and it is immediately accretive to this year's earnings."

And I think there's going to be an opportunity here to really validate our view on the value of our portfolio while creating significant liquidity of the -- for the company, achieving portfolio management by, hopefully, also recycling out of some lower-growth assets into higher growth and then the ultimate redeployment of that capital, which we anticipate could be quite significant will be determined to be whatever is the smartest use of that capital at the point in time that the monetization has been accomplished.

Eastdil said, look, if we were selling these assets, this is the forward 12-month cash flow that we would expect a buyer to pay for. So if you take that real estate income, which again, that's a disclosure that you're not going to find it in our supplement, it's not a GAAP number. It's a number that people would use in the buying or selling of property. And then you can apply different cap rates to that number. If you want to apply a cap rate that our unsolicited buyer -- bidder applied to our historical NOI of a 4% cap rate, you do the math and that takes up between $112 and $115 a share. If you want to take a 4.5% cap rate, it takes it around $95 a share. And then, look, one thing I do know is that everybody has an opinion on cap rates and they're entitled to that opinion.

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean Wood. 
It was another very strong quarter. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results of all the major portfolio transformation that we've been through the past 2 years, including the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that capital into more productive, faster-growing assets. Leasing spreads were good again this quarter. We signed 321,000 square feet of leases, positive re-leasing spread of 21% over the trailing 12 months. Mall occupancy hit a high level at 95.4%, which was up 30 basis points compared to March 31 of last year. In looking at the temporary occupancy, we continued to reduce that, that was 5.2%. That compared to 5.5% at March 31 of last year. We'll continue to focus on that area. We continue to see the potential to grow NOI as a result of converting that temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. Average mall base rents increased to $54.19, that was up 10% from a year ago. 
FFO for the quarter was at $0.79 compared to $0.81 for the prior year. Reflected in there was $2.2 million of gain on early extinguishment of debt on Lakewood. Going the other direction was $13.6 million of expenses related to an unsolicited takeover attempt. Excluding the gain on extinguishment as well as the expenses, FFO came in at $0.86 a share for the quarter, ahead of both our guidance and the consensus estimates. 
Impacting the quarter was same-center NOI growth at a sector-leading 5% compared to last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
The gross margin improved to 66.6%, that was up from 64.9% a year ago, again also driven by occupancy gain with a strong leasing environment, including the second half of last year rent bumps as well as expense reductions in the first quarter this year. 
Bad debt expense was up slightly to $1.6 million compared to $800,000 last year in the first quarter. Much of that was driven by RadioShack and Wet Seal. 
The average interest rate continued to go down. It was 3.5% at quarter-end compared to 4.1% at March 31, 2014. 
The balance sheet's in great shape. We had the strongest balance sheet that we've had in the history of our company. At quarter-end, the various balance sheet metrics were: debt-to-market cap, 33%; interest coverage ratio, 3.5x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.4 years; floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt was 19%, that is somewhat artificially high as we paid off Lakewood during the quarter and we'll be refinancing that with a permanent loan. We have agreed to a $410 million loan, 11 years, 3.43% fixed rate and that's going to be funded this quarter and the proceeds will be used to pay down the line of credit. In addition, we're in the market to put a long-term fixed-rate loan on the unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. Those proceeds will be in the neighborhood of $320 million to $340 million and those proceeds will also be used primarily to pay down our line of credit.
In the press release this morning, based on a strong first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year, we bumped our FFO guidance range up to $3.83 to $3.93. Also embedded in that increase was an increase in our assumption of same-center NOI growth, which we bumped 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5% on average for the year. 
We had good tenant sales growth during the quarter. The average portfolio sales per foot for the trailing 12 months was $607, that compared to $565 a year ago. If you look at it on a same-center basis, excluding dispositions that happened over the course of the last 12 months, the same-center sales were $604 and that compared to $579 on a same-center basis for an increase of 4.3%. 
Strongest regions for us were again California and Arizona, which were both up strong. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment."

The first quarter leasing activity was solid, generating above-average leasing spreads on good velocity. We continue to see retailers invest their capital into the following venues: A mall locations, outlet centers, flagship locations and omni-channel retail initiatives. The quality of The Macerich portfolio is consistent with the retailer objectives, which is demonstrated in the above-average operating metrics. 
Areas of strength within the portfolio included: one, large-format retailers and anchor retailers. During Q1, over 400,000 square feet of new leases were executed with retailers over 10,000 square feet. Some of the notable deals completed during the first quarter included Century 21 at Green Acres Mall and Restoration Hardware Gallery who will construct a 50,000-square-foot building at The Village at Corte Madera, which is the company's hometown. 
Secondly, we are seeing the expansion of core brands from retailers with larger store fleets. Throughout the portfolio, retailers such L Brands, Foot Locker, Luxottica, Kay Jewelers and Sephora are expanding their square footages and developing new formats. Within our portfolio, these core tenants represented significant amount of the square footage and the strength of their business benefits our centers. 
Thirdly, there is continued growth from a foreign-based retailers. Demand for space within the center is high as the U.S. markets are viewed favorably with good growth prospects in the coming years. Most of the attention falls on the fast-fashion retailers, which include H&M, Zara and UNIQLO. Within our portfolio, we have been active with all 3, including 2 new deals signed during Q1 with Zara at Broadway Plaza and The Oaks. While much of the attention is rightly focused on these 3 players, we also see activity from foreign-based retailers, including adidas, Kooples, Garage, Camper, lululemon, Nespresso, KIKO, Gerry Weber, Jo Malone, Michael Hill, and importantly, Primark. 
Next, while more limited in their store openings, we see demand from emerging specialty brands on either a stand-alone basis or within the umbrella of larger retail companies. Examples of larger retail companies developing new brands, which generate store expansions include: lululemon's development with ivivva, Gap's expansion of Athleta, Ann Taylor's development of Lou & Grey, H&M's development of & Other Stories, and Macy's purchase of Bluemercury. 
Newer stand-alone concepts that we have completed deals with include Kidmates who have signed on to the Broadway Plaza expansion, Soft Surroundings who signed 3 leases during the quarter, Yellow Box who recently opened at Kierland Commons, Jonathan Adler who recently opened at Santa Monica Place and Kendra Scott who's coming to La Encantada. 
Finally, we continue to experience growth in the fast-casual and full-service restaurant categories. During the first quarter, we signed leases with Shake Shack at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Queens Center, bringing our portfolio total to 4 units. We also signed deals with Cheesecake Factory at Los Cerritos in Santa Monica. Both properties are adding state-of-the-art theaters. We also continued to expand our presence with more traditional players like Chipotle, Starbucks and Teavana. 
Regarding 2014 bankruptcies, we've made great progress with the re-leasing of Coldwater Creek, Juicy and Love Culture. Within our portfolio, there were a combined 27 locations containing approximately 170,000 square feet. To date, deals have been completed on approximately 80% of the spaces. While impacting our occupancy in the short term, we have significantly improved the quality of the tenancy and the productivity from these spaces. New tenants signed for these locations are illustrative of who is active in the marketplace. Deals completed include ANTHROPOLOGIE, Hanna Andersson, Vera Bradley, Pandora, Michael Kors, Soft Surroundings, ivivva, St. John's, UNIQLO, Kiehl's and H&M. 
Bankruptcies during the first quarter included Wet Seal, Radio Shack, Cache, Deb Shops and Body Shop. In total, these store closures included 52 locations with approximately 113,000 square feet. This impacted the portfolio occupancy by about 50 basis points in Q1. 
Looking forward, we believe there are opportunities to increase revenues by: one, increasing our total occupancy while continuing to reduce temporary tenant occupancy levels; two, significantly increasing the revenue generation and presentation quality within the common areas; and three, maximizing our leasing spreads based on the continued improvement of the portfolio quality. 
In summary, we believe our portfolio is well positioned in the current retail environment with many must-have locations for retailers in both traditional mall and outlet center format."

As you could tell, we have great -- we have a terrific quarter and our outlook for the future and the balance of this year on the operating front is extremely strong. While the focus today on our call is on the business and opera",1546,"Thank you, Bobby and Tom. As you could tell, we have great -- we have a terrific quarter and our outlook for the future and the balance of this year on the operating front is extremely strong. While the focus today on our call is on the business and operating and financial results, I would like to make a few brief comments with respect to recent developments. We would then like to keep the remainder of the call focused on our strong earnings performance and guidance. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on our results and outlook. 
First, I want to highlight that we always seek to maintain open communication with our shareholders and we value their viewpoints. Over the past 2 months, together with our Lead Director, Fred Hubbell, we have spent a significant amount of time speaking with and listening to the majority of our top 30 shareholders. One of the consistent comments from these meetings is that our shareholders want us to remain focused on the business to ensure that we continue driving outsized returns. This is our top priority, and I can tell you that our entire organization is engaged and energized with a singular focus on performance and shareholder returns. You will see that as Tom and I continue to share with you the results during the balance of this call and discuss with you a number of our new and recent initiatives. 
In addition, our shareholders have also expressed their viewpoints on governance, including the difficult decisions that we made in light of the takeover attempt. The board did not take these -- or make these decisions lightly. The board only implemented governance changes because it believed they were essential to protecting shareholder value. We continue to solicit shareholder feedback on this topic and intend to announce several changes in the near future that we believe will further demonstrate the board's ongoing commitment to sound corporate governance. Again, these will be announced in the near future. We're not prepared to get into the details on them today. 
I also want to briefly address the nominations that we have received and related litigation. As the litigation is pending, we will not be commenting further on it today. In summary, and as noted in our preliminary proxy, we notified The New York Stock Exchange of the record date for the 2015 Annual Meeting would be March 20, 2015. Land and Buildings was not a shareholder on March 20. It acquired 1,100 shares after the record date, on March 25 and 26, and submitted its nominations on March 31. We advised them privately because -- that because they were not a stockholder of record on March 20 that their submission was defective. The rules to nominate candidates are the same for all stockholders and this matter is now pending before the courts. 
Now I'd like to turn to picking up on the results of our quarter and our prognosis for the balance of the year. As you can see from the numbers that Tom shared with you that you've read and the color that Bobby gave you, we had a terrific quarter and we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth and value creation at Macerich over the balance of this year and into the future. We believe that the company is at an important inflection point with outsized growth coming over the next several years as we reap the benefits of the significant investments we have made in portfolio management and the transformation of our portfolio. And particular note, it is nice to see that our average sales per foot today on our entire portfolio is an excess of $600 a square foot. 
We believe that our focus on the following 5 major initiatives will play an important role in our ability to continue to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders. Five initiatives are to continue to drive same-center NOI growth at above average rates; to improve our operating margins and have margin expansion; portfolio management is number three; I'm going to be talking about number four, the Sears joint venture that was just announced this morning by Sears; and number five, our ongoing developments. 
In terms of same-center NOI growth. Due to the pruning of our portfolio and the reinvestment of that capital into our highly productive core portfolio, we see the opportunity for superior same-center NOI growth both this year and in the years to come. Our targeted same-center NOI growth is now, for this year, budgeted and guided to be 4.5% to 5% and represents a significant acceleration from past years. 
Number two. Another major initiative that, frankly, is the result of a wake-up call on this topic is operating margin expansion. In addition to the same-center NOI growth that we anticipate, we also see the opportunity in -- to increase our operating margins, both this year and next. We believe that, in the very foreseeable future, which I'm looking out over 24 months, that we have the opportunity to increase our operating margins by at least 400 basis points. Primarily, this will be done through a combination of efficiency projects as well as enhancing the common areas of our malls to improve the customer experience and increase incremental revenues from that area. 
Three, portfolio management and capital recycling. We are currently taking inbounds and sending outbounds to examine opportunities to monetize assets within our portfolio, both through joint ventures as well as through dispositions and to redeploy those proceeds into the most profitable vehicle available to us at that point in time. We think that through asset monetization and portfolio management that, that will help many of you to -- help to get better transparency and improve your view of the NAV of the company and we believe that it will validate the view of the NAV of the company that management has and that our board concluded. 
Number  four, the Sears joint venture. This was just concluded late last night. In that transaction, we entered into a transaction very similar to the ones that Sears entered into with 2 of our other peers. We are entering into a joint venture for the redevelopment of 9 Sears locations that are presently owned and controlled by Sears. This is a 50-50 joint venture and gives us the right to recapture 50% of the GLA that Sears occupies and to redeploy that. We are investing $150 million into this joint venture and anticipate just north of a 6% return on our investment in the beginning year with opportunities to profitably reinvest into this joint venture as we identify recycling and redevelopment opportunities at these 9 locations. I would point out that the 9 locations that we entered into a joint venture with Sears on have average sales per square foot at the mall itself of $680 a square foot. The locations are Arrowhead and Chandler in Phoenix, Danbury in Connecticut; Deptford, New Jersey; Freehold, New Jersey; Los Cerritos in Southern California; South Plains in Lubbock; Vintage Faire, Modesto; and Washington Square in the Portland -- Greater Portland market. In addition, concurrently with that transaction, we also entered into an agreement with Sears that gives us the right to recapture the 300,000-square-foot store at Kings Plaza with 180 days prior notice. That really will jump-start the next phase of the Kings Plaza redevelopment and we're just finishing up the remodeling and remerchandising of the mall and we're in talks today with -- for the addition of 2 to 3 new anchors and/or junior anchors to be redeploy that Sears square footage. We see great opportunities there. 
Moving into the development area. I'm not going to go through each of our development pipeline activities because I want to leave plenty of time for questions. I would just comment upon one in particular and that is Tysons Corner. It is now coming to completion in terms of the densification project. Our board had a meeting at Tysons Corner last week and I would encourage you, all, to get an opportunity the next time you're in the marketplace to take a look at what we have accomplished there. Our office complex is now over 85% leased. The hotel is open. The residential tower is having tenants begin to move in this weekend. The tower is already 25% preleased, which is significantly above what our residential fee developer had projected at rents that are above our pro forma and are at the top of the market in the marketplace. 
So in summary, we are extremely bullish on our prospects. We think that we have a very clear plan to continue to deliver shareholder value and we look forward to discussing that plan and delivering on that plan over the months to come. 
Again, as a reminder, our call today is to discuss our results for the quarter recently ended. We are happy to address any questions about financial and operating results, redevelopment initiatives, pipeline and outlook, but we will not be commenting further on the other matters that I discussed earlier about governance and other -- and litigation. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. 
And operator, we'd like to now open it up for Q&A."

So again, like I mentioned, we had a wake-up call, obviously, in November when this topic was first brought to the conversation in conjunction with the unsolicited takeover attempt.

So again, like I mentioned, we had a wake-up call, obviously, in November when this topic was first brought to the conversation in conjunction with the unsolicited takeover attempt. And we did a big soul-searching and said, are there ways that we can improve our margins? We have some systemic issues with some of our margins where we do business in major urban marketplaces where the cost of doing business is extremely high, primarily from real estate taxes and infrastructure costs and those margins will always be different than a suburban location, but the revenues and the sales make up for it. So the bottom line is the profitability of the mall, and the urban malls generate huge NOIs even though the margins on balance may not look as attractive as a suburban mall. But having said that, we did come to the conclusion that we could, in fact, through a combination of initiatives and there are dozens and dozens and dozens of initiatives that add up to getting to the ability to increase our margins by 400 basis points, some of them are cost-saving initiatives, some of them are revenue-generating initiatives in a multitude of different areas. But I think that, clearly, there's an opportunity, which we have been working on anyway through the middle of last year and into the end of last year into elevating the common area experience in our malls, which includes many different initiatives to improve the customer experience, things like eliminating customer service booths and going to either a virtual concierge or a roving concierges and then replacing those service booths with revenue-generating retailers. And through a combination of really expense reductions and common area revenue enhancements, we clearly see that, over the next 24 months, that there's about a 400 basis point operating margin expansion available to us. I would say that about 100 basis points of that is pretty well baked into our guidance for this year, but there's still lots of upside to be derived in that arena."

Actually, we first approached Sears with the idea of doing a joint venture on their real estate as opposed to them trying to monetize it or build up a development department themselves back in a personal meeting I had with Eddie Lampert on December 10. I guess you could say opportunity, unfortunately, I got a little distracted over the coming months from being able to finish our joint venture. But I guess I can thank -- we kind of planted to seed with Eddie and others helped to cultivate the tree and now we are kind of picking the apples off the tree. So we identified the 9 locations that we thought had the most upside in terms of what we could really demonstrate to each other in terms of value. We agreed on those 9 locations. And then collateral to that conversation, we talked about several leased locations and one in particular that we had an immediate need for and appetite for and that they were willing to cooperate with us on was Kings Plaza. So you're right. If you look at the way Green Street    has their database, all of the 9 locations that we did joint ventures on were A+ to A- type of malls. But more importantly, since we disclosed sales per foot by property versus others, you can see and know that our 9 locations do $680 a square foot, which, if you compare that to the database that Green Street has on the other transactions, is a different, a significant notch above in quality. So again, I mean, look, we're very happy to do this with Sears. We think it's a very positive step in terms of helping them rationalize. And we think there's a lot of upside for the company and it is immediately accretive to this year's earnings."

We're also talking to a number of very significant core type of investors on the possibility of doing some joint ventures. And this is really on the joint venture side of it, a lot of that is driven by an appetite, I think, to help all of you that are on this call to update your thinking on NAVs. And we do believe that we would have a great use of proceeds for that capital if and when we do it. But I think, look, there is definitely an appetite for, I think, somebody wrote this morning, “show me the money,” to show you the money, to monetize some assets, to demonstrate values and so we're -- we had a number of inbound indications of interest and we've reached out to a couple of our core investors that we currently do business with. And I think there's going to be an opportunity here to really validate our view on the value of our portfolio while creating significant liquidity of the -- for the company, achieving portfolio management by, hopefully, also recycling out of some lower-growth assets into higher growth and then the ultimate redeployment of that capital, which we anticipate could be quite significant will be determined to be whatever is the smartest use of that capital at the point in time that the monetization has been accomplished.

Eastdil said, look, if we were selling these assets, this is the forward 12-month cash flow that we would expect a buyer to pay for. So if you take that real estate income, which again, that's a disclosure that you're not going to find it in our supplement, it's not a GAAP number. It's a number that people would use in the buying or selling of property. And then you can apply different cap rates to that number. If you want to apply a cap rate that our unsolicited buyer -- bidder applied to our historical NOI of a 4% cap rate, you do the math and that takes up between $112 and $115 a share. If you want to take a 4.5% cap rate, it takes it around $95 a share. And then, look, one thing I do know is that everybody has an opinion on cap rates and they're entitled to that opinion.

Getting them up on the third floor will be the key to build momentum around them. Probably the most important impact we've seen is Cheesecake Factory, which, as you know, is also requires a lot of volume and a lot of bodies going through their space. They've signed a lease for 12,000 feet there under construction. They'll open at the same time as the theater.

It was another very strong quarter for us. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results from all the major portfolio transformation we have done over the 2 years. This includes the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that capital to the more productive, faster-growing assets. 
Leasing spreads were good again this quarter, and we saw strong deal volume, 335,000 square feet of shop spaces, and the average positive re-leasing spread compared to the expiring rent was 17.5%. 
Mall occupancy was again very high at 95.5%, up 10 basis points from a year ago as well as up 10 basis points sequentially from last quarter. Temporary occupancy remained relatively flat at 5.3%, up slightly from 5.2% at June 30 of '14. 
In light of the very significant retail bankruptcies in the second half of last year and early '15, these are very good occupancy results. Average mall store-based rents increased to $53.62. That was up 9% from a year ago. 
Looking at FFO. For the quarter, we reported this morning FFO of $0.89 per share. That compared to $0.86 in the second quarter of 2014. Reflected in FFO was a $1.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as $11.4 million of expense related to an unsolicited takeover attempt and contested proxy. Together, they make up $0.08 a share. 
Excluding those 2 items, FFO was $0.97 per share for the quarter, ahead of with our guidance range and consensus estimates. Same-center NOI during the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the second quarter of last year, and year-to-date, same-center NOI growth is up 6.29%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management program put into place this year. 
The results through midyear have led us to increase our same-center guidance range assumptions, up 100 basis points to 5.5% to 6% for the full year. As a result of the increase in same-center NOI, we saw nice lift in the gross operating margin. Our gross margin increased to 69.8%, up from 67% in the second quarter of 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was $2 million, slightly higher than last year in the second quarter, where we incurred $1.7 million of bad debt expense. 
During the quarter, the average interest rate was down to 3.47% compared to 4.11% a year ago. And if you look at the other balance sheet metrics, debt to market cap at quarter end was 36.9%. We had a very healthy interest coverage ratio of 3.7x. Debt to EBITDA on a forward basis is 7.2, and average debt maturity of 5.5 years, and the financing market continues to be strong, and we'll continue to be that market. We have a number of high quality assets that have been unencumbered recently and are candidates for long-term fixed-rate financing. They include Fresno Fashion Fair, South Plains Mall, Inland Center as well as 29th Street in Boulder. 
In today's press release, we, as a result of the strong first half results and outlook for the balance of the year, we bumped and narrowed our FFO guidance range. We increased to $3.86 to $3.94, and that's up from the prior guidance of $3.83 to $3.93 per share. 
Bringing tenant sales, a good quarter there as well. The portfolio mall tenant net sales per foot were up 10% to $623 a foot for the year ended June 30, 2015. That compared to $567 for the year ended June 30, 2014. 
On a same-center basis, sales per foot were $619 and that compared -- up 6.5% to $581 at June 30, 2014. Again, during the period, Arizona and California were top regions for us in terms of sales per square foot. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment."
332172,305002760,837478,"The Macerich Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","The Macerich Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As Tom indicated, the second quarter leasing methods were good. Leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months were up 17.5%. Occupancy rose by 10 basis points to 95.5%. Sales reached $623 a foot. Bankruptcies moderated significantly from the p",688,"Thanks, Tom. As Tom indicated, the second quarter leasing methods were good. Leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months were up 17.5%. Occupancy rose by 10 basis points to 95.5%. Sales reached $623 a foot. 
Bankruptcies moderated significantly from the previous quarter, and our signed leases for tenants over 10,000 square feet were strong, with over 450,000 square feet signed during the quarter, including 3 locations with H&M. 
Demand from retailers for the company's mall locations and outlet venues continues to be positive. We see retailers seeking to tie in multichannel retail opportunity and further establish their brand identity. In addition, we see emerging brands and foreign retailers entering the U.S. through store locations, which are typically on the East and West Coast, and that aligns with our portfolio. 
Tenant bankruptcies during the first quarter provided significant headwinds with 8 national retailers declaring bankruptcy. These tenants affected 76 stores containing approximately 247,000 square feet, which generated sales of only $241 per square foot. Included were larger chains such as Radio Shack, Wet Seal and Cache. Some of this impact has been mitigated with approximately 46% of the space either leased or approved and in lease documentation. 
We have seen and expect to continue to see some retailers with large store fleets reduce their store count. This is illustrated by Gap's recent announcement to close 175 stores. Most of these store closures are effectuated through natural lease expirations as opposed to lease buyouts. We continue to believe the quality of the company's portfolio reduces the impact from both bankruptcies and store closures, which we believe will be felt disproportionally in the lower-quality centers. 
Leasing progress continues to be made at Broadway Plaza located in Walnut Creek, California. The initial portion of the first phase will open this November with 22 spaces containing 45,000 square feet. We currently have leases executed for 20 of the spaces or 91%. The remaining 2 spaces we expect to sign leases shortly. 
Some of the tenants will be part of the initial phase and new to the center include lululemon, Kidmates, Michael Kors, Made Well, Kiehl's, Lou & Grey, Athleta and Vince Camuto. The balance of the first phase will open in May '16 and contain approximately 150,000 square feet. We expect to make a more detailed announcement on the tenancy later this year. 
Significant resources are also being applied to improving the quality and revenue generation from the common area of the shopping center. Sources of revenues include permitting kiosks and seasonal carts as well as advertising and sponsorships. As the portfolio has migrated to fewer but more dominant centers, these opportunities will grow and will result in improved operating margins. 
Through the second quarter, the number of deals approved has doubled as compared to the previous year. The majority of this impact will be felt in 2016 when the leases annualized. 
An example of this has been the conversion from stationary guest service kiosk into mobile concierges, including text responses to customers' inquiries. This has not only improved the customer service -- the customer experience, but has also allowed us convert the former guest kiosk, which are often the best locations within the shopping center, into rent-paying retailers. 
Another example of this is at Santa Monica Place, where the new no ArcLight Theatre will present significant advertising opportunities for major motion picture releases. 
Lastly, to comment on sales, year-to-date sales through the second quarter have reached $623 per square foot. The increase is attributed to a couple of factors, including the improvement in many of the key tenant sales, including people like Sephora, American Eagle, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret; secondly, through the impact of high-volume retailers like Apple and Tesla; third, the closure of low-volume stores such as Radio Shack, Wet Seal and Cache; and finally, the disposition of lower productivity centers. 
In summary, we believe our portfolio offers retailers with key locations in major markets that serve dense trade areas. These opportunities will increase in importance to omni-channel retailers that have either existing store fleet or attempting to build store basis. 
And with that, I would turn it over to Art."

We're very pleased with our operating results and with all of our metrics that we have put up here for the first 6 months. And as you can see by our guidance adjustment, we're very bullish about our future midterm as well as longer-term outlook. 
Same-center NOI is significantly above the guidance, even the high end of the guidance range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and one might ask what is the new normal? As I look at it, Tom mentioned that he sees total same-center NOI of around 6% on the portfolio this year, and we're not in a position yet to give guidance for 2016 and '17, but we internally are expecting to see same-center NOI growth in that same range of 6% over the next couple of years also. 
And that's largely been put into place as a consequence of re-leasing activity, a consequence of the margin improvement, some of which are yet to come, particularly on the revenue side, but we're very, very bullish on our ability to improve our margins. 
It was asked by one analyst, ""Well, have you really changed your business practices on the expense side to increase your margins,"" and the answer is, is really no. We were fortunate enough this year to have a couple of major portfolio contracts for maintenance security, for example, come up for renewal. And given the strength of our portfolio and the quality of the assets and the size of the assets, we were able to negotiate significant reductions there as well as in other areas. 
So we're very pleased about all of our operating metrics and the performance of the company and the outlook for the future on the leasing side. 
On the development side, Bob and Tom both touched on a couple of projects that are very meaningful to us, very happy with where we are on Broadway Plaza. At Tysons Corner, you are invited to a tour that's coming up here in the near future. 
The residential tower is now taking move-ins. It is currently well leased above scheduled. It's currently 33% leased, and we anticipate it being fully leased by this time next year. 
As we look at other major projects that are underway, Scottsdale Fashion Square, the Dick's Sporting Goods recently opened. They're doing very well. Harkins opens up later this year. This same combination of additional anchors are going to be opening up later this year at Cerritos and early next year at Cerritos. 
Very pleased with the impact that the announcement and the construction and the reality of the ArcLight Cinema has had on the third level of Santa Monica Place, which is actually also helped us to land a signature restaurant that will be coming to the third level of Santa Monica Place, and we expect it'll generate tremendous amount of traffic. 
At Green Acres, the leasing on Green Acres commons, the contiguous space that we are building on the land that we acquired there is coming along extremely well. Pre-leasing activity, both at Fashion Outlets in Philadelphia to The Gallery at Market East, coming along well as is San Francisco. 
The last earnings call, we were on the heels of just announcing our joint venture with Sears on 9 assets. We have been meeting with Sears and the people. We are very pleased to have the opportunity to redevelop it and reposition those 9 assets, and we anticipate over the next 60 to 90 days that we'll be in a position to make more concrete announcements about what's happening within the Sears portfolio with us and the rationalization, but very happy with where we sit there, and in particular, we could be seeing some pretty significant reconfigurations and re-merchandising and developments available to us at Cerritos and Washington Square, in particular, both rate centers and centers where we have the ability to recapture over 200,000 square feet from Sears, and each of them, Sears controls a 20-acre parcel of land that we're looking at various ideas for various expansions. So very bullish on where we are, pleased with our results year-to-date. 
And at this point, we'd like to open it up for Q&A."

I anticipate that over the next 30 to 60 days, we will be in a position to provide more color on that. It'll predominantly take the form of some new joint ventures on existing assets, and the profile of the assets that are being looked at is really a very broad cross-section of the company that if you take, for example, one metric, which would be sales per foot are virtually identical to the overall performance of the company as a whole. So the pool of assets that we're looking at include one asset that's in our top 10, 2 assets that are in our group of 11 through 20, a couple of assets that are in a group of 21 through 30 as well as a couple of assets that are in our group of 31 to 40. So it's a broad cross-section. We're in what sixth or seventh inning of conversations. We're very gratified that the initial value indications that these institutional investors, who will be taking minority noncontrol positions, not only validate the board's opinion of value of the company that they reach with the assistance of its advisers back in March but actually exceed those numbers, and we're looking forward to being able to announce the results of that asset and that monetization activity over the next 30 to 60 days. As we mentioned in previous calls, we will use those proceeds for whatever we determine at the time is the most appropriate use of proceeds, certainly redeploying the capital either to fund our development expansion pipeline or essentially pre-fund it is something that is always value accretive and always makes sense, but we also mentioned in previous calls that, particularly at today's share prices, that the idea of using proceeds from the sale of assets at what we deem to be fair value through joint ventures and using those proceeds to repurchase shares at prices that we think at a substantial discounts to the fair value of the company makes all the sense of the world. And as we get more clarity on the disposition and the joint venture program, we'll be announcing the size and all of the pricing as well as these proceeds, and you can expect that'll happen over the next 60 days."

I mean, as it relates to the margin, I mean, the things that hit very quickly were some of the expense efficiencies that Art mentioned that we picked up and could be implemented very, very quickly. The revenue side of the improvement takes a little bit longer and has to go through generate the leasing process, which takes a bit of time. So I think the second half may not be as quick as the first half in terms of picking up the improvement. When we set out to improve the margins, Art indicated that over the next 2 years, we'd probably see 400 basis points of improvement. And to date through the second quarter, we're closer to 260 or 270 basis points through 2 quarters. So the expense side came on quicker. I would expect the balance of that to move a little bit slower. Second half of the year, we do have a little bit more variability in things like percentage rents and things like that, which are somewhat an estimate and tend to be more back-end weighted. We have seen a little bit higher-than-average bad debt expense this year as a result of many of the bankruptcies that Bob mentioned in his comments. So there is a little bit of that, and that creates a little bit of uncertainty in the second half as well. We expect it to be obviously very good second half. We're guiding to same-center range of 5.5 to 6, and that's up fairly significantly from our initial guidance for the year, which is 4.25 to 4.75. That's 150 basis point pick up. I'd say as we sit here today, the bias is probably to the high side of that range we just gave but obviously, less than the second quarter."

We don't really believe in the idea of arming money to buy back stock. So once the joint ventures are committed and allocated and legally under contract, that would be the time that I -- we would anticipate that if there's going to be any stock buyback, which I think there's a strong probability that that's going to be -- make a lot of sense to us, that would be the time that we would think about such a thing. We're looking at a range of different joint ventures. But the idea that we would generate at least $1.5 billion, maybe even $2 billion of new cash from the joint venture activities is -- that could be used for whatever we deem at that point in time to be the most rational use of proceeds is certainly not out of the question. So it's a meaningful asset monetization, a very meaningful validation of our view on the value of our assets. Again, it's a very a broad cross-section of assets, and we're not legally committed to the joint ventures at this point in time. So it wouldn't be appropriate, in our mind, to address or to consider implementing a stock buyback until we have the certainty of legal commitments from the investors."

And even with these joint ventures, for example, coming you're still not getting a true sense of the value.

So it really doesn't give you any guidance to the value of the company if we sold all 10 of them. And given that our portfolio transformation is really already complete with 95% of our NOI coming from fortress assets, there's no compelling reason to do it better either.

You still have the problem that you don't have a lot of transaction in the space because these assets are so dear, and so I empathize with those that struggle with trying to come up with NAVs, and we're going to try and help you to rethink your view on NAVs by showing you some transactions that involve a substantial pool of assets that are a broad cross-section that are at substantially lower cap rates than what you all are using to get to your collective consensus of $78, and that's the best I can do, and that comes from meeting with our shareholders, okay? So in meeting with our shareholders, we asked them in terms of our strategy going forward, and there was clearly a view that this strategy is something that made sense, and that actually transacting on some joint -- some dispositions or joint ventures was more meaningful that even, for example, posting a third-party's opinion of NAV of the company, which people could believe or not believe. But real transactions speak for themselves, and so this really comes from an outreach program to shareholders that control well over 90% of our company. And it was consensus view that, that was something that our shareholders wanted to see, and in some cases, it was instigated by them. In other cases, they concurred with the idea."

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me, John Perry, Jean Wood or Art. 
It was another very strong quarter for us. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results from all the major portfolio transformation we have done over the past 2 years. This includes the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that capital to the more productive, faster-growing assets. 
Leasing spreads were good again this quarter, and we saw a strong deal volume, 335,000 square feet of shop spaces and the average positive re-leasing spread compared to the expiring rent was 17.5%. 
Mall occupancy was again very high at 95.5%, up 10 basis points from a year ago as well as up 10 basis points sequentially from last quarter. Temporary occupancy remained relatively flat at 5.3%, up slightly from 5.2% at June 30 of '14. 
In light of the very significant retail bankruptcies in the second half of last year and early '15, these are very good occupancy results. Average mall store-based rents increased to $53.62. That was up 9% from a year ago. 
Looking at FFO. For the quarter, we reported this morning FFO at $0.89 per share, that compared to $0.86 in the second quarter of 2014. Reflected in FFO was a $1.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as a $11.4 million of expense related to an unsolicited takeover attempt and contested proxy. Together they make up $0.08 a share. 
Excluding those 2 items, FFO was $0.97 per share for the quarter, ahead of both our guidance range and consensus estimates. Same-center NOI during the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the second quarter of last year, and year-to-date same-center NOI growth is up 6.29%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and an aggressive operating cost management program put into place this year. 
The results through midyear have led us to increase our same-center guidance range assumptions, up 100 basis points to 5.5% to 6% for the full year. As a result of the increase in same-center NOI, we saw a nice lift in the gross operating margin. Our gross margin increased to 69.8%, up from 67% in the second quarter of 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was $2 million, slightly higher than last year in the second quarter where we incurred $1.7 million of bad debt expense. 
During the quarter, the average interest rate was down to 3.47% compared to 4.11% a year ago. And if you look at the other balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap at quarter end was 36.9%. We had a very healthy interest coverage ratio of 3.7x. Debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis is 7.2x and average debt maturity of 5.5 years. And the financing market continues to be strong and we'll continue to be in that market. We have a number of high quality assets that have been unencumbered recently and are candidates for long-term fixed-rate financing. They include Fresno Fashion Fair, South Plains Mall, Inland Center as well as 29th Street in Boulder. 
In today's press release, we -- as a result of the strong first half results and outlook for the balance of the year, we bumped and narrowed our FFO guidance range. We increased to $3.86 to $3.94, and that's up from the prior guidance of $3.83 to $3.93 per share. 
Bringing at tenant sales, a good quarter there as well. The portfolio mall tenant sales per foot were up 10% to $623 a foot for the year ended June 30, 2015, that compared to $567 for the year ended June 30, 2014. 
On a same-center basis, sales per foot were $619 and that compared -- up 6.5% to $581 at June 30, 2014. Again, during the period, Arizona and California were top regions for us in terms of sales growth. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment."

Leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months were up 17.5%, occupancy rose by 10 basis points to 95.5%, sales reached $623 a foot. 
Bankruptcies moderated significantly from the previous quarter, and our signed leases for tenants over 10,000 square feet were strong, with over 450,000 square feet signed during the quarter, including 3 locations with H&M. 
Demand from retailers for the company's mall locations and outlet venues continues to be positive. We see retailers seeking to tie in multi-channel retail opportunities and further establish their brand identity. In addition, we see emerging brands and foreign retailers entering the U.S. through store locations, which are typically on the East and West Coast, and that aligns with our portfolio. 
Tenant bankruptcies during the first quarter provided significant headwinds with 8 national retailers declaring bankruptcy. These tenants affected 76 stores containing approximately 247,000 square feet, which generated sales of only $241 per square foot. Included were larger chains such as Radio Shack, Wet Seal and Cache. Some of this impact has been mitigated with approximately 46% of the space either leased or approved and in lease documentation. 
We have seen and expect to continue to see some retailers with large store fleets reduce their store count. This is illustrated by Gap's recent announcement to close 175 stores. Most of these store closures are effectuated through natural lease expirations as opposed to lease buyouts. We continue to believe the quality of the company's portfolio reduces the impact from both bankruptcies and store closures, which we believe will be felt disproportionally in the lower-quality centers. 
Leasing progress continues to be made at Broadway Plaza located in Walnut Creek, California. The initial portion of the first phase will open this November with 22 spaces containing 45,000 square feet. We currently have leases executed for 20 of the spaces or 91%. The remaining 2 spaces we expect to sign leases shortly. 
Some of the tenants will be part of the initial phase and new to the center include lululemon, Kidmates, Michael Kors, Madewell, Kiehl's, Lou & Grey, Athleta and Vince Camuto. The balance of the first phase will open in May '16 and contain approximately 150,000 square feet. We expect to make a more detailed announcement on the tenancy later this year. 
Significant resources are also being applied to improving the quality and revenue generation from the common areas of the shopping center. Sources of revenues include permitting kiosks and seasonal carts as well as advertising and sponsorships. As the portfolio has migrated to fewer but more dominant centers, these opportunities will grow and will result in improved operating margins. 
Through the second quarter, the number of deals approved has doubled as compared to the previous year. The majority of this impact will be felt in 2016 when the leases annualize. 
An example of this has been the conversion from stationary guest service kiosks into mobile concierges, including text responses to customers' inquiries. This has not only improved the customer service -- the customer experience, but has also allowed us to convert the former guest kiosks, which are often the best locations within the shopping center, into rent-paying retailers. 
Another example of this is at Santa Monica Place, where the new ArcLight Theatre will present significant advertising opportunities for major motion picture releases. 
Lastly, to comment on sales, year-to-date sales through the second quarter have reached $623 per square foot. The increase is attributed to a couple of factors, including the improvement in many of the key tenant sales, including people like Sephora, American Eagle, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret; secondly, through the impact of high-volume retailers like Apple and Tesla; third, the closure of low-volume stores such as Radio Shack, Wet Seal and Cache; and finally, the disposition of lower productivity centers. 
In summary, we believe our portfolio offers retailers with key locations in major markets that serve dense trade areas. These opportunities will increase in importance to omni-channel retailers that have either existing store fleets or attempting to build store bases. 
And with that, I would turn it over to Art."

We're very pleased with our operating results and with all of our metrics' that we have put up here for the first 6 months. And as you can see by our guidance adjustment, we're very bullish about our future mid-term as well as longer-term outlook. 
Same-center NOI is significantly above the guidance, even the high end of the guidance range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and one might ask what is the new normal? As I look at it, Tom mentioned that he sees total same-center NOI of around 6% on the portfolio this year, and we're not in a position yet to give guidance for 2016 and '17, but we internally are expecting to see same-center NOI growth in that same range of 6% over the next couple of years also. 
And that's largely been put into place as a consequence of re-leasing activity, a consequence of the margin improvement, some of which are yet to come, particularly on the revenue side, but we're very, very bullish on our ability to improve our margins. 
It was asked by one analyst, ""Well, have you really changed your business practices on the expense side to increase your margins."" And the answer is, is really no. We were fortunate enough this year to have a couple of major portfolio contracts for maintenance, security, for example, come up for renewal. And given the strength of our portfolio and the quality of the assets and the size of the assets, we were able to negotiate significant reductions there as well as in other areas. 
So we're very pleased about all of our operating metrics and the performance of the company and the outlook for the future on the leasing side. 
On the development side, Bob and Tom both touched on a couple of projects that are very meaningful to us, very happy with where we are on Broadway Plaza. At Tysons Corner, you are invited to a tour that's coming up here in the near future. 
The residential tower is now taking move-ins. It is currently well leased above schedule. It's currently 33% leased, and we anticipate it being fully leased by this time next year. 
As we look at other major projects that are underway, Scottsdale Fashion Square, the Dick's Sporting Goods anchor recently opened, doing very well. Harkins opens up later this year. The same combination of additional anchors are going to be opening up later this year at Cerritos and early next year at Cerritos. 
Very pleased with the impact that the announcement in the construction and the reality of the ArcLight Cinema has had on the third level of Santa Monica Place, which has actually also helped us to land a signature restaurant that will be coming to the third level of Santa Monica Place, and we expect it'll generate a tremendous amount of traffic. 
At Green Acres, the leasing on Green Acres commons, the contiguous space that we are building on the land that we acquired there is coming along extremely well. Pre-leasing activity, both at Fashion Outlets of -- in Philadelphia at The Gallery at Market East, coming along well as is San Francisco. 
The last earnings call, we were on the heels of just announcing our joint venture with Sears on 9 assets. We have been meeting with Sears and Seritage people. We're very pleased to have the opportunity to redevelop it and reposition those 9 assets, and we anticipate over the next 60 to 90 days that we'll be in a position to make more concrete announcements about what's happening within the Sears portfolio with us and the rationalization, but very happy with where we sit there. And in particular, we could be seeing some pretty significant reconfigurations and remerchandising and developments available to us at Cerritos and Washington Square, in particular, both great centers, and centers where we have the ability to recapture over 200,000 square feet from Sears, and each of them, Sears controls a 20-acre parcel of land that we're looking at various ideas for various expansions. So very bullish on where we are, pleased with our results year-to-date. 
And at this point, we'd like to open it up for Q&A."

I anticipate that over the next 30 to 60 days, we'll be in a position to provide more color on that. It'll predominantly take the form of some new joint ventures on existing assets, and the profile of the assets that are being looked at is really a very broad cross-section of the company that if you take, for example, one metric, which would be sales per foot, are virtually identical to the overall performance of the company as a whole. So the pool of assets that we're looking at include one asset that's in our top 10, 2 assets that are in our group of 11 through 20, a couple of assets that are in a group of 21 through 30 as well as a couple of assets that are in our group of 31 to 40. So it's a broad cross-section. We are in, let's say, the sixth or seventh inning of conversations. We're very gratified that the initial value indications that these institutional investors, who would be taking minority noncontrol positions, not only validate the board's opinion of value of the company that they reach with the assistance of its advisers back in March, but actually exceed those numbers. And we're looking forward to being able to announce the results of that asset and that monetization activity over the next 30 to 60 days. As we mentioned in previous calls, we will use those proceeds for whatever we determine at the time is the most appropriate use of proceeds, certainly redeploying the capital either to fund our development expansion pipeline or essentially pre-fund it if something that is always value accretive and always makes sense, but we also mentioned in previous calls that, particularly at today's share prices, that the idea of using proceeds from the sale of assets at what we deem to be fair value through joint ventures and using those proceeds to repurchase shares at prices that we think at a substantial discounts to the fair value of the company makes all the sense in the world. And as we get more clarity on the disposition and the joint venture program, we'll be announcing the size and all of the pricing as well as these proceeds, and you can expect that will  happen over the next 60 days."

I mean, as it relates to the margin -- I mean, the things that hit very quickly were some of the expense efficiencies that Art mentioned that we picked up and could be implemented very, very quickly. The revenue side of the improvement takes a little bit longer and has to go through -- generate the leasing process, which takes a little bit of time. So I think the second half may not be as quick as the first half in terms of picking up the improvement. When we set out to improve the margins, Art indicated that over the next 2 years, we'd probably see 400 basis points of improvement. And to date through the second quarter, we're closer to 260 or 270 basis points through 2 quarters. So the expense side came on quicker. I would expect the balance of that to move a little bit slower. Second half of the year, we do have a little bit more variability in things like percentage rents and things like that, which are somewhat an estimate and tend to be more back-end weighted. We have seen a little bit higher-than-average bad debt expense this year as a result of many of the bankruptcies that Bob mentioned in his comments. So there is a little bit of that, and that creates a little bit of uncertainty in the second half as well. We expect it to be obviously a good second half. We're guiding to same-center range of 5.5% to 6%, and that's up fairly significantly from our initial guidance for the year, which was 4.25% to 4.75%. That's 150 basis point pick up. I'd say as we sit here today, the bias is probably to the high side of that range we just gave, but obviously less than the second quarter."

So once the joint ventures are committed and allocated and legally under contract, that would be the time that I -- we would anticipate that if there's going to be any stock buyback, which I think there's a strong probability that that's going to be -- make a lot of sense to us. That would be the time that we would think about such a thing. We're looking at a range of different joint ventures, but the idea that we would generate at least $1.5 billion, maybe even $2 billion of new cash from the joint venture activities is -- that could be used for whatever we deem at that point in time to be the most rational use of proceeds is certainly not out of the question. So it's a meaningful asset monetization, a very meaningful validation of our view on the value of our assets. Again, it's a very broad cross-section of assets, and we're not legally committed to the joint ventures at this point in time.

And our shareholder base really communicated to us that the only way that they felt that we were going to -- that they were going to be able to update their thinking to be more in line with our thinking in terms of the NAV of the company was to monetize some assets. If there were not such a large discrepancy between what we perceive the value of the company to be and where it is currently trading, our appetite to pursue those monetizations would be diminished a little bit. But given the current very large discrepancy between where we -- our stock is trading and where we see the value of our company. And in response to really a question from our shareholders that the -- of kind of show me the money request, that's why we have pursued the monetizations, and we think we have very, very attractive use of proceeds. So we're not doing it for optics only, we just think it makes all the sense in the world, and we're clearly not taking the cream of the crop and using that to then average down in terms of the quality of the company. Thinking a very broad cross-section of quality that's representative of the company overall, and we're convinced that when we announced that deal, when we announced the valuation incentive to that deal, it'll get people a lot more visibility and confidence into our view of the value of our assets and help them to update their own thinking.

And even with these joint ventures, for example, you're still not getting a true sense of the value, it's still less than the true value because it's a minority position that has no control. And the control position or 100% position of a great mall would always trade for more than what a minority position would trade for."

You still have the problem that you don't have a lot of transaction in the space because these assets are so dear, and so I empathize with those that struggle with trying to come up with NAVs, and we're going to try and help you to rethink your view on NAVs by showing you some transactions that involve a substantial pool of assets that are a broad cross-section that are at substantially lower cap rates than what you all are using to get to your collective consensus of $78, and that's the best I can do.

So in meeting with our shareholders, we ask them in terms of our strategy going forward, and there was clearly a view that this strategy is something that made sense, and that actually transacting on some joint -- some dispositions or joint ventures was more meaningful than even, for example, posting a third-party's opinion of NAV of the company, which people could believe or not believe. But real transactions speak for themselves and -- so this really comes from an outreach program to shareholders that control well over 90% of our company.

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me, John Perry, Jean Wood or Art. 
It was another very strong quarter for us. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results from all the major portfolio transformation we have done over the past 2 years. This includes the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that capital to the more productive, faster-growing assets. 
Leasing spreads were good again this quarter, and we saw a strong deal volume, 335,000 square feet of shop spaces and the average positive re-leasing spread compared to the expiring rent was 17.5%. 
Mall occupancy was again very high at 95.5%, up 10 basis points from a year ago as well as up 10 basis points sequentially from last quarter. Temporary occupancy remained relatively flat at 5.3%, up slightly from 5.2% at June 30 of '14. 
In light of the very significant retail bankruptcies in the second half of last year and early '15, these are very good occupancy results. Average mall store-- base rents increased to $53.62. That was up 9% from a year ago. 
Looking at FFO. For the quarter, we reported this morning FFO at $0.89 per share, that compared to $0.86 in the second quarter of 2014. Reflected in FFO was a $1.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as a $11.4 million of expense related to an unsolicited takeover attempt and contested proxy. Together they make up $0.08 a share. 
Excluding those 2 items, FFO was $0.97 per share for the quarter, ahead of both our guidance range and consensus estimates. Same-center NOI during the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the second quarter of last year, and year-to-date same-center NOI growth is up 6.29%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and an aggressive operating cost management program put into place this year. 
The results through midyear have led us to increase our same-center guidance range assumptions, up 100 basis points to 5.5% to 6% for the full year. As a result of the increase in same-center NOI, we saw a nice lift in the gross operating margin. Our gross margin increased to 69.8%, up from 67% in the second quarter of 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was $2 million, slightly higher than last year in the second quarter where we incurred $1.7 million of bad debt expense. 
During the quarter, the average interest rate was down to 3.47% compared to 4.11% a year ago. And if you look at the other balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap at quarter end was 36.9%. We had a very healthy interest coverage ratio of 3.7x. Debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis is 7.2x and average debt maturity of 5.5 years. And the financing market continues to be strong and we'll continue to be in that market. We have a number of high quality assets that have been unencumbered recently and are candidates for long-term fixed-rate financing. They include Fresno Fashion Fair, South Plains Mall, Inland Center as well as 29th Street in Boulder. 
In today's press release, we -- as a result of the strong first half results and outlook for the balance of the year, we bumped and narrowed our FFO guidance range. We increased to $3.86 to $3.94, and that's up from the prior guidance of $3.83 to $3.93 per share. 
Bringing in tenant sales, a good quarter there as well. The portfolio mall tenant sales per foot were up 10% to $623 a foot for the year ended June 30, 2015, that compared to $567 for the year ended June 30, 2014. 
On a same-center basis, sales per foot were $619 and that compared -- up 6.5% to $581 at June 30, 2014. Again, during the period, Arizona and California were top regions for us in terms of sales growth. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment."

Leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months were up 17.5%, occupancy rose by 10 basis points to 95.5%, sales reached $623 a foot. 
Bankruptcies moderated significantly from the previous quarter, and our signed leases for tenants over 10,000 square feet were strong, with over 450,000 square feet signed during the quarter, including 3 locations with H&M. 
Demand from retailers for the company's mall locations and outlet venues continues to be positive. We see retailers seeking to tie in multi-channel retail opportunities and further establish their brand identity. In addition, we see emerging brands and foreign retailers entering the U.S. through store locations, which are typically on the East and West Coast, and that aligns with our portfolio. 
Tenant bankruptcies during the first quarter provided significant headwinds with 8 national retailers declaring bankruptcy. These tenants affected 76 stores containing approximately 247,000 square feet, which generated sales of only $241 per square foot. Included were larger chains such as Radio Shack, Wet Seal and Cache. Some of this impact has been mitigated with approximately 46% of the space either leased or approved and in lease documentation. 
We have seen and expect to continue to see some retailers with large store fleets reduce their store count. This is illustrated by Gap's recent announcement to close 175 stores. Most of these store closures are effectuated through natural lease expirations as opposed to lease buyouts. We continue to believe the quality of the company's portfolio reduces the impact from both bankruptcies and store closures, which we believe will be felt disproportionally in the lower-quality centers. 
Leasing progress continues to be made at Broadway Plaza located in Walnut Creek, California. The initial portion of the first phase will open this November with 22 spaces containing 45,000 square feet. We currently have leases executed for 20 of the spaces or 91%. The remaining 2 spaces we expect to sign leases shortly. 
Some of the tenants will be part of the initial phase and new to the center include lululemon, Kidmates, Michael Kors, Madewell, Kiehl's, Lou & Grey, Athleta and Vince Camuto. The balance of the first phase will open in May '16 and contain approximately 150,000 square feet. We expect to make a more detailed announcement on the tenancy later this year. 
Significant resources are also being applied to improving the quality and revenue generation from the common areas of the shopping center. Sources of revenues include permitting kiosks and seasonal carts as well as advertising and sponsorships. As the portfolio has migrated to fewer but more dominant centers, these opportunities will grow and will result in improved operating margins. 
Through the second quarter, the number of deals approved has doubled as compared to the previous year. The majority of this impact will be felt in 2016 when the leases annualize. 
An example of this has been the conversion from stationary guest service kiosks into mobile concierges, including text responses to customers' inquiries. This has not only improved the customer service -- the customer experience, but has also allowed us to convert the former guest kiosks, which are often the best locations within the shopping center, into rent-paying retailers. 
Another example of this is at Santa Monica Place, where the new ArcLight Theatre will present significant advertising opportunities for major motion picture releases. 
Lastly, to comment on sales, year-to-date sales through the second quarter have reached $623 per square foot. The increase is attributed to a couple of factors, including the improvement in many of the key tenant sales, including people like Sephora, American Eagle, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret; secondly, through the impact of high-volume retailers like Apple and Tesla; third, the closure of low-volume stores such as Radio Shack, Wet Seal and Cache; and finally, the disposition of lower productivity centers. 
In summary, we believe our portfolio offers retailers with key locations in major markets that serve dense trade areas. These opportunities will increase in importance to omni-channel retailers that have either existing store fleets or are attempting to build store bases. 
And with that, I would turn it over to Art."

We're very pleased with our operating results and with all of our metrics' that we have put up here for the first 6 months. And as you can see by our guidance adjustment, we're very bullish about our future mid-term as well as longer-term outlook. 
Same-center NOI is significantly above the guidance, even the high end of the guidance range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and one might ask what is the new normal? As I look at it, Tom mentioned that he sees total same-center NOI of around 6% on the portfolio this year, and we're not in a position yet to give guidance for 2016 and '17, but we internally are expecting to see same-center NOI growth in that same range of 6% over the next couple of years also. 
And that's largely been put into place as a consequence of re-leasing activity, a consequence of the margin improvement, some of which are yet to come, particularly on the revenue side, but we're very, very bullish on our ability to improve our margins. 
It was asked by one analyst, ""Well, have you really changed your business practices on the expense side to increase your margins."" And the answer is, is really no. We were fortunate enough this year to have a couple of major portfolio contracts for maintenance, security, for example, come up for renewal. And given the strength of our portfolio and the quality of the assets and the size of the assets, we were able to negotiate significant reductions there as well as in other areas. 
So we're very pleased about all of our operating metrics and the performance of the company and the outlook for the future on the leasing side. 
On the development side, Bob and Tom both touched on a couple of projects that are very meaningful to us, very happy with where we are on Broadway Plaza. At Tysons Corner, you are invited to a tour that's coming up here in the near future. 
The residential tower is now taking move-ins. It is currently well leased above schedule. It's currently 33% leased, and we anticipate it being fully leased by this time next year. 
As we look at other major projects that are underway, Scottsdale Fashion Square, the Dick's Sporting Goods anchor recently opened, doing very well. Harkins opens up later this year. The same combination of additional anchors are going to be opening up later this year at Cerritos and early next year at Cerritos. 
Very pleased with the impact that the announcement in the construction and the reality of the ArcLight Cinema has had on the third level of Santa Monica Place, which has actually also helped us to land a signature restaurant that will be coming to the third level of Santa Monica Place, and we expect it'll generate a tremendous amount of traffic. 
At Green Acres, the leasing on Green Acres Commons, the contiguous space that we are building on the land that we acquired there is coming along extremely well. Pre-leasing activity, both at Fashion Outlets of -- in Philadelphia at The Gallery at Market East, coming along well as is San Francisco. 
The last earnings call, we were on the heels of just announcing our joint venture with Sears on 9 assets. We have been meeting with Sears and Seritage people. We're very pleased to have the opportunity to redevelop it and reposition those 9 assets, and we anticipate over the next 60 to 90 days that we'll be in a position to make more concrete announcements about what's happening within the Sears portfolio with us and the rationalization, but very happy with where we sit there. And in particular, we could be seeing some pretty significant reconfigurations and remerchandising and developments available to us at Cerritos and Washington Square, in particular, both great centers, and centers where we have the ability to recapture over 200,000 square feet from Sears, and each of them, Sears controls a 20-acre parcel of land that we're looking at various ideas for various expansions. So very bullish on where we are, pleased with our results year-to-date. 
And at this point, we'd like to open it up for Q&A."

I anticipate that over the next 30 to 60 days, we'll be in a position to provide more color on that. It'll predominantly take the form of some new joint ventures on existing assets, and the profile of the assets that are being looked at is really a very broad cross-section of the company that if you take, for example, one metric, which would be sales per foot, are virtually identical to the overall performance of the company as a whole. So the pool of assets that we're looking at include one asset that's in our top 10, 2 assets that are in our group of 11 through 20, a couple of assets that are in a group of 21 through 30 as well as a couple of assets that are in our group of 31 to 40. So it's a broad cross section. We are in, let's say, the sixth or seventh inning of conversations. We're very gratified that the initial value indications that these institutional investors, who would be taking minority noncontrol positions, not only validate the board's opinion of value of the company that they reached with the assistance of its advisers back in March, but actually exceed those numbers. And we're looking forward to being able to announce the results of that asset net monetization activity over the next 30 to 60 days. As we mentioned in previous calls, we will use those proceeds for whatever we determine at the time is the most appropriate use of proceeds, certainly redeploying the capital either to fund our development expansion pipeline or essentially pre-fund it if something that is always value accretive and always makes sense, but we also mentioned in previous calls that, particularly at today's share prices, that the idea of using proceeds from the sale of assets at what we deem to be fair value through joint ventures and using those proceeds to repurchase shares at prices that we think at a substantial discounts to the fair value of the company makes all the sense in the world. And as we get more clarity on the disposition and the joint venture program, we'll be announcing the size and all of the pricing as well as these proceeds, and you can expect that will  happen over the next 60 days."

I mean, as it relates to the margin -- I mean, the things that hit very quickly were some of the expense efficiencies that Art mentioned that we picked up and could be implemented very, very quickly. The revenue side of the improvement takes a little bit longer and has to go through -- generate the leasing process, which takes a little bit of time. So I think the second half may not be as quick as the first half in terms of picking up the improvement. When we set out to improve the margins, Art indicated that over the next 2 years, we'd probably see 400 basis points of improvement. And to date through the second quarter, we're closer to 260 or 270 basis points through 2 quarters. So the expense side came on quicker. I would expect the balance of that to move a little bit slower. Second half of the year, we do have a little bit more variability in things like percentage rents and things like that, which are somewhat an estimate and tend to be more back-end weighted. We have seen a little bit higher-than-average bad debt expense this year as a result of many of the bankruptcies that Bob mentioned in his comments. So there is a little bit of that, and that creates a little bit of uncertainty in the second half as well. We expect it to be obviously a good second half. We're guiding to same-center range of 5.5% to 6%, and that's up fairly significantly from our initial guidance for the year, which was 4.25% to 4.75%. That's 150 basis point pick up. I'd say as we sit here today, the bias is probably to the high side of that range we just gave, but obviously less than the second quarter."

That would be the time that we would think about such a thing.

I made a comment earlier in my comments that we currently have 4 pretty significant unencumbered assets: Fresno Fashion Fair, South Plains, Inland, 29th Street, for example, and there's others, but those alone are $800 million of refinancing proceeds at a comfortable 50% or so LTV. And the anticipation is that we will gradually, as market conditions allow, finance those and that capital can be used to pay down the line of credit. We really don't have a lot of floating rate debt on the books, so we haven't been in a huge hurry, but debt financing out there. And Fresno, we've been in the market getting bids and the others would finance out pretty quickly, particularly in the CMBS market. So that's the plan there, at least at the moment."

Dispositions by their very nature, I'm just an agnostic, and I believe them when they close. And otherwise, I just don't even try and predict. So we really decided that while that is a source of capital for us, it really only represents 5% or 6% of our NOI. So it really doesn't give you any guidance to the value of the company if we sold all 10 of them. And given that our portfolio transformation is really already complete with 95% of our NOI coming from fortress assets, there's no compelling reason to do it there either. The whole idea of the reverse leverage where some of your weaker centers hurt your better centers is behind us now, and our better centers are no longer being homogenized down, which can tend to happen, and that's one of the reasons that you continue to see these double-digit re-leasing spreads that Bob and we have been reporting to you.

As to -- if we believe that our NAV was $78 a share, this company would no longer be in existence. It would have been sold. We clearly don't believe that.

You still have the problem that you don't have a lot of transactions in the space because these assets are so dear, and so I empathize with those that struggle with trying to come up with NAVs, and we're going to try and help you to rethink your view on NAVs by showing you some transactions that involve a substantial pool of assets that are a broad cross-section that are at substantially lower cap rates than what you all are using to get to your collective consensus of $78, and that's the best I can do. And that comes from meeting with our shareholders, okay? So in meeting with our shareholders, we ask them in terms of our strategy going forward, and there was clearly a view that this strategy is something that made sense, and that actually transacting on some joint -- some dispositions or joint ventures was more meaningful than even, for example, posting a third-party's opinion of NAV of the company, which people could believe or not believe. But real transactions speak for themselves and -- so this really comes from an outreach program to shareholders that control well over 90% of our company. And it was a consensus view that, that was something that our shareholders wanted to see, and in some cases, it was instigated by them. In other cases, they concurred with the idea."

If anyone at that time still has questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or John Perry or Jean Wood.
It was another very strong quarter for us. We continue to see the benefit in our operating results of the major portfolio transformation we've been through the past 3 years, including the sale of 15 low-productivity malls and the redeployment of that capital to more productive, faster-growing assets. Leasing spreads were good again this quarter, and we saw a good deal volume. Bob Perlmutter will be speaking in more detail on leasing environment in a moment. We signed about 265,000 square feet of leases on space under 10,000 square feet, with average re-leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months of 16.3%. That's on a cash basis.
Mall occupancy was at 95.4%, down slightly from a year ago. But If you look at a permanent occupancy was actually up 30 basis points to 90.2%. Average malls base rents increased to 53.83%, up from 49.27% a year ago.
In terms of FFO, FFO for the quarter came in at $1.01. That compared to $0.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Same-center NOI for the quarter was up 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. And year-to-date same-center NOI is up 6.5%. The increase has been driven by increased permanent occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management.
Likewise, our gross operating margins also improved significantly. Gross margin came in at 69.5%. That's up from 66.4% in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, the gross margin has improved by 260 -- excuse me, 250 basis points to 68.6% compared to 66.1% through the first 9 months of 2014.
Bad debt expense for the quarter was about $800,000. That compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Lease termination revenue was up modestly at $3.4 million in the quarter, up from $2.2 million in the third quarter of last year. And I should note, in the fourth quarter '15, we forecasted on $1 million to $2 million [ph] of lease term revenue which will comp negatively compared to the $6.8 million that we had in the fourth quarter of '14. So that will have an adverse impact obviously on the fourth quarter same-center NOI growth rate. We still expect to see fourth quarter NOI growth rate of 4.5% to 5%, however, even factoring in the expected drop in lease term revenue.
Looking at the balance sheet. It continues to be in great shape. Debt-to-market cap at quarter end was 36.5%. [ph] Interest coverage, 3.9x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.5 years. Although with the refinancings we have underway, that will stretch to 6.5 year maturity -- average maturity. The financing market continues to be strong. Concurrent with the joint ventures I'll be discussing a moment, we're doing $1.8 billion in new financing and have a yield over $1.1 million of excess proceeds to MAC, that includes the financing of Washington Square, $550 million of existing debt is $225 million. So we're doubling the size of that debt. We have now a lock-in rate at 3.65% for 7 years. We expect to close on that loan on Thursday -- this Thursday, tomorrow. And South Plains, we closed last Friday on a $200 million loan and 4.22%, and that's for 10 years. South Plains have been previously unencumbered. Los Cerritos Center on Friday, we expect to close $525 million worth of the new loan. That's at 4% fixed for 12 years. That pays off the existing debt of $186 million. And then in January, we expect to close on the loan on Arrowhead, which is $400 million. That rate is also locked a 4.05% for 12 years. And both Los Cerritos, Arrowhead and Washington Square are interest-only loans for the first 6 years.
As announced on September 30, we've reached agreement to contribute minority interest in 8 properties, [indiscernible] a total value of $5.4 billion, which represent a good cross-section of assets from the Macerich portfolio. [indiscernible] separate joint ventures with GIC, who owns 40% of 5 assets in Heitman [indiscernible] of 49% in 3 assets. Expected cash proceeds from the transactions total about $2.3 billion, which includes about $1.15 billion of excess refinanced proceeds, most of which I just spoke of. Use of proceeds is expected to include share repurchases under the company's recently authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program. We're also planning to pay down a line of credit, and we expect to make 2 special dividends totaling in the range of 3.5 to 4.5. We're very pleased to entering into these transactions with these very well-regarded investment partners. This is an expansion of our long-standing relationship with Heitman and the beginning of a new one with GIC. These transactions provide us with significant capital to create additional shareholder value. They also highlight the significant differential between the private and public market valuation of our assets.
The joint venture that will include Lakewood, Los Cerritos, South Plains and Washington Square, which is a total value of $3.1 billion, is expected to close within a week, possibly as early as this Friday, October 30. Arrowhead, Flat Iron, Deptford and Twenty Ninth Street are all expected to close in early January.
Cash to MAC on the first closing is $1.44 billion, which includes about $850 million of excess loan proceeds. On October 23, our Board of Directors declared a 4.4% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.68 per share of common stock. That dividend is payable December 4 to stockholders of record on close of business on November 12.
In addition, we expect that as a result of the joint ventures that we're in the process of closing, 2 special dividends of approximately $2 each per share will be paid in December and January. Action on those will take place shortly after the Q2 closings -- or at least the first closing, which we expect within a week.
In our press release this morning, we reaffirmed our previously provided FFO per share guidance range, $3.86 to $3.94. That also factors in about $0.03 a share of dilution that we expect to occur as a result of the joint ventures for the balance of this year. That's on the 4 assets closed within the next week for roughly 2 months that remain in this year.
Tenant sales, Bob will get into more detail. But just an overall basis, the portfolio tenant sales came in at $630 for the trailing 12 months. And if you look at that compared to last year, the portfolio was $571. On a same-center basis, we're up about 7.7% at $630 compared to $585 on a same-center basis at September 30, 2014. Very strong increase.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."

Performance during the third quarter remained strong as the company's portfolio continues to benefit from the aggressive capital recycling program achieved during the past 3 years. The sale of noncore slower-growing assets and the repatriation of these dollars into high-growth acquisitions, development and redevelopment initiatives is resulting in strong performance. Consistent with a strategy, we are seeing an accelerated differentiation by retailers between A quality centers and lower productivity assets.
During the third quarter, leasing spreads were 16.3% on a trailing 12-month period. Lease space dropped slightly by 10 basis points to 95.4%. On a year-over-year basis, the portfolio is down 20 basis points, which is -- which declined as modest given the magnitude of the tenant bankruptcies earlier in 2015 and we believe illustrates the high-quality portfolio that Macerich owns. We have discussed many times our goals in reducing temporary tenant occupancy. On a year-over-year basis, our temporary tenant occupancy has decreased 50 basis points, while permanent occupancy rose 30 basis points.
During the third quarter, leasing levels increased to the top 20 centers. Within our portfolio, we are experiencing the strongest leasing spreads at the East and West Coast centers. Demand from retailers larger than 10,000 square feet continues to be active with over 200,000 square feet leased during the third quarter. Some notable deals include H&M at Broadway Plaza, Nordstrom Rack at Fashion Outlets in Chicago and [indiscernible] at Tyson center.
Finally, during the quarter we converted 52,000 square feet from temporary to permanent tenants, resulting in 109% rent increase.
Sales ended the third quarter at $630 per square foot, which is another high watermark for the company. Year-over-year, sales per square foot shows 7.7% increase in the same-center basis. Positive drivers for sales per square foot include: One, the increase from high-impact tenants such as Apple and Tesla; two, strong category such as home furnishings, jewelry, athletic footwear and cosmetics; three, store closures and remerchandising of underproductive tenants such as RadioShack, Coldwater Creek, Love Culture, Gap and Wet Seal; and four, strong comparable sales in a number of centers, including Fashion Outlets of Chicago. And negative side, apparel sales are only showing modest sales per square foot gains as they struggle with a lack of a distinct fashion trend, increasing competition from large-format retailers and sluggish consumer sentiment. All regions are showing increase in sales, with the West Coast posting the highest growth levels.
Turning to the development projects. We are pleased with the progress at Broadway Plaza, where we are nearly complete with the leasing for the first phase of the densification of this unique asset. A portion of the first phase will open in November, with the majority of the expansion opening in May 2016. Earlier in the week, we issued a press release, which is available on our website, announcing 45 stores that have signed leases in this development. We are particularly pleased that Arhaus, Gap, H&M and Zara are all signed to build 2-level flagship stores at Broadway Plaza. Overall, the first phase has 84% of the space under signed leases, and we expect to add more retailers to this list prior to the May 2016 opening. We are also pleased with the leasing progress at Green Acres Commons, a 335,000-square-foot power center located adjacent to Green Acres Mall. The center has executed leases on 75% of the space and will be anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, Ashley Furniture and Burlington as well as a number of freestanding restaurants. We are planning a fourth quarter 2016 opening.
Century 21 held a very successful store opening yesterday at Green Acres Mall. We believe the addition of this unique 70,000-square-foot department store will significantly add to the market penetration of this center. We are also seeing the impact of adding theaters to some of our premier assets, including Santa Monica Place, Scottsdale Fashion Square and Los Cerritos. These theaters, which will open in the coming months, have increased demand from high-quality restaurants, fast casual food concepts and specialty stores. Restaurants opening during the fourth quarter include Cheesecake Factory at Santa Monica Place and Los Cerritos as well as Shake Shack at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Looking forward, we continue to make progress on the redevelopment of the existing Sears Store Kings Plaza as well as the pre-leasing for the outlet centers in Philadelphia and San Francisco. We expect to discuss these developments in the coming months. Art and Tom have both spoken in the past about our renewed emphasis on our common areas. We are focused on enhancing the revenue generation and elevating the customer experience, with a particular emphasis on Fortress assets for both permanent kiosks and business development opportunities.
We are forecasting by the end of the year 2015, the in-place annualized permanent kiosk revenue will have increased over 20% as compared to the previous year. Illustrative of the commitment to quality at Santa Monica Place, we have been able to attract such users as Starbucks, Aesop, which is a high-end U.K. skincare company; and Press Juice into the common areas. All of these will impact revenue and enhance our customer experience.
Looking towards end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years. Many of these retailers are public companies. And based on their current stock prices, the markets are pricing in a significant risk of bankruptcy. Contrary to the previous year, we are expecting less store closings as part of the bankruptcies as many of the retailers are prime candidates for restructuring with a smaller store base. Again, we believe the lower-quality centers will be disproportionately impacted.
In conclusion, the performance during the first 3 quarters reflects a continuing demand from retailers for locations in high-quality centers that serve dense and affluent trade area. The companies focus on better quality centers, with a significant presence on both coasts, is consistent with many retailers brick-and-mortar expansion plans. The impact of the capital recycling that has occurred during the past 3 years is very evident in the year-to-date results and we believe positions Macerich well into the coming years. Tom?"

So once that program is started, if we go that route, they could buy all the way through the quarter with no blackout windows. If it's for us, typically, once the quarter ends, we're in a blackout period until 3 days after earnings call, something like that. So about 1/3 of the quarter would be under normal circumstances would be a blackout period for us. Just depends on what method we use to proceed with the buyback."

If you take a look at the impact of the expense cuts, 7% for the quarter. Expense savings and cuts combined were about 2.4% of that. So that still puts us at 4.6% growth rate in the quarter, excluding the expenses that helped drive the number up to 7%. As I mentioned earlier in the call, fourth quarter we have expected that to be that high because we include lease termination revenues, that's cash revenue to us. It's an active part of the mall business when you make a decision to recapture space, take some cash now and create a vacancy or not. So we included in our definition of same-center NOI. And in the fourth quarter last year, we had about $6.8 million of lease termination revenue. Our projection for the fourth quarter of this year is about $1 million to $2 million. So that's about $4.8 million that's going to have an adverse affect on that same-center NOI number in the fourth quarter. So we think the fourth quarter will be more like 4.5% or so. And if you combine that with the first 3 quarters, then it average 6.5%, we end up at about 6%, which is the upper end of our guidance range."

And again, we believe our centers will line up very much with what their store expansion will be. But we are very impressed with the amount of traffic they generate, and we're obviously very impressed with their pricing, but we're also very impressed with the physical box that they build and the way that they handle the traffic through their store. We believe their stores will take volume from multiple people both inside and outside the mall, both some fast fashion specialty format retailers but also some big box and apparel retailers outside the mall. So we really, Jim, see their impact as more than just taking market share from mall tenants. We see it as impacting many different venues. I think what you'll see is, you will see the retailers adjust and become potentially even more competitive in terms of their pricing policy, and it will force the retailers to become better at providing the merchandise to the customers at a more affordable price."

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please not hesitate to reach out for me or John Perry or Jean Wood.
It was another very strong quarter for us. We continue to see the benefit in our operating results of the major portfolio transformation that we've been through the past 3 years, including the sale of 15 low-productivity malls and the redeployment of that capital into more productive, faster-growing assets. Leasing spreads were good again this quarter, and we saw good deal volume. Bob Perlmutter will be speaking in more detail on the leasing environment in a moment. 
We signed about 265,000 square feet of leases on space under 10,000 square feet with average re-leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months of 16.3%. That's on a cash basis. Mall occupancy was at 95.4%, down slightly from a year ago. But if you look at the permanent occupancy per [indiscernible], occupancy was actually up 30 basis points to 90.2%. Average malls' base rents increased to 53.83%, up from 49.27% a year ago.
In terms of FFO, FFO for the quarter came in at $1.01. That compared to $0.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Same-center NOI for the quarter was up 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. And year-to-date, same-center NOI is up 6.5%. The increase has been driven by increased permanent occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. Likewise, our gross operating margins also improved significantly. Gross margin came in at 69.5%. That's up from 66.4% in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, the gross margin has improved by 260 -- 250 basis points to 68.6% compared to 66.1% through the first 9 months of 2014.
Bad debt expense for the quarter was about $800,000. That compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Lease termination revenue was up modestly at $3.4 million in the quarter, up from $2.2 million in the third quarter of last year. And I should note, in the fourth quarter of '15, we forecast about $1 million to $2 million of lease term revenue, which will comp negatively compared to the $6.8 million that we had in the fourth quarter of '14. So that will have an adverse impact obviously on the fourth quarter same-center NOI growth rate. We still expect to see fourth quarter NOI growth rate of 4.5% to 5%, however, even factoring in the expected drop in lease term revenue.
Looking at the balance sheet. It continues to be in great shape. Debt-to-market cap at quarter end was 36.5%; interest coverage, 3.9x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.5 years. Although with the refinancings we have underway, that will stretch to 6.5 year average maturity. The financing market continues to be strong. Concurrent with the joint ventures that I'll be discussing in a moment, we're doing $1.8 billion in new financing and that will yield over $1.1 billion of excess proceeds to MAC. That includes the financing of Washington Square, $550 million. The existing debt is $225 million, so we're doubling the size of that debt. We have now a lock-in rate at 3.65% for 7 years. We expect to close on that loan on Thursday -- this Thursday, tomorrow. 
In South Plains, we closed last Friday on a $200 million loan at 4.22% and that's for 10 years. South Plains had been previously unencumbered. Los Cerritos Center on Friday, we expect to close $525 million worth of a new loan. That's at 4% fixed for 12 years. That pays off the existing debt of $186 million. And then in January, we expect to close on the loan on Arrowhead, which is $400 million. That rate is also locked at 4.05% for 12 years. And both Los Cerritos, Arrowhead and Washington Square are interest-only loans for the first 6 years.
As announced on September 30, we've reached agreement to contribute minority interest in 8 properties valued at a total value of $5.4 billion, which represented a good cross-section of assets from the Macerich portfolio. They went into separate joint ventures with GIC, who owns 40% of 5 assets in Heitman that will own 49% in 3 assets. Expected cash proceeds from the transactions total about $2.3 billion, which includes about $1.15 billion of excess refinanced proceeds, most of which I just spoke of. Use of proceeds is expected to include share repurchases under the company's recently authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program. We're also planning to pay down the line of credit. And we expect to make 2 special dividends that total in the range of $3.50 to $4.50. 
We're very pleased to enter into these transactions with these very well-regarded investment partners. This is an expansion of our long-standing relationship with Heitman and the beginning of a new one with GIC. These transactions provide us with significant capital to create additional shareholder value. They also highlight the significant differential between the private and public market valuation of our assets. The joint venture that will include Lakewood, Los Cerritos, South Plains and Washington Square, which has a total value of $3.1 billion, is expected to close within a week, possibly as early as this Friday, October 30. Arrowhead, FlatIron, Deptford and Twenty Ninth Street are all expected to close in early January. Cash to MAC on the first closing is $1.44 billion, which includes about $850 million of excess loan proceeds. 
On October 23, our Board of Directors declared a 4.4% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.68 per share of common stock. That dividend is payable December 4 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 12. In addition, we expect that as a result of the joint ventures that we're in the process of closing, 2 special dividends of approximately $2 each per share will be paid in December and January. Action on those will take place shortly after the 2 closings or at least the first closing, which we expect within a week.
In our press release this morning, we reaffirmed our previously provided FFO per share guidance range, $3.86 to $3.94. That also factors in about $0.03 a share of dilution that we expect to occur as a result of the joint ventures for the balance of this year. That's on the 4 assets that close within the next week for roughly 2 months that remain in this year.
Tenant sales, Bob will get into more detail. But just on an overall basis, the portfolio tenant sales came in at $630 for the trailing 12 months. And if you look at that compared to last year, the portfolio was $571. On a same-center basis, we're up about 7.7% at $630 compared to $585 on a same-center basis at September 30, 2014, very strong increase.
And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."
332172,310977878,884197,"The Macerich Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Macerich Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Performance during the third quarter remained strong as the company's portfolio continues to benefit from the aggressive capital recycling program achieved during the past 3 years. The sale of noncore, slower-growing assets and the repatriati",1024,"Thanks, Tom. Performance during the third quarter remained strong as the company's portfolio continues to benefit from the aggressive capital recycling program achieved during the past 3 years. The sale of noncore, slower-growing assets and the repatriation of these dollars into high-growth acquisitions, development and redevelopment initiatives is resulting in strong performance. Consistent with this strategy, we are seeing an accelerated differentiation by retailers between A quality centers and lower-productivity assets.
During the third quarter, leasing spreads were 16.3% on a trailing 12-month period. Lease space dropped slightly by 10 basis points to 95.4%. On a year-over-year basis, the portfolio is down 20 basis points, which is -- which declined as modest, given the magnitude of the tenant bankruptcies earlier in 2015 and we believe illustrates the high-quality portfolio that Macerich owns. We have discussed many times our goals in reducing temporary tenant occupancy. On a year-over-year basis, our temporary tenant occupancy has decreased 50 basis points while permanent occupancy rose 30 basis points.
During the third quarter, leasing levels increased to the top 20 centers. Within our portfolio, we are experiencing the strongest leasing spreads at the East and West Coast centers. Demand from retailers larger than 10,000 square feet continues to be active with over 200,000 square feet leased during the third quarter. Some notable deals include H&M at Broadway Plaza, Nordstrom Rack at Fashion Outlets of Chicago and UNIQLO at Tysons Center. Finally, during the quarter we converted 52,000 square feet from temporary to permanent tenants, resulting in 109% rent increase.
Sales ended the third quarter at $630 per square foot, which is another high-water mark for the company. Year-over-year, sales per square foot showed a 7.7% increase on a same-center basis. Positive drivers for sales per square foot include: one, increase from high-impact tenants, such as Apple and Tesla; two, strong categories, such as home furnishings, jewelry, athletic footwear and cosmetics; three, store closures and remerchandising of underproductive tenants, such as RadioShack, Coldwater Creek, Love Culture, Gap and Wet Seal; and four, strong comparable sales at a number of centers, including Fashion Outlets of Chicago. On the negative side, apparel sales are only showing modest sales per square foot gains as they struggle with a lack of a distinct fashion trend, increasing competition from large-format retailers and sluggish consumer sentiment. All regions are showing increase in sales with the West Coast posting the highest growth levels.
Turning to the development projects. We are pleased with the progress at Broadway Plaza, where we are nearly complete with the leasing for the first phase of the densification of this unique asset. A portion of the first phase will open in November with the majority of the expansion opening in May 2016. Earlier in the week, we issued a press release, which is available on our website, announcing 45 stores that have signed leases in this development. We are particularly pleased that Arhaus, Gap, H&M and Zara are all signed to build 2-level flagship stores at Broadway Plaza. Overall, the first phase has 84% of the space under signed leases, and we expect to add more retailers to this list prior to the May 2016 opening. 
We are also pleased with the leasing progress at Green Acres Commons, a 335,000 square foot power center located adjacent to Green Acres Mall. The center has executed leases on 75% of the space and will be anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, Ashley Furniture and Burlington as well as a number of freestanding restaurants. We are planning a fourth quarter 2016 opening. Century 21 held a very successful store opening yesterday at Green Acres Mall. We believe the addition of this unique 70,000 square foot department store will significantly add to the market penetration of this center. 
We are also seeing the impact of adding theaters to some of our premier assets, including Santa Monica Place, Scottsdale Fashion Square and Los Cerritos. These theaters, which will open in the coming months, have increased demand from high-quality restaurants, fast casual food concepts and specialty stores. Restaurants opening during the fourth quarter include Cheesecake Factory at Santa Monica Place and Los Cerritos as well as Shake Shack at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Looking forward, we continue to make progress on the redevelopment of the existing Sears store at Kings Plaza as well as the preleasing for the outlet centers in Philadelphia and San Francisco. We expect to discuss these developments in the coming months. 
Art and Tom have both spoken in the past about our renewed emphasis on our common areas. We are focused on enhancing the revenue generation and elevating the customer experience with a particular emphasis on fortress assets for both permanent kiosks and business development opportunities. We are forecasting by the end of the year 2015, the in-place annualized permanent kiosk revenue will have increased over 20% as compared to the previous year. Illustrative of the commitment to quality at Santa Monica Place, we have been able to attract such users as Starbucks; Aesop, which is a high-end U.K. skincare company; and Press Juice [ph] into the common areas. All of these will impact revenue and enhance our customer experience.
Looking towards end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years. Many of these retailers are public companies. And based on their current stock prices, the markets are pricing in a significant risk of bankruptcy. Contrary to the previous year, we are expecting less store closings as part of the bankruptcies as many of the retailers are prime candidates for restructuring with a smaller store base. Again, we believe the lower-quality centers will be disproportionately impacted.
In conclusion, the performance during the first 3 quarters reflects a continuing demand from retailers for locations in high-quality centers that serve dense and affluent trade areas. The company's focus on better-quality centers with a significant presence on both coasts is consistent with many retailers' brick-and-mortar expansion plans. The impact of the capital recycling that has occurred during the past 3 years is very evident in the year-to-date results, and we believe positions Macerich well into the coming years. Tom?"

I mean, a lot of those downsizes typically are kind of part of a Chapter 11 filing. I mean, would you contemplate chains negotiating exits outside of bankruptcy to downsize and become more profitable? And kind of how are you thinking about that?"

I think the distinction I was trying to draw is that when a tenant goes bankrupt in the last couple of years, we've seen most of them result in the entire chain being closed. A number of the candidates that we believe are potentially priced in the way that bankruptcy is a significant risk. We're not as certain that they're going to close the number of stores that the previous bankruptcies incurred. So we basically feel the bankruptcy levels may be dissimilar as last year, but the amount of store closings may be less because a number of these chains will use bankruptcy potentially to reduce their store count. Outside of bankruptcy, it's more difficult because the landlords will typically require some buyout or compensation. And many of the companies have not -- there's been very few examples where companies have been successful doing that."

And that's far more critical than occupancy with a temporary tenant. So the economic occupancy actually went up. If you take a look at the impact of the expense cuts, 7% for the quarter, the expense savings and cuts combined were about 2.4% of that. So that still puts us at 4.6% growth rate in the quarter, excluding the expenses that helped drive the number up to 7%. As I mentioned earlier in the call, fourth quarter, we don't expect to be that high because we include lease termination revenues. That's cash revenue to us. It's an active part of the mall business, whether you make the decision to recapture space, take some cash now and create a vacancy or not. So we included it in our definition of same-center NOI. And in the fourth quarter last year, we had about $6.8 million of lease termination revenue. Our projection for the fourth quarter of this year is about $1 million to $2 million. So that's about $4.8 million that's going to have an adverse affect on that same-center NOI number in the fourth quarter. So we think the fourth quarter will be more like 4.5% or so. And if you combine that with the first 3 quarters that have averaged 6.5%, we end up at about 6%, which is the upper end of our guidance range. Still very strong, I might add."

We believe their stores will take volume from multiple people both inside and outside the mall, both some fast fashion specialty format retailers but also some big box and apparel retailers outside the mall. So we really, Jim, see their impact as more than just taking market share from mall tenants. We see it as impacting many different venues.

It was another very strong quarter for us. We continue to see the benefit in our operating results of the major portfolio transformation that we've been through the past 3 years, including the sale of 15 low-productivity malls and the redeployment of that capital into more productive, faster-growing assets. Leasing spreads were good again this quarter, and we saw good deal volume. Bob Perlmutter will be speaking in more detail on the leasing environment in a moment. 
We signed about 265,000 square feet of leases on space under 10,000 square feet with average re-leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months of 16.3%. That's on a cash basis. Mall occupancy was at 95.4%, down slightly from a year ago. But if you look at the permanent occupancy per [indiscernible], occupancy was actually up 30 basis points to 90.2%. Average malls' base rents increased to 53.83%, up from 49.27% a year ago.
In terms of FFO, FFO for the quarter came in at $1.01. That compared to $0.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Same-center NOI for the quarter was up 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. And year-to-date, same-center NOI is up 6.5%. The increase has been driven by increased permanent occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. Likewise, our gross operating margins also improved significantly. Gross margin came in at 69.5%. That's up from 66.4% in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, the gross margin has improved by 260 -- 250 basis points to 68.6% compared to 66.1% through the first 9 months of 2014.
Bad debt expense for the quarter was about $800,000. That compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Lease termination revenue was up modestly at $3.4 million in the quarter, up from $2.2 million in the third quarter of last year. And I should note, in the fourth quarter of '15, we forecast about $1 million to $2 million of lease term revenue, which will comp negatively compared to the $6.8 million that we had in the fourth quarter of '14. So that will have an adverse impact obviously on the fourth quarter same-center NOI growth rate. We still expect to see fourth quarter NOI growth rate of 4.5% to 5%, however, even factoring in the expected drop in lease term revenue.
Looking at the balance sheet. It continues to be in great shape. Debt-to-market cap at quarter end was 36.5%; interest coverage, 3.9x; debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; average debt maturity, 5.5 years. Although with the refinancings we have underway, that will stretch to 6.5 year average maturity. The financing market continues to be strong. Concurrent with the joint ventures that I'll be discussing in a moment, we're doing $1.8 billion in new financing and that will yield over $1.1 billion of excess proceeds to MAC. That includes the financing of Washington Square, $550 million. The existing debt is $225 million, so we're doubling the size of that debt. We have now a lock-in rate at 3.65% for 7 years. We expect to close on that loan on Thursday -- this Thursday, tomorrow. 
In South Plains, we closed last Friday on a $200 million loan at 4.22% and that's for 10 years. South Plains had been previously unencumbered. Los Cerritos Center on Friday, we expect to close $525 million worth of a new loan. That's at 4% fixed for 12 years. That pays off the existing debt of $186 million. And then in January, we expect to close on the loan on Arrowhead, which is $400 million. That rate is also locked at 4.05% for 12 years. And both Los Cerritos, Arrowhead and Washington Square are interest-only loans for the first 6 years.
As announced on September 30, we've reached agreement to contribute minority interest in 8 properties valued at a total value of $5.4 billion, which represented a good cross-section of assets from the Macerich portfolio. They went into separate joint ventures with GIC, who owns 40% of 5 assets in Heitman that will own 49% in 3 assets. Expected cash proceeds from the transactions total about $2.3 billion, which includes about $1.15 billion of excess refinanced proceeds, most of which I just spoke of. Use of proceeds is expected to include share repurchases under the company's recently authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program. We're also planning to pay down the line of credit. And we expect to make 2 special dividends that total in the range of $3.50 to $4.50. 
We're very pleased to enter into these transactions with these very well-regarded investment partners. This is an expansion of our long-standing relationship with Heitman and the beginning of a new one with GIC. These transactions provide us with significant capital to create additional shareholder value. They also highlight the significant differential between the private and public market valuation of our assets. The joint venture that will include Lakewood, Los Cerritos, South Plains and Washington Square, which has a total value of $3.1 billion, is expected to close within a week, possibly as early as this Friday, October 30. Arrowhead, FlatIron, Deptford and Twenty Ninth Street are all expected to close in early January. Cash to MAC on the first closing is $1.44 billion, which includes about $850 million of excess loan proceeds. 
On October 23, our Board of Directors declared a 4.4% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.68 per share of common stock. That dividend is payable December 4 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 12. In addition, we expect that as a result of the joint ventures that we're in the process of closing, 2 special dividends of approximately $2 each per share will be paid in December and January. Action on those will take place shortly after the 2 closings or at least the first closing, which we expect within a week.
In our press release this morning, we reaffirmed our previously provided FFO per share guidance range, $3.86 to $3.94. That also factors in about $0.03 a share of dilution that we expect to occur as a result of the joint ventures for the balance of this year. That's on the 4 assets that close within the next week for roughly 2 months that remain in this year.
Tenant sales, Bob will get into more detail. But just on an overall basis, the portfolio tenant sales came in at $630 for the trailing 12 months. And if you look at that compared to last year, the portfolio was $571. On a same-center basis, we're up about 7.7% at $630 compared to $585 on a same-center basis at September 30, 2014, very strong increase.
And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."

Performance during the third quarter remained strong as the company's portfolio continues to benefit from the aggressive capital recycling program achieved during the past 3 years. The sale of noncore, slower-growing assets and the repatriation of these dollars into high-growth acquisitions, development and redevelopment initiatives is resulting in strong performance. Consistent with this strategy, we are seeing an accelerated differentiation by retailers between A quality centers and lower-productivity assets.
During the third quarter, leasing spreads were 16.3% on a trailing 12-month period. Lease space dropped slightly by 10 basis points to 95.4%. On a year-over-year basis, the portfolio is down 20 basis points, which is -- which declined as modest, given the magnitude of the tenant bankruptcies earlier in 2015 and we believe illustrates the high-quality portfolio that Macerich owns. We have discussed many times our goals in reducing temporary tenant occupancy. On a year-over-year basis, our temporary tenant occupancy has decreased 50 basis points while permanent occupancy rose 30 basis points.
During the third quarter, leasing levels increased to the top 20 centers. Within our portfolio, we are experiencing the strongest leasing spreads at the East and West Coast centers. Demand from retailers larger than 10,000 square feet continues to be active with over 200,000 square feet leased during the third quarter. Some notable deals include H&M at Broadway Plaza, Nordstrom Rack at Fashion Outlets of Chicago and UNIQLO at Tysons Center. Finally, during the quarter we converted 52,000 square feet from temporary to permanent tenants, resulting in 109% rent increase.
Sales ended the third quarter at $630 per square foot, which is another high-water mark for the company. Year-over-year, sales per square foot showed a 7.7% increase on a same-center basis. Positive drivers for sales per square foot include: one, increase from high-impact tenants, such as Apple and Tesla; two, strong categories, such as home furnishings, jewelry, athletic footwear and cosmetics; three, store closures and remerchandising of underproductive tenants, such as RadioShack, Coldwater Creek, Love Culture, Gap and Wet Seal; and four, strong comparable sales at a number of centers, including Fashion Outlets of Chicago. On the negative side, apparel sales are only showing modest sales per square foot gains as they struggle with a lack of a distinct fashion trend, increasing competition from large-format retailers and sluggish consumer sentiment. All regions are showing increase in sales with the West Coast posting the highest growth levels.
Turning to the development projects. We are pleased with the progress at Broadway Plaza, where we are nearly complete with the leasing for the first phase of the densification of this unique asset. A portion of the first phase will open in November with the majority of the expansion opening in May 2016. Earlier in the week, we issued a press release, which is available on our website, announcing 45 stores that have signed leases in this development. We are particularly pleased that Arhaus, Gap, H&M and Zara are all signed to build 2-level flagship stores at Broadway Plaza. Overall, the first phase has 84% of the space under signed leases, and we expect to add more retailers to this list prior to the May 2016 opening. 
We are also pleased with the leasing progress at Green Acres Commons, a 335,000 square foot power center located adjacent to Green Acres Mall. The center has executed leases on 75% of the space and will be anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, Ashley Furniture and Burlington as well as a number of freestanding restaurants. We are planning a fourth quarter 2016 opening. Century 21 held a very successful store opening yesterday at Green Acres Mall. We believe the addition of this unique 70,000 square foot department store will significantly add to the market penetration of this center. 
We are also seeing the impact of adding theaters to some of our premier assets, including Santa Monica Place, Scottsdale Fashion Square and Los Cerritos. These theaters, which will open in the coming months, have increased demand from high-quality restaurants, fast casual food concepts and specialty stores. Restaurants opening during the fourth quarter include Cheesecake Factory at Santa Monica Place and Los Cerritos as well as Shake Shack at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Looking forward, we continue to make progress on the redevelopment of the existing Sears store at Kings Plaza as well as the preleasing for the outlet centers in Philadelphia and San Francisco. We expect to discuss these developments in the coming months. 
Art and Tom have both spoken in the past about our renewed emphasis on our common areas. We are focused on enhancing the revenue generation and elevating the customer experience with a particular emphasis on fortress assets for both permanent kiosks and business development opportunities. We are forecasting by the end of the year 2015, the in-place annualized permanent kiosk revenue will have increased over 20% as compared to the previous year. Illustrative of the commitment to quality at Santa Monica Place, we have been able to attract such users as Starbucks; Aesop, which is a high-end U.K. skincare company; and Press Juice into the common areas. All of these will impact revenue and enhance our customer experience.
Looking towards end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years. Many of these retailers are public companies. And based on their current stock prices, the markets are pricing in a significant risk of bankruptcy. Contrary to the previous year, we are expecting less store closings as part of the bankruptcies as many of the retailers are prime candidates for restructuring with a smaller store base. Again, we believe the lower-quality centers will be disproportionately impacted.
In conclusion, the performance during the first 3 quarters reflects a continuing demand from retailers for locations in high-quality centers that serve dense and affluent trade areas. The company's focus on better-quality centers with a significant presence on both coasts is consistent with many retailers' brick-and-mortar expansion plans. The impact of the capital recycling that has occurred during the past 3 years is very evident in the year-to-date results, and we believe positions Macerich well into the coming years. Tom?"

So that still puts us at 4.6% growth rate in the quarter, excluding the expenses that helped drive the number up to 7%. As I mentioned earlier in the call, fourth quarter, we don't expect to be that high because we include lease termination revenues. That's cash revenue to us. It's an active part of the mall business, whether you make the decision to recapture space, take some cash now and create a vacancy or not. So we included it in our definition of same-center NOI. And in the fourth quarter last year, we had about $6.8 million of lease termination revenue. Our projection for the fourth quarter of this year is about $1 million to $2 million. So that's about $4.8 million that's going to have an adverse affect on that same-center NOI number in the fourth quarter. So we think the fourth quarter will be more like 4.5% or so.

And it obviously is more expensive to operate a center in an urban area like New York than a suburban market. But I think we stepped forward about 9 months ago and said that we were committing to push for margin improvement of about 400 basis points over the next 2 years. We picked up 250 basis points already for the -- through the first 3 quarters of that 2-year period, and we'll continue to push forward. Bob mentioned some of the strides that we've made on common area leasing. That's going to be a good, big part of it. We made some expense cuts this year that will carry forward, but you can't do that every year to the same level. But they have contributed significantly this year. But I think we're going to continue to see the revenue growth, and we're going to continue to see that improvement as we go through the course of the next 4 or 5 quarters."

That's obviously a different market than the U.S. And they've opened their first store in Boston here last month. I'm just curious, as you think about the addition of Primark to 2 of your centers, taking some of that Sears space, what do you anticipate will be the impact on traffic and perhaps sales levels from retailers who might be deemed to be competitive with their merchandise mix and price point?"

We've been talking to them for 2, 3 years, not only because we feel that they will make an impact, but we feel our centers, in particular on the East Coast, are very well aligned with what their store expansion plans are. So right now, there's 2 transactions that are part of the Sears portfolio, but we are also having a number of other discussions with them. And again, we believe our centers line up very much with what their store expansion will be. We are very impressed with the amount of traffic they generate, and we're obviously very impressed with their pricing. But we're also very impressed with the physical box that they build and the way that they handle the traffic through their store. We believe their stores will take volume from multiple people both inside and outside the mall, both some fast fashion specialty format retailers but also some big box and apparel retailers outside the mall. So we really, Jim, see their impact as more than just taking market share from mall tenants. We see it as impacting many different venues. I think what you'll see is you will see the retailers adjust and become potentially even more competitive in terms of their pricing policy. And it will force the retailers to become better at providing the merchandise to the customers at a more affordable price."

But I'm curious on the stock buyback why you haven't crystallized a more firmer plan and why you're just not just doing a Dutch tender to take back and do it all at once rather than leaving some of this uncertainty. I guess, I'm curious why a decision hasn't been made as you knew this was coming."
