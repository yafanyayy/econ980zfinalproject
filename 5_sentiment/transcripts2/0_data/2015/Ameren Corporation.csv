Today, we announced 2014 earnings of $2.40 per share within the upper end of our 2014 guidance range. This represents a 14% increase over 2013 results. This strong earnings growth reflected increased on electric delivery and FERC-regulated transmission earnings under formula ratemaking which were driven by infrastructure investments made to better serve our customers. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from increased rates from Illinois natural gas delivery, decreased interest charges, the substantial elimination of parent company cost previously allocated to the divested merchant generation business and the absence of the Missouri fuel adjustment-clause-related charge taken in 2013. Marty will discuss these and other 2014 earnings drivers in a few minutes. 
Turning to Page 5. Last year at this time, we discussed how excited we were about our strategy for investing in and growing our rate-regulated electric and gas utilities in order to provide superior value for our shareholders and customers. Today, I am pleased to report on our successful execution of the strategy in 2014. The first element of our strategy is to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. Towards this end, in 2014, we allocated significant amounts of discretionary capital to those businesses where investment is supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. Our customers are seeing tangible results from these investment activities. In particular, we invested more than $1 billion in our FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure to better serve our customers. In transmission company of Illinois or ATXI, began construction of the Illinois Rivers project and achieved all planned 2014 milestones. Word were obtained for approximately half of the properties along the projects route. Construction was begun on 6 of the 10 substations and nearly all of the foundations on an initial line segment were completed. In addition, Ameren Illinois installed almost 47,000 new electric and 26,000 upgraded gas meters, exceeding the first-year goal of its advanced metering infrastructure project. Further, Ameren Missouri placed into service several key infrastructure projects by year-end, including the new reactor vessel head at the Callaway Energy Center, additional environmental controls at the Labadie energy center and major substation in St. Louis and the largest investor-owned solar generation facility in the state. These projects already serving customers, improving reliability and providing energy from cleaner generation sources and they are eligible for included in new rates expected to be effective by early June of this year. We also achieved notable regulatory successes last year, including a constructive outcome in our Illinois electric delivery rate case. In this case, the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized a rate increase of $204 million, an amount that was within $1 million of our updated request, demonstrated that the formula ratemaking framework is working as intended. Even with this rate increase, rates are still expected to remain below 2011 levels for most customers. Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on operational improvement and disciplined cost management as reflected in the significant reduction in parent company cost. 
The second element of our strategy is to enhance revelatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy policies. On this front, the Illinois General Assembly overwhelmingly passed legislation, extending the constructive formula-based electric delivery rate framework by 2 years through the end of 2019. This legislation has now been submitted to Governor Rod R. Further, we aggressively advocated for responsible energy policies, notably in the environmental area. In particular, we raise concerns regarding the impact on customers rates and electrical liability of the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan. But we did more than just raise concerns. We offered pragmatic solutions to address these important concerns and our comments to the EPA's proposed rules in December. The EPA's expected to finalize its rules later this year. 
Regarding the third element of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investments for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, I will highlight 3 areas of activity. In October, we filed an updated, integrated resource plan, with the Missouri Public Service Commission outlining our ongoing transition to a cleaner and more fuel diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion over the next 20 years. This plan maximizes the use of our current coal fire generation fleet for the benefit of our customers while leveraging energy efficiency and investments in renewables, environmental controls and gas-fired generation to meet future needs in an environmentally balanced manner. And the plan also includes extending the useful life of our Callaway Nuclear Energy Center from 40 to 60 years. Our preferred plant is also projected to achieve the ultimate carbon emission reductions proposed by the EPA and it's Clean Power Plan by 2035. Rather than EPA's final target date of 2030 towards aggressive interim target date beginning in 2020. Importantly, our plan was significantly reduced reliability issues and economic costs of the Clean Power Plan for our customers while still achieving significant carbon emission reduction. Next, our transmission team continues to identify reliability projects that are important for customers here in our service territory while pursuing additional, competitive investment opportunities, both here and beyond as we were to leverage our success as an experienced transmission developer and operator. 
Finally, we will continue to move forward in executing our Illinois Modernization Action Plan or MAP, for upgrading our electric and natural gas delivery systems. 
Turning now to Page 6. In summary, the successful execution of our strategy last year delivered positive results for both our customers and shareholders. On the operating front, it was another year of solid safety performance as well as strong electric distribution system reliability and baseload energy center performance. In addition, our electric rates remained well below regional and national averages and customer satisfaction improved. 
Moving to financial performance. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2014 as I previously mentioned. Ameren, as a whole, also earned a higher return on equity. Further, the Board of Directors expressed confidence in our long-term outlook by increasing our quarterly dividend while we maintain financial strength and flexibility. I am pleased with the progress we made last year and we are continuing the momentum into this year. 
Turning now to Page 7. We anticipate that 2015 will be another year of solid earnings growth, with results expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. The primary growth drivers are noted on this page and Marty will discuss them in more detail in a few minutes. 
Turning to Page 8. Here a key areas for this year as we continue to execute our strategic plan. Our FERC-regulated transmission businesses will invest to regional multivalue and local liability projects included in our 2015 through 2019 capital investment plan. Further, our transmission team continues to pursue projects that enhance the reliability, safety and efficiency of the grid in our service territory, in MISO, and in neighboring regional transmission organizations including competitive opportunities under FERC Order 1000. In addition, we are working to obtain constructive outcomes in the complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the baseload Return on Equity per transmission owners in the MISO region, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. A matter of allowed returns, I am pleased to note that effective January 6 of this year, the FERC approved our request for an ROE incented matter about 50 basis points for both Ameren Illinois and ATXI to reflect our participation in the regional transmission organization. 
Moving to Illinois electric and natural gas delivery. Ameren Illinois will carry on investing in infrastructure improvements under its Modernization Action Plan, which is designed to extend through 2021. This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019. Including approximately 140,000 electric and 73,000 gas meters this year. To support the execution of our modernization plan, we are working to ensure that legislation extending electric formula ratemaking through 2019, which are already discussed becomes law. Regarding our Illinois natural gas delivery service. Last month, we filed a request for the Illinois Commerce Commission for an increase in rates to be effective at the beginning of 2016. At Illinois, we were able to use a forward test year to establish rates in our gas business in order to mitigate regulatory lag. We successfully advancing this request through the regulatory process will be a key area focus this year. In addition, we began using Illinois gas infrastructure rider last month. This rider facilitates needed projects to upgrade aging infrastructure, which will improve reliability and safety for our customers while providing timely recovery of and returns on our investments. 
Moving now to our Missouri business. We are working diligently to achieve the constructive outcome in our pending electric rate case. As we have reported in our Form 8-K filed last Friday, we learned of an inadvertent disclosure of settlement offer exchanges among Ameren Missouri, Missouri Public Service Commission staff and intervenors in the pending electric rate case. The disclosure arose as a result of the distribution of an increment direct e-mail list that included individuals not authorized to receive confidential settlement proposals. The e-mail list was corrected immediately upon discovery of the error and appropriate actions were promptly taken under Regulation FD. Any further settlement negotiations have been and will continue to be private among the appropriate parties. As you know, the hearings in the case commenced on Monday of this week. Marty will provide you with some more information on this case in a moment. 
Modernizing Missouri's regulatory framework also remains a high priority. We are seeking a framework that reduces regulatory lag and supports increased investment to upgrade state's aging electric infrastructure. Toward that end, we continue to educate key Missouri stakeholders, including several freshmen legislators and advocate the legislation that would improve the regulatory framework to support investment. Legislation has been filed in the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives that is consistent with legislation filed in 2014. It is simply premature at this point to speculate whether this legislation will move forward and be enacted. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our plan is not contingent on the passing of legislation of Missouri. Having said that, we strongly believe a modernized framework that supports investment to replace aging infrastructure is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state of Missouri. 
Speaking of modern constructive regulatory frameworks, we have asked the Missouri Public Service Commission to approve a new energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act or MIA. This plan will begin in 2016 and continued through 2018 and will follow on the heels of our successful current energy efficiency plans. We expect to receive a decision on this request later this year. 
Earlier, I discussed our advocacy for responsible energy policies related to the proposed EPA carbon emissions roles. We do so because we simply believed it is the right thing to do for our customers, our country, the environment and our shareholders. And to be clear, should the EPA's final regulation withstand legal challenges that we'll certainly face and ultimately, require us to reduce our carbon omissions in a manner different from our current plan, we expect that our prudent investments to comply with these regulations will be fairly treated by our regulators as they have been in the past. 
Finally, we will continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including disciplined cost management. 
Moving onto Page 9 and our long-term total return outlook. A year ago, we laid out a comprehensive plan to grow earnings over the 5-year period ending in 2018. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm that outlook as we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. Like last year, this earnings growth outlook accommodates our range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels and regulatory developments. That said, our earnings growth outlook is primarily driven by strong rate-based growth. Looking to the 5-year period 2014 to 2019, we expect rate based growth at a solid 6% compound annual rate. We have a strong pipeline of investments that will bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond. Those investments include strengthening our electric distribution system and installing electric and gas smart meters, consistent with the 10-year Illinois Modernization Action Plan. In addition, we will make meaningful investments in our Illinois gas business, to upgrade its metering equipment while also placing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability. We will also execute on an extensive list of local transmission reliability projects, while competing for FERC Order 1000 projects. And in Missouri, we will make disciplined investments to replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure while continuing our transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. This will include investments necessary to maintain the reliability of and add further environmental controls to our existing coal-fired energy centers. We will also include the addition of renewable resources. Looking ahead, we will also remain focused on our dividend as we recognize the importance of our dividend to our shareholders. The action our Board of Directors took to increase the dividend last October was indicative of this as well as the confidence we have in the long term outlook of our regulated utility businesses. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. And as I stated a moment ago, we are focused on delivering strong earnings growth as we execute our well-defined strategic plan. In closing, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board and I am firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. Again, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call and I will now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $2.40 per share for 2014 compared to $2.10 per share for 2013. Key drivers of this increase are listed on this page. Factors favorably affecting the earnings comparison included increased  Illinois electric delivery and FERC-regulated transmission earnings, totaling $0.11 per share. And I will note that this amount is net of a reserve or a potential reduction in the allowed Return on Equity for our FERC-regulated transmission businesses. The reserve stems from the pending complaint cases at FERC which have the potential to reduce the current 12.38% base allowed ROE for these services. Our reserve calculation assumes the FERC we used a methodology similar to that used in this 2014 order or ISO New England. Further, this reserve reflected in ROE reduction retroactive to November 2013 when the initial complaint case was filed. Other factors positively affecting the comparison of 2014 earnings to prior-year results included increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery service, effective January 2014, as well as decreased interest charges. The latter reflected the May 2014 maturity of high-coupon Parent Company notes which was funded with lower cost short-term debt. Interest charges also declined as a result of a December 2014 Illinois regulatory decision, allowing recovery of the majority of debt redemption cost initially disallowed and charged to earnings in 2013. In addition, the absence of the 2013 charge related to Missouri FAC treatment of certain prior-period wholesale sales had a positive impact on earnings comparison. Finally, temperatures had an estimated $0.01 per share positive effect on earnings compared to 2013 as a colder winter in early 2014 was largely offset by a milder summer. Factors having a negative effect on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher effective income tax rate. In addition, operations and maintenance costs not subject to formulate ratemaking riders or trackers increased year-over-year. While such operations and maintenance expenses increased at our utilities as a result of our efforts to improve service to our customers, these increases were partially offset by lower Parent Company cost, reflecting the substantial elimination of business and administrative costs previously incurred to support the divested merchant generation business. 
Before I conclude my discussion of 2014 earnings, I would like to touch on electrics sales results for the year. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customer increased nearly 1% in Illinois, but declined by nearly 1% in Missouri. However, we calculate that these sales would have increased about 0.5% in Missouri, excluding the effect of our Energy Efficiency programs. In Missouri, the earnings impact of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from our Energy Efficiency programs is mitigated by revenue recovery under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers in Illinois and Missouri declined a combined 1.5%. However, in Missouri, such sales would've increased if not for a late year decline in sales word aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Kilowatt-hour sales to Miranda declined because of operational issues at their plant which they have characterized as temporary. 
Turning to Page 12. I will now briefly update you on select matters pending before our state and federal regulators. In Missouri, the focus is on our pending request for an increase in electric rates to recover higher net energy cost and to recover and earn a fair return on infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers. The request also reflects increased taxes, rebates paid for customer-installed solar generation and other cost. Our rate increase request has now been updated for true-up items agreed to by parties to the case. Rate base, capital structure and certain revenue and expense items have been trued up to year end in 2014 and net energy costs and payroll costs have been trued up through January 1, 2015. In addition, we reached a partial settlement with the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission and certain intervenors on certain revenue requirement issues and filed it with the commission on Monday. Reflecting the true-up and the settlement are updated rate increases request is approximately $190 million annually, comprised of approximately $100 million for increased net energy cost and approximately $90 million for other costs including our requested Return on Equity. This updated request incorporates electric service rate base of approximately $7 billion, a reduction from the $7.3 billion contemplated in our initial filing, primarily due to the extension of bonus depreciation through 2014. Hearings before the Missouri Public Service Commission began on Monday and are scheduled to continue for a few weeks. A decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission is expected by May, with new rates expected to be effective by early June. More details on this case are provided in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Moving to regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission. Warner mentioned that we filed a request for an annual increase of natural gas delivery rates of $53 million last month. This case is based on a future test year ending in December 2016 and includes a request for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect Illinois Commerce Commission to issue a decision in this case by December, with the rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation. Finally, the previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the allowed ROE from ISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI are pending at the FERC. Last month, the FERC established a schedule for the initial case. This schedule calls for hearings to begin August 17, with an initial order from administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year. I am pleased to note that the FERC approved, effective January 6 of this year, our request for an ROE incentive adder of up to 50 basis points from both Ameren Illinois and ATXI to reflect their participation in a regional transmission organization. Collection of this adder will be deferred until the ROE complaint cases are resolved. 
Moving to Page 13 of our presentation. Next, I would like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of solid earnings growth, with per-share results anticipated to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. This expected growth is largely driven by the increases at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base noted on this page. Like 2014 results, our projected 2015 electric transmission earnings include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO-based allowed ROE but also incorporates the 50 basis points ROE adder effective January 6. Further, our expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula-based ROE of 8.8% using a forecast of 3.0% for the 2015 average 30-year treasury bond yield. Our 2015 Illinois electric delivery guidance also reflects the absence of a $0.03 per share 2014 benefit from a regulatory decision, allowing recovery of the majority of previously disallowed debt redemption cost. 
Looking now to Ameren Missouri. Projected 2015 earnings will benefit from the absence this year of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center. Such outages typically occur every 18 months and the next 1 is scheduled for the spring of 2016. In addition, new, higher Missouri electric delivery rates are expected to become effective in early June. Until these new rates are effective, Missouri earnings will be negatively affected by regulatory lag, reflecting the absence of our return off and on investments and projects completed since our last rate case, including the major projects that entered service late last year. 
Before I leave the discussion of 2015 expectations for our Illinois and Missouri utilities, I would like to mention our sales outlook and temperature effects. Off to the right, on Page 13, you see that a return to normal temperatures in 2015 would reduce Ameren's earning by an estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2014. Further, we expect weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to decrease by approximately 0.5% compared to last year with higher sales to commercial customers more than offset by lower sales to residential customers as a result of our energy efficiency programs. Net of the effects of Missouri's energy efficiency programs, we expect Ameren-wide kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat. 
Turning to Illinois -- excuse me. Turning to industrial customers. Kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to increase approximately 2.5% compared to last year, with the larger part of that growth expected to come in Illinois. As I previously mentioned, the earnings effect of reduced Missouri electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency program is mitigated under our MEEIA plan. Further, the earnings impact of kilowatt-hour sales fluctuations in Illinois is limited by the 50 basis point collar around the allowed ROE for our delivery service business. 
Before moving to Page 14, I do want to highlight that we recognize that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our earnings outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formulaic ratemaking and pending rate cases. Therefore, on this page, we have provided estimates of 2015 earnings per share sensitivity associated with hypothetical changes in allowed ROEs. 
Moving into Page 14. Parent and other costs are expected to decline as a result of a full year of interest cost savings related to the previously mentioned May 2014 maturity of high-cost Parent Company debt. We also forecast our 2015 effective income tax rate will be about 38%, a decrease of approximately 1 percentage point from the 2014 effective rate. Finally, this earnings guidance incorporates average basic common shares outstanding of $242.6 million, unchanged from the prior-year level. 
Continuing on Page 15. For 2015, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $500 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $1.96 billion of planned 2015 capital expenditures. We plan to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of long and short-term borrowings, including expected long-term debt issuances of $500 million. 
Turning to Page 16 of this presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $8.9 billion of planned regulated capital expenditures for the 2015 through 2019 period. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of income tax deferrals in tax assets over this period. The expected changes in deferred taxes are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures. The tax assets include approximately $715 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state income tax credit carryforwards and expected income tax refunds and tax overpayments at year end 2014. Approximately $440 million of these tax assets are at the Parent Company and are not currently earning a return. These tax assets are expected to be realized into 2017. 
As I previously mentioned, we do not expect to issue any additional common shares in 2015. Further, we do not plan to issue additional common shares via public offering through 2019. Should we decide to issue additional equity at some point over this 5-year period, we would expect to do so by issuing new shares to our dividend reinvestment in 401(k) plans. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Moving to Page 17. We plan to invest a substantial $2.3 billion in FERC-regulated projects over the 5 years ending in 2019, with $1.3 billion of this at ATXI and the remaining $1 billion at Ameren Illinois. Here, we provide an updated cost estimate for the Illinois Rivers project, incorporating the final route approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The updated cost estimate for ATXI's investment in the project is $1.3 billion compared to our prior estimate of $1.1 billion. In addition, Ameren Illinois is building parts of the project that connect its transmission system to ATXI's portion of Illinois Rivers at multiple points. These expenditures, as well as local reliability and expansion investments, for which there continues to be a need, are included in Ameren Illinois' 5-year spending plan. The entire Illinois Rivers project represents an estimated investment of $1.4 billion. I'm pleased to report that the project is progressing as planned and we continue to expect the first section to be completed at 2016, with the last section slated for completion in 2019. 
Now turning to Page 18, I will summarize. We delivered strong 14% earnings per share growth in 2014 and are successfully executing our strategy. As a result, we expect to again deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 compared to 2014. We also reaffirm that earnings per share are expected to grow at a strong 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. Of course, long-term earnings growth is driven by investment utility infrastructure for the benefit of our customers. We expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 5-year period of 2014 through 2019, based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding as compared to our peers. Finally, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 3.8%. In our view, this expected earnings and rate base growth, coupled with our dividend yield, add up to a very attractive total return proposition for investors. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

There was a December order that FERC issued relative to another company which we believe gave better clarification as to how the FERC's going to think about computing the ROEs for the various refund periods that exists with respect to these complained filings. So using the ISO New England, as well as the guidance provided in that other FERC order, we felt that we could reasonably estimate a reserve to book. I thought it was prudent to do so, prudent to get that reserve book and behind us. And so therefore, we've done that. You didn't ask specifically about the amount.

And I wouldn't stop there. We've taken a hard look and continue to do so in terms of just local reliability projects, to continue to improve the system for our customers here within both Missouri and Illinois as well as opportunities that would enhance just within MISO.

We forecasted to be at about $1.850 billion dollars and we finished the year nearly $1.8 billion. So pretty much on top of where we'd expect it. We are expecting a little bit of an uptick in 2015 in terms of capital expenditures, up about another $175 million as we reported on the call to about $1.960 billion. And that level is a little bit of an uptick, mainly due to the timing of our projects. But if also, if you take a look at the Slide 16 that we provided, where we lay-out our expected capital expenditures over the 5-year period, we're projecting $8.9 billion of regulated infrastructure investment over this period. And that's actually up over the prior year 5-year period. So we back in last year, we said '14 through '18 was going to be about $8.3 billion. Now we've moved to $8.9 billion. So we've added about $600 million of overall capital expenditures to the 5-year, to this 5-year plan as compared to the old 1. So we've added expenditures. We've added expenditures that will translate into rate base growth in an amount that is roughly double what we see as the negative impact of bonus depreciation. So we've more than offset the impact of bonus depreciation with identified additional projects to invest in for the benefit of our customers. And when you look on Slide 9, that's where we actually show then our expected rate base growth. Basically, we're expecting to grow rate base 6% from '14 to '19. That's a very similar rate than what we had before for 2013 to 2018. But you can see, because of that added capital expenditures over the 5-year period, that the ending rate base of projected rate base at $15.5 billion, is about 9% more than what we had last year projected at the end of '18. And so -- 1 should not assume either that the CapEx that we added is a backend-loaded. It's really been added throughout the period. But ultimately, it leads to a rate base number at the end of '19, which is about 9% higher than what we had been projecting for '18."

I think when you look at the gas business in Illinois, we've already, I would say, ramped up some investment there because we do see that as constructive environment as it exists today. As you know, we have the ability to use forward-looking test years for our gas rates and the rate case that we have pending today, as we mentioned on the call, looks out to 2016. It uses 2016 project cost in rate base. I think that's constructive. And then we began to be able to use basically a writer for our qualifying infrastructure projects so that we can actually adjust rates monthly between rate cases to reflect the return of an return on as qualifying products. So we believe there's been enhancement made to the framework, which is actually allowing us to step up investments and we are replacing meter modules and gas business alongside the meter replacement program that we've got going on, the electric portion of the business. And it's allowing us also to make some necessary investments in that business to ensure safety as well as reliability of gas business. I think moreover, Michael, while we may see that we may reflect or spur investment over time, we think -- we think again, the framework is good. But it will be whether we see some additional safety rules that come out at the national level or [indiscernible] that may drive actually investment spending. But we do believe we have the framework in place that if we are required to make those investments, that it will be treated absolutely fairly in terms of the regulatory processes."

The earnings comparison also benefited from increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery, decreased interest charges, the substantial elimination of parent company costs previously allocated to the divested merchant generation business and the absence of the Missouri fuel adjustment clause-related charge taken in 2013. Marty will discuss these and other 2014 earnings drivers in a few minutes.
Turning to Page 5. Last year at this time, we discussed how excited we were about our strategy for investing in and growing our rate-regulated electric and gas utilities in order to provide superior value for our shareholders and customers. Today, I am pleased to report on our successful execution of this strategy in 2014. The first element of our strategy is to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. Towards this end, in 2014, we allocated significant amounts of discretionary capital to those businesses where investment is supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. Our customers are seeing tangible results from these investment activities. In particular, we invested more than $1 billion in our FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure to better serve our customers. Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois or ATXI, began construction of the Illinois Rivers project and achieved all planned 2014 milestones. Land rights were obtained for approximately 1/2 of the properties along the project's route. Construction was begun on 6 of the 10 substations and nearly all of the foundations on an initial line segment were completed. In addition, Ameren Illinois installed almost 47,000 new electric and 26,000 upgraded gas meters, exceeding the first year goal of its advanced metering infrastructure project. Further, Ameren Missouri placed into service several key infrastructure projects by year end, including the new reactor vessel head at the Callaway Energy Center, additional environmental controls at the Labadie Energy Center, a major substation in St. Louis and the largest investor-owned solar generation facility in the state. These projects are already serving customers, improving reliability and providing energy from cleaner generation sources and they are eligible for inclusion in new rates expected to be effective by early June of this year. We also achieved notable regulatory successes last year, including a constructive outcome in our Illinois electric delivery rate case. In this case, the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized a rate increase of $204 million, an amount that was within $1 million of our updated request, demonstrated that the formula ratemaking framework is working as intended. Even with this rate increase, rates are still expected to remain below 2011 levels for most customers. Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on operational improvement and disciplined cost management as reflected in the significant reduction in parent company costs.
The second element of our strategy is to enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy policies. On this front, the Illinois General Assembly overwhelmingly passed legislation, extending the constructive formula-based electric delivery rate framework by 2 years through the end of 2019. This legislation has now been submitted to Governor Rauner. Further, we aggressively advocated for responsible energy policies, notably in the environmental area. In particular, we raise concerns regarding the impact on customers' rates and electric liability of the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan. But we did more than just raise concerns. We offered pragmatic solutions to address these important concerns in our comments to the EPA's proposed rules in December. The EPA is expected to finalize its rules later this year.
Regarding the third element of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investments for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, I will highlight 3 areas of activity. In October, we filed an updated, integrated resource plan, with the Missouri Public Service Commission outlining our ongoing transition to a cleaner and more fuel-diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion over the next 20 years. This plan maximizes the use of our current coal-fired generation fleet for the benefit of our customers, while leveraging energy efficiency and investments in renewables, environmental controls and gas-fired generation to meet future needs in an environmentally balanced manner. And the plan also includes extending the useful life of our Callaway Nuclear Energy Center from 40 to 60 years. Our preferred plant is also projected to achieve the ultimate carbon emission reductions proposed by the EPA in its Clean Power Plan by 2035 rather than EPA's final target date of 2030 towards aggressive interim target dates beginning in 2020. Importantly, our plan will significantly reduce reliability issues and economic costs of the Clean Power Plan for our customers while still achieving significant carbon emission reductions. Next, our transmission team continues to identify reliability projects that are important for customers here in our service territory while pursuing additional, competitive investment opportunities, both here and beyond as we were to leverage our success as an experienced transmission developer and operator.
Finally, we will continue to move forward in executing our Illinois Modernization Action Plan or MAP for upgrading our electric and natural gas delivery systems.
Turning now to Page 6. In summary, the successful execution of our strategy last year delivered positive results for both our customers and shareholders. On the operating front, it was another year of solid safety performance as well as strong electric distribution system reliability and baseload energy center performance. In addition, our electric rates remained well below regional and national averages and customer satisfaction improved.
Moving to financial performance. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2014 as I previously mentioned. Ameren, as a whole, also earned a higher return on equity. Further, the Board of Directors expressed confidence in our long-term outlook by increasing our quarterly dividend while we maintain financial strength and flexibility. I am pleased with the progress we made last year and we are continuing the momentum into this year.
Turning now to Page 7. We anticipate that 2015 will be another year of solid earnings growth, with results expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. The primary growth drivers are noted on this page, and Marty will discuss them in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning to Page 8. Here, we note key areas of focus for this year as we continue to execute our strategic plan. Our FERC-regulated transmission businesses will advance to regional multi-value and local reliability projects included in our 2015 through 2019 capital investment plan. Further, our transmission team continues to pursue projects that enhance the reliability, safety and efficiency of the grid in our service territory, in MISO and in neighboring regional transmission organizations, including competitive opportunities under FERC Order 1000. In addition, we are working to obtain constructive outcomes in the complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed return on equity for transmission owners in the MISO region, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. On the matter of allowed returns, I am pleased to note that effective January 6 of this year, the FERC approved our request for an ROE incentive adder of up to 50 basis points for both Ameren Illinois and ATXI to reflect our participation in the regional transmission organization.
Moving to Illinois electric and natural gas delivery. Ameren Illinois will carry on investing in infrastructure improvements under its Modernization Action Plan, which is designed to extend through 2021. This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019, including approximately 140,000 electric and 73,000 gas meters this year. To support the execution of our modernization plan, we are working to ensure that legislation extending electric formula ratemaking through 2019, which I already discussed, becomes law. Regarding our Illinois natural gas delivery service, last month, we filed a request for the Illinois Commerce Commission for an increase in rates to be effective at the beginning of 2016. In Illinois, we were able to use a forward test year to establish rates in our gas business in order to mitigate regulatory lag. Successfully advancing this request through the regulatory process will be a key area focus this year. In addition, we began using the Illinois gas infrastructure rider last month. This rider facilitates the need of projects to upgrade aging infrastructure, which will improve reliability and safety for our customers while providing timely recovery of and returns on our investments.
Moving now to our Missouri business. We are working diligently to achieve a constructive outcome in our pending electric rate case. As we've reported in our Form 8-K filed last Friday, we learned of an inadvertent disclosure of settlement offer exchanges among Ameren Missouri, Missouri Public Service Commission staff and intervenors in the pending electric rate case. The disclosure arose as a result of the distribution of an incorrect direct e-mail list that included individuals not authorized to receive confidential settlement proposals. The e-mail list was corrected immediately upon discovery of the error and appropriate actions were promptly taken under Regulation FD. Any further settlement negotiations have been and will continue to be private among the appropriate parties. As you know, the hearings in the case commenced on Monday of this week. Marty will provide you with some more information on this case in a moment.
Modernizing Missouri's regulatory framework also remains a high priority. We are seeking a framework that reduces regulatory lag and supports increased investment to upgrade the state's aging electric infrastructure. Toward that end, we continue to educate key Missouri stakeholders, including several freshmen legislators and advocate the legislation that would improve the regulatory framework to support investment. Legislation has been filed in the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives that is consistent with legislation filed in 2014. It is simply premature at this point to speculate whether this legislation will move forward and be enacted. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our plan is not contingent on the passage of legislation in Missouri. Having said that, we strongly believe a modernized framework that supports investment to replace aging infrastructure is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state of Missouri.
Speaking of modern constructive regulatory frameworks, we have asked the Missouri Public Service Commission to approve a new energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act or MEEIA. This plan will begin in 2016 and continued through 2018 and will follow on the heels of our successful current energy efficiency plan. We expect to receive a decision on this request later this year.
Earlier, I discussed our advocacy for responsible energy policies related to the proposed EPA carbon emission rules. We do so because we simply believe it is the right thing to do for our customers, our country, the environment and our shareholders. And to be clear, should the EPA's final regulations withstand the legal challenges that we'll certainly face, and ultimately, require us to reduce our carbon emissions in a manner different from our current plan, we expect that our prudent investments to comply with these regulations will be fairly treated by our regulators as they have been in the past.
Finally, we will continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including disciplined cost management.
Moving on to Page 9 in our long-term total return outlook. 1 year ago, we laid out a comprehensive plan to grow earnings over the 5-year period ending in 2018. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm that outlook as we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. Like last year, this earnings growth outlook accommodates a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels from regulatory developments. That said, our earnings growth outlook is primarily driven by strong rate base growth. Looking to the 5-year period 2014 through 2019, we expect rate base to grow at a solid 6% compound annual rate. We have a strong pipeline of investments that will bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond. Those investments include strengthening our electric distribution system and installing electric and gas smart meters, consistent with the 10-year Illinois Modernization Action Plan. In addition, we will make meaningful investments in our Illinois gas business to upgrade its metering equipment while also placing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability. We will also execute on an extensive list of local transmission reliability projects while competing for FERC Order 1000 projects. And in Missouri, we will make disciplined investments to replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure while continuing our transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. This will include investments necessary to maintain the reliability of and add further environmental controls to our existing coal-fired energy centers. It will also include the addition of renewable resources. Looking ahead, we will also remain focused on our dividend as we recognize the importance of our dividend to our shareholders. The action our Board of Directors took to increase the dividend last October was indicative of this as well as the confidence we have in the long-term outlook of our regulated utility businesses. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. And as I stated a moment ago, we are focused on delivering strong earnings growth as we execute our well-defined strategic plan. In closing, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board and I am firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. Again, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call and I will now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"
373264,282785390,770137,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $2.40 per share for 2014 compared to $2.10 per share for 2013. Key drivers of this increase are listed on this page. Factors favorably affe",2306,"Thanks, Warner. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $2.40 per share for 2014 compared to $2.10 per share for 2013. Key drivers of this increase are listed on this page. Factors favorably affecting the earnings comparison included the increased Illinois electric delivery and FERC-regulated transmission earnings totaling $0.11 per share. And I will note that this amount is net of a reserve or a potential reduction in the allowed return on equity for our FERC-regulated transmission businesses. The reserve stems from the pending complaint cases at FERC, which have the potential to reduce the current 12.38% base allowed ROE for these services. Our reserve calculation assumed the FERC  will use a methodology similar to that used in this 2014 order for ISO New England. Further, this reserve reflected in ROE reduction retroactive to November 2013 when the initial complaint case was filed. Other factors positively affecting the comparison of 2014 earnings to prior-year results included increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery service effective January 2014, as well as decreased interest charges. The latter reflected the May 2014 maturity of high-coupon parent company notes which was funded with lower costs short-term debt. Interest charges also declined as a result of a December 2014 Illinois regulatory decision, allowing recovery of the majority of debt redemption cost initially disallowed and charged to earnings in 2013. In addition, the absence of the 2013 charge related to Missouri FAC treatment of certain prior-period wholesale sales had a positive impact on earnings comparison. Finally, temperatures had an estimated $0.01 per share positive effect on earnings compared to 2013 as a colder winter in early 2014 was largely offset by a milder summer. Factors having a negative effect on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher effective income tax rate. In addition, operations and maintenance costs not subject to formulaic ratemaking riders or trackers increased year-over-year. While such operations and maintenance expenses increased at our utilities as a result of our efforts to improve service to our customers, these increases were partially offset by lower parent company cost, reflecting the substantial elimination of business and administrative costs previously incurred to support the divested merchant generation business.
Before I conclude my discussion of 2014 earnings, I would like to touch on electric sales results for the year. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers increased nearly 1% in Illinois, but declined by nearly 1% in Missouri. However, we calculate that these sales would have increased about 0.5% in Missouri, excluding the effect of our energy efficiency programs. In Missouri, the earnings impact of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from our energy efficiency programs is mitigated by revenue recovery under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers in Illinois and Missouri declined a combined 1.5%. However, in Missouri, such sales would have increased if not for a late year decline in sales to Noranda Aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Kilowatt-hour sales to Noranda declined because of operational issues at their plant which they have characterized as temporary.
Turning to Page 12. I will now briefly update you on select matters pending before our state and federal regulators. In Missouri, the focus is on our pending request for an increase in electric rates to recover higher net energy cost and to recover and earn a fair return on infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers. The request also reflects increased taxes, rebates paid for customer-installed solar generation and other costs. Our rate increase request has now been updated for true-up items agreed to by parties to the case. Rate base, capital structure and certain revenue and expense items have been trued up through year end 2014 and net energy costs and payroll costs have been trued up through January 1, 2015. In addition, we reached a partial settlement with the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission and certain intervenors on certain revenue requirement issues and filed it with the commission on Monday. Reflecting the true-up and this settlement, our updated rate increase request is approximately $190 million annually comprised of approximately $100 million for increased net energy cost and approximately $90 million for other costs including our requested return on equity. This updated request incorporates electric service rate base of approximately $7 billion, a reduction from the $7.3 billion contemplated in our initial filing, primarily due to the extension of bonus depreciation through 2014. Hearings before the Missouri Public Service Commission began on Monday and are scheduled to continue for a few weeks. A decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission is expected by May, with new rates expected to be effective by early June. More details on this case are provided in the appendix to today's presentation.
Moving to regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission. Warner mentioned that we filed a request for an annual increase in natural gas delivery rates of $53 million last month. This case is based on a future test year ending in December 2016 and includes a request for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect the Illinois Commerce Commission to issue a decision in this case by December, with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation. Finally, the previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the allowed ROE from ISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. Last month, the FERC established a schedule for the initial case. This schedule calls for hearings to begin August 17, with an initial order from an administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year. I am pleased to note that the FERC approved, effective January 6 of this year, our request for an ROE incentive adder of up to 50 basis points for both Ameren Illinois and ATXI to reflect their participation in a regional transmission organization. Collection of this adder will be deferred until the ROE complaint cases are resolved.
Moving to Page 13 of our presentation. Next, I would like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of solid earnings growth, with per-share results anticipated to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. This expected growth is largely driven by the increases at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base noted on this page. Like 2014 results, our projected 2015 electric transmission earnings include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO-based allowed ROE but also incorporate the 50-basis-point ROE adder effective January 6. Further, our expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula-based ROE of 8.8% using a forecast of 3.0% for the 2015 average 30-year treasury bond yield. Our 2015 Illinois electric delivery guidance also reflects the absence of a $0.03 per share 2014 benefit from a regulatory decision, allowing recovery of the majority of previously disallowed debt redemption cost.
Looking now to Ameren Missouri. Projected 2015 earnings will benefit from the absence this year of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center. Such outages typically occur every 18 months and the next one is scheduled for the spring of 2016. In addition, new higher Missouri electric delivery rates are expected to become effective in early June. Until these new rates are effective, Missouri earnings will be negatively affected by regulatory lag, reflecting the absence of return of and on investments in projects completed since our last rate case, including the major projects that entered service late last year.
Before I leave the discussion of 2015 expectations for our Illinois and Missouri utilities, I would like to mention our sales outlook and temperature effects. Off to the right, on Page 13, you see that  a return-to-normal temperatures in 2015 would reduce Ameren's earnings by an estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2014. Further, we expect weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to decrease by approximately 0.5% compared to last year, with higher sales to commercial customers more than offset by lower sales to residential customers as a result of our energy efficiency programs. Net of the effects of Missouri's energy efficiency programs, we expect Ameren-wide kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat.
Turning to Illinois -- excuse me. Turning to industrial customers. Kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to increase approximately 2.5% compared to last year, with the larger part of that growth expected to come in Illinois. As I previously mentioned, the earnings effect of reduced Missouri electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is mitigated under our MEEIA plan. Further, the earnings impact of kilowatt-hour sales fluctuations in Illinois is limited by the 50-basis-point collar around the allowed ROE for our delivery service business.
Before moving to Page 14, I do want to highlight that we recognize that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our earnings outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formulaic ratemaking and pending rate cases. Therefore, on this page, we have provided estimates of 2015 earnings per share sensitivity associated with hypothetical changes in allowed ROEs.
Moving then to Page 14. Parent and other costs are expected to decline as a result of a full year of interest cost savings related to the previously mentioned May 2014 maturity of high-cost parent company debt. We also forecast our 2015 effective income tax rate will be about 38%, a decrease of approximately 1 percentage point from the 2014 effective rate. Finally, this earnings guidance incorporates average basic common shares outstanding of $242.6 million, unchanged from the prior-year level.
Continuing on Page 15. For 2015, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $500 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $1.96 billion of planned 2015 capital expenditures. We plan to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of long- and short-term borrowings, including expected long-term debt issuances of $500 million.
Turning to Page 16 of this presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $8.9 billion of planned regulated capital expenditures for the 2015 through 2019 period. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of income tax deferrals in tax assets over this period. The expected changes in deferred taxes are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures. The tax assets include approximately $715 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state income tax credit carryforwards and expected income tax refunds and tax overpayments at year end 2014. Approximately $440 million of these tax assets are at the parent company and are not currently earning a return. These tax assets are expected to be realized into 2017.
As I previously mentioned, we do not expect to issue any additional common shares in 2015. Further, we do not plan to issue additional common shares via public offering through 2019. Should we decide to issue additional equity at some point over this 5-year period, we would expect to do so by issuing new shares to our dividend reinvestment in 401(k) plans. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity.
Moving to Page 17. We plan to invest a substantial $2.3 billion in FERC-regulated projects over the 5 years ending in 2019, with $1.3 billion of this at ATXI and the remaining $1 billion at Ameren Illinois. Here, we provide an updated cost estimate for the Illinois Rivers project, incorporating the final route approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The updated cost estimate for ATXI's investment in the project is $1.3 billion compared to our prior estimate of $1.1 billion. In addition, Ameren Illinois is building parts of the project that connect its transmission system to ATXI's portion of Illinois Rivers at multiple points. These expenditures, as well as local reliability and expansion investments, for which there continues to be a need, are included in Ameren Illinois' 5-year spending plan. The entire Illinois Rivers project represents an estimated investment of $1.4 billion. I'm pleased to report that the project is progressing as planned and we continue to expect the first section to be completed in 2016, with the last section slated for completion in 2019.
Now turning to Page 18, I will summarize. We delivered strong 14% earnings per share growth in 2014 and are successfully executing our strategy. As a result, we expect to again deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 compared to 2014. We also reaffirm that earnings per share are expected to grow at a strong 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. Of course, long-term earnings growth is driven by investment utility infrastructure for the benefit of our customers. We expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 5-year period of 2014 through 2019, based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding as compared to our peers. Finally, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 3.8%. In our view, this expected earnings and rate base growth, coupled with our dividend yield, add up to a very attractive total return proposition for investors. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And so therefore, we've done that. You didn't ask specifically about the amount, but I can tell you that the reserve that we recorded gets you to an ROE, about at the same place that the FERC landed in the ISO New England order."

Assuming that later this year, we do receive a plan that looks a lot like the draft plan that we received. Could you talk a little bit about, I guess, how you think and your constituents think about the timing for actually executing the plan? There's always litigation around big, big plans such as this from the EPA.

Or would there be a delay before moving forward given the litigation? How do you think about that?"

But we will do our best to drop rate under that, but as we've raised to others, we have concerns with not the just economic impacts, but I think, what you're starting to see in these hearings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are conducting are that there are concerns about reliability risks, significant concerns. And so we're hopeful that the EPA is listening very carefully to the concerns that we're raising, those concerns that are being raised in the industry, but also by those that are experts in the industry to ensure reliability and frankly, those outside of the industry. So we're hopeful that the EPA, in listening to that, will make modifications to that rule to make it acceptable if that will ultimately withstand the legal challenges."

And because of all those things, we believe that there continue to be robust opportunities for us to make proposals and combine that with our operating experience and our knowledge of the system, we believe we have a very good opportunity to enhance our transmission spend and investment because of those. But I wouldn't stop there. We've taken a hard look and continue to do so in terms of just local reliability projects to continue to improve the system for our customers here within both Missouri and Illinois as well as in opportunities that would enhance just within MISO. And so Stephen, I see that with putting those 2 things combined, we see meaningful investment opportunities in the transmission business, and especially that's fruitful when you have a framework which is supportive investment in transmission."

When you look at our CapEx for this past year, we really came in right where we said we would. We forecasted to be at about $1.850 billion and we finished the year nearly $1.8 billion, so pretty much on top of where we'd expect it. We are expecting a little bit of an uptick in 2015 in terms of capital expenditures, up about another $175 million as we reported on the call to about $1.960 billion. And that level is a little bit of an uptick, mainly due to the timing of our projects. But if also you take a look at the Slide 16 that we've provided, where we lay out our expected capital expenditures over the 5-year period, we're projecting $8.9 billion of regulated infrastructure investment over this period, and that's actually up over the prior year 5-year period. So we -- back in last year, we said '14 through '18 was going to be about $8.3 billion. Now we've moved to $8.9 billion. So we've added about $600 million of overall capital expenditures to the 5-year -- to this 5-year plan as compared to the old one. So we've added expenditures. We've added expenditures that will translate into rate base growth and amount that is roughly double what we see as the negative impact of bonus depreciation. So we've more than offset the impact of bonus depreciation with identified additional projects to invest in for the benefit of our customers. And when you look on Slide 9, that's where we actually show then our expected rate base growth. And basically, we're expecting to grow rate base 6% from '14 to '19. That's a very similar rate to what we had before for 2013 to 2018. But you can see, because of that added capital expenditures over the 5-year period, that the ending rate base of projected rate base of $15.5 billion is about 9% more than what we had last year projected at the end of '18. And so one should not assume either that the CapEx that we added is back-end loaded. It's really been added throughout the period, but ultimately, leads to a rate base number at the end of '19, which is about 9% higher than what we had been projecting for '18."

We think that's constructive. And then we've begun to be able to use basically a writer for qualifying infrastructure projects so that we can actually adjust rates monthly between rate cases to reflect the return of and return on as qualifying products. So we believe there's been enhancement made to the framework, which is actually allowing us to step up investments and we are replacing meter modules and gas business alongside the meter replacement program that we've got going on the electric portion of the business. And it's allowing us also to make some necessary investments in that business to ensure safety as well as reliability of gas business. I think moreover, Michael, while we may see that may reflect or spur investment over time, we think the -- we think again, the framework is good. But it will be whether we see some additional safety rules that come out at the national level or outside that may drive actually investment spending. And -- but we do believe we have the framework in place that if we are required to make those investments, that it will be treated absolutely fairly in terms of the regulatory processes."

Today, we announced 2014 earnings of $2.40 per share within the upper end of our 2014 guidance range. This represents a 14% increase over 2013 results. This strong earnings growth reflected increased Illinois electric delivery and FERC-regulated transmission earnings under formula ratemaking, which were driven by infrastructure investments made to better serve our customers.
The earnings comparison also benefited from increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery, decreased interest charges, the substantial elimination of parent company costs previously allocated to the divested merchant generation business and the absence of the Missouri fuel adjustment clause-related charge taken in 2013. Marty will discuss these and other 2014 earnings drivers in a few minutes.
Turning to Page 5. Last year at this time, we discussed how excited we were about our strategy for investing in and growing our rate-regulated electric and gas utilities in order to provide superior value for our shareholders and customers. Today, I am pleased to report on our successful execution of this strategy in 2014. The first element of our strategy is to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. Towards this end, in 2014, we allocated significant amounts of discretionary capital to those businesses where investment is supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. Our customers are seeing tangible results from these investment activities. In particular, we invested more than $1 billion in our FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure to better serve our customers. Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois or ATXI, began construction of the Illinois Rivers project and achieved all planned 2014 milestones. Land rights were obtained for approximately 1/2 of the properties along the project's route. Construction was begun on 6 of the 10 substations and nearly all of the foundations on an initial line segment were completed. In addition, Ameren Illinois installed almost 47,000 new electric and 26,000 upgraded gas meters, exceeding the first year goal of its advanced metering infrastructure project. Further, Ameren Missouri placed into service several key infrastructure projects by year end, including the new reactor vessel head at the Callaway Energy Center, additional environmental controls at the Labadie Energy Center, a major substation in St. Louis and the largest investor-owned solar generation facility in the state. These projects are already serving customers, improving reliability and providing energy from cleaner generation sources and they are eligible for inclusion in new rates expected to be effective by early June of this year. We also achieved notable regulatory successes last year, including a constructive outcome in our Illinois electric delivery rate case. In this case, the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized a rate increase of $204 million, an amount that was within $1 million of our updated request, demonstrated that the formula ratemaking framework is working as intended. Even with this rate increase, rates are still expected to remain below 2011 levels for most customers. Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on operational improvement and disciplined cost management as reflected in the significant reduction in parent company costs.
The second element of our strategy is to enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy policies. On this front, the Illinois General Assembly overwhelmingly passed legislation, extending the constructive formula-based electric delivery rate framework by 2 years through the end of 2019. This legislation has now been submitted to Governor Rauner. Further, we aggressively advocated for responsible energy policies, notably in the environmental area. In particular, we raise concerns regarding the impact on customers' rates and electric liability of the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan. But we did more than just raise concerns. We offered pragmatic solutions to address these important concerns in our comments to the EPA's proposed rules in December. The EPA is expected to finalize its rules later this year.
Regarding the third element of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investments for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, I will highlight 3 areas of activity. In October, we filed an updated, integrated resource plan, with the Missouri Public Service Commission outlining our ongoing transition to a cleaner and more fuel-diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion over the next 20 years. This plan maximizes the use of our current coal-fired generation fleet for the benefit of our customers, while leveraging energy efficiency and investments in renewables, environmental controls and gas-fired generation to meet future needs in an environmentally balanced manner. And the plan also includes extending the useful life of our Callaway Nuclear Energy Center from 40 to 60 years. Our preferred plant is also projected to achieve the ultimate carbon emission reductions proposed by the EPA in its Clean Power Plan by 2035 rather than the EPA's final target date of 2030 or its aggressive interim target dates beginning in 2020. Importantly, our plan will significantly reduce reliability issues and economic costs of the Clean Power Plan for our customers while still achieving significant carbon emission reductions. Next, our transmission team continues to identify reliability projects that are important for customers here in our service territory while pursuing additional, competitive investment opportunities, both here and beyond as we work to leverage our success as an experienced transmission developer and operator.
Finally, we will continue to move forward in executing our Illinois Modernization Action Plan or MAP for upgrading our electric and natural gas delivery systems.
Turning now to Page 6. In summary, the successful execution of our strategy last year delivered positive results for both our customers and shareholders. On the operating front, it was another year of solid safety performance as well as strong electric distribution system reliability and baseload energy center performance. In addition, our electric rates remained well below regional and national averages and customer satisfaction improved.
Moving to financial performance. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2014 as I previously mentioned. Ameren, as a whole, also earned a higher return on equity. Further, the Board of Directors expressed confidence in our long-term outlook by increasing our quarterly dividend while we maintain financial strength and flexibility. I am pleased with the progress we made last year and we are continuing the momentum into this year.
Turning now to Page 7. We anticipate that 2015 will be another year of solid earnings growth, with results expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. The primary growth drivers are noted on this page, and Marty will discuss them in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning to Page 8. Here, we note key areas of focus for this year as we continue to execute our strategic plan. Our FERC-regulated transmission businesses will advance to regional multi-value and local reliability projects included in our 2015 through 2019 capital investment plan. Further, our transmission team continues to pursue projects that enhance the reliability, safety and efficiency of the grid in our service territory, in MISO and in neighboring regional transmission organizations, including competitive opportunities under FERC Order 1000. In addition, we are working to obtain constructive outcomes in the complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed return on equity for transmission owners in the MISO region, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. On the matter of allowed returns, I am pleased to note that effective January 6 of this year, the FERC approved our request for an ROE incentive adder of up to 50 basis points for both Ameren Illinois and ATXI to reflect our participation in the regional transmission organization.
Moving to Illinois electric and natural gas delivery. Ameren Illinois will carry on investing in infrastructure improvements under its Modernization Action Plan, which is designed to extend through 2021. This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019, including approximately 140,000 electric and 73,000 gas meters this year. To support the execution of our modernization plan, we are working to ensure that legislation extending electric formula ratemaking through 2019, which I already discussed, becomes law. Regarding our Illinois natural gas delivery service, last month, we filed a request for the Illinois Commerce Commission for an increase in rates to be effective at the beginning of 2016. In Illinois, we were able to use a forward test year to establish rates in our gas business in order to mitigate regulatory lag. Successfully advancing this request through the regulatory process will be a key area focus this year. In addition, we began using the Illinois gas infrastructure rider last month. This rider facilitates the need of projects to upgrade aging infrastructure, which will improve reliability and safety for our customers while providing timely recovery of and returns on our investments.
Moving now to our Missouri business. We are working diligently to achieve a constructive outcome in our pending electric rate case. As we've reported in our Form 8-K filed last Friday, we learned of an inadvertent disclosure of settlement offer exchanges among Ameren Missouri, Missouri Public Service Commission staff and intervenors in the pending electric rate case. The disclosure arose as a result of the distribution of an incorrect e-mail list that included individuals not authorized to receive confidential settlement proposals. The e-mail list was corrected immediately upon discovery of the error and appropriate actions were promptly taken under Regulation FD. Any further settlement negotiations have been and will continue to be private among the appropriate parties. As you know, the hearings in the case commenced on Monday of this week. Marty will provide you with some more information on this case in a moment.
Modernizing Missouri's regulatory framework also remains a high priority. We are seeking a framework that reduces regulatory lag and supports increased investment to upgrade the state's aging electric infrastructure. Toward that end, we continue to educate key Missouri stakeholders, including several freshmen legislators and advocate the legislation that would improve the regulatory framework to support investment. Legislation has been filed in the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives that is consistent with legislation filed in 2014. It is simply premature at this point to speculate whether this legislation will move forward and be enacted. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our plan is not contingent on the passage of legislation in Missouri. Having said that, we strongly believe a modernized framework that supports investment to replace aging infrastructure is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state of Missouri.
Speaking of modern constructive regulatory frameworks, we have asked the Missouri Public Service Commission to approve a new energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act or MEEIA. This plan will begin in 2016 and continued through 2018 and will follow on the heels of our successful current energy efficiency plan. We expect to receive a decision on this request later this year.
Earlier, I discussed our advocacy for responsible energy policies related to the proposed EPA carbon emission rules. We do so because we simply believe it is the right thing to do for our customers, our country, the environment and our shareholders. And to be clear, should the EPA's final regulations withstand the legal challenges that we'll certainly face, and ultimately, require us to reduce our carbon emissions in a manner different from our current plan, we expect that our prudent investments to comply with these regulations will be fairly treated by our regulators as they have been in the past.
Finally, we will continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including disciplined cost management.
Moving on to Page 9 in our long-term total return outlook. 1 year ago, we laid out a comprehensive plan to grow earnings over the 5-year period ending in 2018. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm that outlook as we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. Like last year, this earnings growth outlook accommodates a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels from regulatory developments. That said, our earnings growth outlook is primarily driven by strong rate base growth. Looking to the 5-year period 2014 through 2019, we expect rate base to grow at a solid 6% compound annual rate. We have a strong pipeline of investments that will bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond. Those investments include strengthening our electric distribution system and installing electric and gas smart meters, consistent with the 10-year Illinois Modernization Action Plan. In addition, we will make meaningful investments in our Illinois gas business to upgrade its metering equipment while also replacing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability. We will also execute on an extensive list of local transmission reliability projects while competing for FERC Order 1000 projects. And in Missouri, we will make disciplined investments to replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure while continuing our transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. These will include investments necessary to maintain the reliability of and add further environmental controls to our existing coal-fired energy centers. It will also include the addition of renewable resources. Looking ahead, we will also remain focused on our dividend as we recognize the importance of our dividend to our shareholders. The action our Board of Directors took to increase the dividend last October was indicative of this as well as the confidence we have in the long-term outlook of our regulated utility businesses. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. And as I stated a moment ago, we are focused on delivering strong earnings growth as we execute our well-defined strategic plan. In closing, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board and I am firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. Again, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call and I will now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"
373264,282785390,770515,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $2.40 per share for 2014 compared to $2.10 per share for 2013. Key drivers of this increase are listed on this page. Factors favorably affe",2305,"Thanks, Warner. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $2.40 per share for 2014 compared to $2.10 per share for 2013. Key drivers of this increase are listed on this page. Factors favorably affecting the earnings comparison included increased Illinois electric delivery and FERC-regulated transmission earnings totaling $0.11 per share. And I will note that this amount is net of a reserve or a potential reduction in the allowed return on equity for our FERC-regulated transmission businesses. The reserve stems from the pending complaint cases at FERC, which have the potential to reduce the current 12.38% base allowed ROE for these services. Our reserve calculation assumed the FERC  will use a methodology similar to that used in this 2014 order for ISO New England. Further, this reserve reflected in ROE reduction retroactive to November 2013 when the initial complaint case was filed. Other factors positively affecting the comparison of 2014 earnings to prior-year results included increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery service effective January 2014, as well as decreased interest charges. The latter reflected the May 2014 maturity of high-coupon parent company notes which was funded with lower costs short-term debt. Interest charges also declined as a result of a December 2014 Illinois regulatory decision, allowing recovery of the majority of debt redemption cost initially disallowed and charged to earnings in 2013. In addition, the absence of the 2013 charge related to Missouri FAC treatment of certain prior-period wholesale sales had a positive impact on the earnings comparison. Finally, temperatures had an estimated $0.01 per share positive effect on earnings compared to 2013 as a colder winter in early 2014 was largely offset by a milder summer. Factors having a negative effect on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher effective income tax rate. In addition, operations and maintenance costs not subject to formulaic ratemaking riders or trackers increased year-over-year. While such operations and maintenance expenses increased at our utilities as a result of our efforts to improve service to our customers, these increases were partially offset by lower parent company cost, reflecting the substantial elimination of business and administrative costs previously incurred to support the divested merchant generation business.
Before I conclude my discussion of 2014 earnings, I would like to touch on electric sales results for the year. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers increased nearly 1% in Illinois, but declined by nearly 1% in Missouri. However, we calculate that these sales would have increased about 0.5% in Missouri, excluding the effect of our energy efficiency programs. In Missouri, the earnings impact of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from our energy efficiency programs is mitigated by revenue recovery under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers in Illinois and Missouri declined a combined 1.5%. However, in Missouri, such sales would have increased if not for a late year decline in sales to Noranda Aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Kilowatt-hour sales to Noranda declined because of operational issues at their plant which they have characterized as temporary.
Turning to Page 12. I will now briefly update you on select matters pending before our state and federal regulators. In Missouri, the focus is on our pending request for an increase in electric rates to recover higher net energy cost and to recover and earn a fair return on infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers. The request also reflects increased taxes, rebates paid for customer-installed solar generation and other costs. Our rate increase request has now been updated for true-up items agreed to by parties to the case. Rate base, capital structure and certain revenue and expense items have been trued up through year end 2014 and net energy costs and payroll costs have been trued up through January 1, 2015. In addition, we reached a partial settlement with the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission and certain intervenors on certain revenue requirement issues and filed it with the commission on Monday. Reflecting the true-up and this settlement, our updated rate increase request is approximately $190 million annually comprised of approximately $100 million for increased net energy cost and approximately $90 million for other costs including our requested return on equity. This updated request incorporates electric service rate base of approximately $7 billion, a reduction from the $7.3 billion contemplated in our initial filing, primarily due to the extension of bonus depreciation through 2014. Hearings before the Missouri Public Service Commission began on Monday and are scheduled to continue for a few weeks. A decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission is expected by May, with new rates expected to be effective by early June. More details on this case are provided in the appendix to today's presentation.
Moving to regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission. Warner mentioned that we filed a request for an annual increase in natural gas delivery rates of $53 million last month. This case is based on a future test year ending in December 2016 and includes a request for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect the Illinois Commerce Commission to issue a decision in this case by December, with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation. Finally, the previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the allowed ROE from ISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. Last month, the FERC established a schedule for the initial case. This schedule calls for hearings to begin August 17, with an initial order from an administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year. I am pleased to note that the FERC approved, effective January 6 of this year, our request for an ROE incentive adder of up to 50 basis points for both Ameren Illinois and ATXI to reflect their participation in a regional transmission organization. Collection of this adder will be deferred until the ROE complaint cases are resolved.
Moving to Page 13 of our presentation. Next, I would like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of solid earnings growth, with per-share results anticipated to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. This expected growth is largely driven by the increases at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base noted on this page. Like 2014 results, our projected 2015 electric transmission earnings include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO-based allowed ROE but also incorporate the 50-basis-point ROE adder effective January 6. Further, our expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula-based ROE of 8.8% using a forecast of 3.0% for the 2015 average 30-year treasury bond yield. Our 2015 Illinois electric delivery guidance also reflects the absence of a $0.03 per share 2014 benefit from a regulatory decision, allowing recovery of the majority of previously disallowed debt redemption cost.
Looking at Ameren Missouri. Projected 2015 earnings will benefit from the absence this year of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center. Such outages typically occur every 18 months and the next one is scheduled for the spring of 2016. In addition, new higher Missouri electric delivery rates are expected to become effective in early June. Until these new rates are effective, Missouri earnings will be negatively affected by regulatory lag, reflecting the absence of return of and on investments in projects completed since our last rate case, including the major projects that entered service late last year.
Before I leave the discussion of 2015 expectations for our Illinois and Missouri utilities, I would like to mention our sales outlook and temperature effects. Off to the right, on Page 13, you see that  a return-to-normal temperatures in 2015 would reduce Ameren's earnings by an estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2014. Further, we expect weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to decrease by approximately 0.5% compared to last year, with higher sales to commercial customers more than offset by lower sales to residential customers as a result of our energy efficiency programs. Net of the effects of Missouri's energy efficiency programs, we expect Ameren-wide kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat.
Turning to Illinois -- excuse me. Turning to industrial customers. Kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to increase approximately 2.5% compared to last year, with the larger part of that growth expected to come in Illinois. As I previously mentioned, the earnings effect of reduced Missouri electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is mitigated under our MEEIA plan. Further, the earnings impact of kilowatt-hour sales fluctuations in Illinois is limited by the 50-basis-point collar around the allowed ROE for our delivery service business.
Before moving to Page 14, I do want to highlight that we recognize that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our earnings outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formulaic ratemaking and pending rate cases. Therefore, on this page, we have provided estimates of 2015 earnings per share sensitivity associated with hypothetical changes in allowed ROEs.
Moving then to Page 14. Parent and other costs are expected to decline as a result of a full year of interest cost savings related to the previously mentioned May 2014 maturity of high-cost parent company debt. We also forecast our 2015 effective income tax rate will be about 38%, a decrease of approximately 1 percentage point from the 2014 effective rate. Finally, this earnings guidance incorporates average basic common shares outstanding of $242.6 million, unchanged from the prior-year level.
Continuing on Page 15. For 2015, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $500 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $1.96 billion of planned 2015 capital expenditures. We plan to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of long- and short-term borrowings, including expected long-term debt issuances of $500 million.
Turning to Page 16 of this presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $8.9 billion of planned regulated capital expenditures for the 2015 through 2019 period. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of income tax deferrals in tax assets over this period. The expected changes in deferred taxes are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures. The tax assets include approximately $715 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state income tax credit carryforwards and expected income tax refunds and tax overpayments at year end 2014. Approximately $440 million of these tax assets are at the parent company and are not currently earning a return. These tax assets are expected to be realized into 2017.
As I previously mentioned, we do not expect to issue any additional common shares in 2015. Further, we do not plan to issue additional common shares via public offering through 2019. Should we decide to issue additional equity at some point over this 5-year period, we would expect to do so by issuing new shares through our dividend reinvestment in 401(k) plans. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity.
Moving to Page 17. We plan to invest a substantial $2.3 billion in FERC-regulated projects over the 5 years ending in 2019, with $1.3 billion of this at ATXI and the remaining $1 billion at Ameren Illinois. Here, we provide an updated cost estimate for the Illinois Rivers project, incorporating the final route approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The updated cost estimate for ATXI's investment in the project is $1.3 billion compared to our prior estimate of $1.1 billion. In addition, Ameren Illinois is building parts of the project that connect its transmission system to ATXI's portion of Illinois Rivers at multiple points. These expenditures, as well as local reliability and expansion investments, for which there continues to be a need, are included in Ameren Illinois' 5-year spending plan. The entire Illinois Rivers project represents an estimated investment of $1.4 billion. I'm pleased to report that the project is progressing as planned and we continue to expect the first section to be completed in 2016, with the last section slated for completion in 2019.
Now turning to Page 18, I will summarize. We delivered strong 14% earnings per share growth in 2014 and are successfully executing our strategy. As a result, we expect to again deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 compared to 2014. We also reaffirm that earnings per share are expected to grow at a strong 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. Of course, long-term earnings growth is driven by investment utility infrastructure for the benefit of our customers. We expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 5-year period of 2014 through 2019, based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding as compared to our peers. Finally, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 3.8%. In our view, this expected earnings and rate base growth, coupled with our dividend yield, add up to a very attractive total return proposition for investors. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

But we will do our best to drop right under that, but as we've raised to others, we have concerns with not the just economic impacts, but I think, what you're starting to see in these hearings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are conducting are that there are real concerns about reliability risks, significant concerns. And so we're hopeful that the EPA is listening very carefully to the concerns that we're raising, those concerns that are being raised in the industry, but also by those that are experts in the industry to ensure reliability and frankly, those outside of the industry. So we're hopeful that the EPA, in listening to that, will make modifications to that rule to make it acceptable if that will ultimately withstand the legal challenges."

Number one, while we've talked a lot about the FERC 1000 projects, we sit there -- we sit among the seams of SPP. Certainly, we have opportunities within MISO, especially with the addition of Entergy and of course, within the seams of PJM. And because of all those things, we believe that there continue to be robust opportunities for us to make proposals and combine that with our operating experience and our knowledge of the system, we believe we have a very good opportunity to enhance our transmission spend and investment because of those. But I wouldn't stop there. We've taken a hard look and continue to do so in terms of just local reliability projects to continue to improve the system for our customers here within both Missouri and Illinois as well as in opportunities that would enhance just within MISO. And so Stephen, I see that with putting those 2 things combined, we see meaningful investment opportunities in the transmission business, and especially that's fruitful when you have a framework which is supportive investment in transmission."

When you look at our CapEx for this past year, we really came in right where we said we would. We forecasted to be at about $1.850 billion and we finished the year nearly $1.8 billion, so pretty much on top of where we'd expect it. We are expecting a little bit of an uptick in 2015 in terms of capital expenditures, up about another $175 million as we reported on the call to about $1.960 billion. And that level is a little bit of an uptick, mainly due to the timing of our projects. But if also you take a look at the Slide 16 that we've provided, where we lay out our expected capital expenditures over the 5-year period, we're projecting $8.9 billion of regulated infrastructure investment over this period, and that's actually up over the prior year 5-year period. So we -- back in last year, we said '14 through '18 was going to be about $8.3 billion. Now we've moved to $8.9 billion. So we've added about $600 million of overall capital expenditures to the 5-year -- to this 5-year plan as compared to the old one. So we've added expenditures. We've added expenditures that will translate into rate base growth and amount that is roughly double what we see as the negative impact of bonus depreciation. So we've more than offset the impact of bonus depreciation with identified additional projects to invest in for the benefit of our customers. And when you look on Slide 9, that's where we actually show then our expected rate base growth. And basically, we're expecting to grow rate base 6% from '14 to '19. That's a very similar rate to what we had before for 2013 to 2018. But you can see, because of that added capital expenditures over the 5-year period, that the ending rate base of projected rate base of $15.5 billion is about 9% more than what we had last year projected at the end of '18. And so one should not assume either that the CapEx that we added is back-end loaded. It's really been added throughout the period, but ultimately, leads to a rate base number at the end of '19, which is about 9% higher than what we had been projecting for '18."

We think that's constructive. And then we've begun to be able to use basically a writer for qualifying infrastructure projects so that we can actually adjust rates monthly between rate cases to reflect the return of and return on as qualifying products. So we believe there's been enhancement made to the framework, which is actually allowing us to step up investments and we are replacing meter modules and gas business alongside the meter replacement program that we've got going on the electric portion of the business. And it's allowing us also to make some necessary investments in that business to ensure safety as well as reliability of the gas business. I think moreover, Michael, while we may see that may reflect or spur investment over time, we think the -- we think again, the framework is good. But it will be whether we see some additional safety rules that come out at the national level or outside that may drive actually investment spending.

Today, we announced first quarter 2015 earnings of $0.45 per share compared with $0.40 per share in last year's first quarter. This earnings advance reflected increased electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois and the formula ratemaking for the benefit of customers. 
Now first quarter results also benefited from reduced parent company interest charges. However, the earnings contributions from these factors were somewhat reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs for the FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery areas of our business. 
Earnings reduced by lower electric and natural gas sales volumes due primarily to milder winter temperatures and energy efficiency. Our solid first quarter results clearly reflect the benefits of strategically allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. These solid first quarter results also provide a good foundation for achieving our full year earnings expectations. 
Therefore, today, we affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance, which is expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Marty will discuss first quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes, including comments on additional factors contributing to the higher results.
Turning to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remained focused on executing this strategy, which we strongly believe will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. 
I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and the accomplishments towards this end. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses where investment is supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, as well as long-term benefits to our customers. 
In particular, we invested approximately $270 million during the first quarter on FERC-regulated electric transmission projects and Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure. $1.4 billion Illinois rivers transmission project is advancing as planned. Line construction is expected to begin on the first line segment this month, with completion planned for next year. And we have begun foundation construction on the second line segment. 
Further, Ameren Illinois' modernization is on track to meet its reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals for this year related to the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. Also, Ameren remains actively engaged in advocating for responsible energy policies. 
In Illinois, policymakers continue to be forward-thinking in implementing constructive frameworks to support modernization of the state's aging energy infrastructure. In particular, I'm very pleased to know that legislation expanding constructive electric formula ratemaking through 2019, which passed by a wide margin in the general assembly is now a law. This enables Ameren Illinois' modernization of the electric good to continue with the regulatory and financial certainty needed to replace aging infrastructure, make investments in new technology, upgrade equipment, higher in train new Illinois coworkers, all in an effort to deliver higher quality service to our customers.
Further, the extension of constructive formula ratemaking was cited by Moody's and Fitch in the recent reports upgrading certain of Ameren Illinois' credit ratings. I believe these actions reinforce that good energy policy leads to benefits for customers and investors.
On the federal level, we continue to collaborate with industry leaders, stakeholders and policymakers across the country to aggressively advocate for constructive and responsible improvements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan. 
Simply put, we have serious concerns with the EPA's current proposed rules. Aside from the legal challenges that the Clean Power Plan will face in the future, we believe that many of the underlying assumptions that the foundation of these proposed rules were unreasonable. 
Most important, we, along with experts across the country, have stated that implementation of these rules in the current form will meaningfully raise the liability risks for the grid, and electricity costs for our customers are projected to rise significantly under the current proposed rules. 
While we have serious concerns with these rules, we're not just saying no. Instead, we have proposed several commonsense solutions, including eliminating unrealistic interim targets and allowing the states to determine the best path to address the EPA's final targets. 
Also, we are strongly advocating that the rules include protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. Our plan will materially reduce greenhouse gas emissions while saving customers billions of dollars and preserving the reliable service U.S. citizens have enjoyed for decades.
In summary, we believe our constructive alternative is the right thing for our customers, our country and the environment. 
Our clean energy plan also includes continued reliance on dependable and carbon-free nuclear generation from the Callaway Energy Center. 
Recently, we achieved a major milestone in this regard. 
In March, we obtained Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for extending the operating license for Callaway by 20 years to 2044. In addition to prudently investing in our utilities and advocating for responsible energy policies, we remain relentlessly focused on achieving operational improvements and efficiencies across all of our businesses, including the continuation of our lean management efforts throughout our organization. 
We have a solid track record of disciplined cost management and aligning our overall spending with the regulatory frameworks and outcome, as well as economic conditions. And we remain committed to our goal of closing gaps between earned and allowed returns on equity.
Turning now to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me update you on some other legislative and regulatory matters related to our businesses. 
Beginning with Missouri, that state's public commission approved a $122 million increase in Ameren Missouri's electric service rates in a decision issued last week. As you know, the primary drivers of this rate case were significant investments made over the past couple of years to improve the quality of service we provide to our customers in terms of safety, reliability and environmental stewardship, as well as accelerated recovery of our aging Meramec Energy Center investment and rising net energy costs for our energy centers. 
While we are pleased that the Public Service Commission's orders allow us for the recovery of these important infrastructure investments and increased net energy costs, other aspects of the decision are disappointing. This includes the 9.53% allowed ROE, which is a decrease from the current allowed ROE of 9.8% authorized back in December 2012. 
In addition, the Public Service Commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses for the fuel adjustment clause and discontinued tracking mechanisms for vegetation management and storm cost recovery.
Lastly, the commission is revenue neutral to Ameren Missouri and will be subsidized by our other customers. We have a consistently stated an economic development matter, which should have been addressed by the Missouri legislature. Marty will provide further details at this rate order in a few minutes.
While we are disappointed with the commission's decision, we are already moving forward with action plans to address the outcome of this rate case. We will request a rehearing on several aspects of this order, including the allowed ROE and the elimination of recovery of changes in transmission revenues and expenses to the fuel adjustment clause. 
As we have done in the past, we will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this regulatory outcome, while maintaining our goal of earning at/or very close to our new allowed ROE.
And finally, we will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of modernizing the regulatory framework in Missouri in order to support investment to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure and to reduce regulatory line. 
The Missouri general assembly is not expected to advance legislation to modernize the state's regulatory framework this year. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our near-term rate base and earnings growth plans are not contingent on enhancement of the Missouri framework. 
As the energy industry continues to change in advance, we remain committed to educating stakeholders and our effort to help Missouri remain competitive and build a grid of the future. We were convinced such an enhancement is in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state.
As a result, we will continue to work with the commission, legislators and others and aggressively advocate for improvement of the Missouri regulatory framework.
Last, with regard to the complaint cases pending at the FERC challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners are strongly advocating for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation.
To that end, we know this filed testimony in April. I strongly believe that the FERC supports additional investment in our nation's transmission infrastructure and will continue to provide a regulatory framework including an ROE that will incentivize that investment. FERC's review of this matter is expected to continue over the next year.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term outlook. In February this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 to 2019 period. We have a strong pipeline of investments that we expect to bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond. 
As shown on this page, the growth rates of our jurisdictional investments are aligned with the perspectives I just shared on our regulatory frameworks. We are executing on numerous FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including multivalue projects such as Illinois rivers, as well as an extensive list of local reliability projects. 
Further, we are making investments to strengthen our electric delivery system in a electric smart meters consistent with the Ameren Illinois' tenure Modernization Action Plan. And we are making meaningful investments in our Illinois gas delivery system to upgrade metering equipment, while also replacing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability. 
To earn the time and return on incremental Illinois gas delivery investments, we began using the state's gas infrastructure writer in the first quarter of this year. 
Last, in Missouri, we are focused on providing safe and reliable energy to our customers as we seek to align our overall spending with the recent rate case outcome. We expect our solid base growth to be the primary driver of superior earnings growth for our shareholders. 
Further, looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize the importance of dividends to our shareholders. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
In closing, we are committed to executing our strategy and we expect this focus to deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. 
Again, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,292803210,807230,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share for the year ago period. Key drivers",1693,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share for the year ago period. 
Key drivers of these earnings increase were listed on this page. Higher electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The earnings comparison also benefited by $0.05 per share from reduced operations and maintenance expenses for those businesses not operating under formula rates. 
In addition, the January 2015 Illinois Commerce Commission order approving recovery of Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage costs increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the first quarter of last year. Earnings also benefited by $0.03 per share from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower cost short-term debt. 
Moving now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. Lower electric and natural gas volumes reduced earnings by $0.05 per share with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline and the balance due to energy efficiency and other drivers. 
First quarter 2015 temperatures were milder than those experienced during the polar vortex in the year-ago quarter or still colder-than-normal. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers across our systems decreased by approximately 1% with about 1/2 of this decrease due to energy efficiency programs. 
In Missouri, the effect of declines in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is offset by lower revenue recovery authorized under the state's energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt hours sales to industrial customers in Illinois increased 2%. However, sales to industrial customers in Missouri declined 4%, primarily due to lower sales to Noranda Aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Sales to Noranda declined because of sustained operational issues at their plant.
Next, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investment at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which I noted a moment ago, was reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this year's first quarter results were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower ROE from the pending complaint cases at the firm. 
The net ROE recognized in our transmission earnings is consistent with the level incorporated into our 2015 earnings guidance as discussed on our February 25 call. 
Regarding first quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.6% allowed ROE compared with 9.7% in the year ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.9% to 2.8%. 
Of course, this year's Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate, which I would note that interest rates have recently been rising. 
Other factors weighing on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased Ameren Missouri financing costs as noted on this page. These reflected in part the impacts of capital projects placed in service by Ameren Missouri over the last 12 months.
Turning now to Page 10. First, I would like to remind you that today, we have affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. 
Moving to the details on this page. Here, we list select items for you to consider as you update your 2015 earnings models. These include the effect on earnings that are returned in normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. 
Over the balance of this year, we expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking. 
In addition, capitalized financing costs are expected to decline this year, reflecting the significant Ameren Missouri capital projects that were in process and ultimately placed into service late last year. 
Earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate, which was approximately 39%.
In addition, I want to remind you of factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016. 
Finally, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost of $0.03 per share. 
Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared with 2014.
Turning now to Page 11 and regulatory matters. Here, we provide details on the recent Missouri rate order. As Warner already mentioned, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a $122 million annual increase in Ameren Missouri's retail electric rates. This amount was comprised of $109 million for increased net energy costs and $13 million for other nonenergy costs. The Missouri commission authorized continuation of 2 very important and constructed cost recovery mechanisms, fuel adjustment clause and the pension and other postretirement benefit cost tracking mechanism. 
However, as Warner mentioned, the commission eliminate our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause. The commission also discontinued 2 other cost trackers, one for vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost and another for storm cost. The commission did state in its order that Ameren Missouri can request an accounting at to defer extraordinary storm cost incurred between rate cases for possible inclusion in rates in a future rate case. In years past, Ameren Missouri has been granted such storm cost accounting orders and later authorized to recover these costs in future rate cases.
Moving to Page 12 and further details of the Missouri electric rate decision. Here, we provide a breakdown of the key drivers of the $13 million authorized annual increase in other nonenergy revenues. 
As Warner noted, we're disappointed with this rate decision and will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this outcome. And as we have stated repeatedly, our objective is to earn a return on equity at/or close to our allowed level. 
Given Missouri's use of historical test years and now more limited writers and trackers, this objective will be more challenging. However, we are clearly focused on the issue. And as we have done in the past, we'll be taking several actions to achieve this objective.
Turning now to Page 13. I'll update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
First Illinois, last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utilities required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to chew up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under recoveries of costs. A summary filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing.
We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a $53 million annual increase based on the future test year ending in December 2016. Our filing also included a proposal for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. The FERC's schedule for the initial case calls for hearings to begin in mid-August with an initial order from an administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year.
Finally, turning to Page 14. I will summarize our comments this morning. We delivered solid first quarter earnings and affirmed earnings per share guidance range for this year of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. 
As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We also continue to expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 2014 through 2019 period based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. 
Importantly, we are strategically allocating capital to those jurisdictions with modernized regulatory frameworks that support investment. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding compared to our regulated utility peers and provides the foundation for superior long-term growth and earnings per share. 
Further, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 4%, which is above average compared to our peers. Through this expected earnings growth, coupled with our dividend yield, translate into a very attractive total return proposition for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And if I miss any of your questions, we'll let you repeat it. I think your first question was about when we're going to file our next rate case. I mean, obviously, we had just received this commission order. We're in the process of assessing the order and also considering what matters we may ask the commission to consider rehearing on. So -- and I wouldn't say we're even through the full process of this one. So it's certainly premature to think about the timing of a next rate case. What goes into that obviously is assessing this order, its impact. As we mentioned on the call and as you just alluded to, we're going to be taking a number of actions to align spending with this rate case outcome. We'll be looking at our capitalist expenditures moving forward and in service states. And all of those things are going to factor into the decision about when a next rate case may be. Probably important to note that this rate case was about 2.5 years since our last rate increase. So no telling when the next one will be, but like I said, those are the various things we'll be take into consideration. You also asked I think about some of those actions that we may be taking to address any lag coming out of this order. And I think that whenever you go into a rate case, it's certainly expected that cost savings that you've achieved over the past couple of years, in our case, helped to mitigate the rate increase for the customer. And that certainly what's happened here. And then what you have to do forward is to the extent that there are not recovered cost or your business that you're going to identify actions that you can take within your business to overcome those to offset those. As I said on the call, our goal continues to be to earn at/or very near to our allowed returns, and that's going to be our objective going forward. And without providing any specifics, certainly have processes underway today as part of our annual planning processes to identify and implement those actions, which are needed to achieve that objective."

Now there are going to be elements that are things that would have to be overcome. Now we'll -- on this transmission piece in the FAC, there, what's happened is transmission revenues and costs are coming out of the FAC and then would go into base rates and would be handled that way subject to potential rehearing on that issue with the commission. I would tell you that today, just to give you an order of magnitude in 2015, we expect transmission revenues and transmission expenses in Ameren Missouri to be around $35 million. However, those revenues and those expenses change over time. And one of the reasons that we view them as being appropriate for being in the FAC is that frankly, those costs are outside of our control and they can be volatile. And to give an example, I think what was put into our base rates reflected a differential between revenues and expenses of about $6 million where revenues has exceeded expenses. So that gives you, I think, some sense of the magnitude of the numbers and the change we've seen here recently. Hard to say what the change will be prospectively. Obviously, again, as I said, those costs are outside of our control. So what that may -- if it's not in the FAC, what that may mean for us in terms of perspective lag is really uncertain at this time."

But that being said, as we sit here today, we do continue to be confident in our ability to deliver within that 7% to 10% compound earnings per share growth range that we previously talked about, which is from 2013 to 2018. As you know, Paul, that growth is driven by growth as I mentioned, it's driven by reduction in parent and other costs that we've been achieving. It's driven by the modernization and reinvestment of tax assets that we have, about $440 million of tax assets at the parent company. And also incorporated in there is our expectation of rising interest rates in achieving that 7% to 10% growth. What we don't plan to do is provide quarterly updates on the long-term plans going forward based on, I would say, short-term movements in interest rates or changes in allowed returns.

I mean, what we're not doing is internally updating our 5-year earnings per share growth outlook each quarter based on changes. It's frankly a fairly comprehensive process that we and I'm sure other companies go through on an annual basis to think about changes in long-term interest rate forecast, long-term ROE forecast, changes in regulatory frameworks, changes in customer needs, changes in technology and really think about what kind of investment should be made for the benefit of our customers, where they should be made, when they should be made. And all of those things factor into in our long-term investment plans and our long-term EPS growth. So we do do those conference of planning processes on an annual basis. And we'll be planning then to roll that out and roll it into the guidance we provide you and others on an annual basis about what our long-term growth plans are. Paul, I would just add a couple of months ago, when we provided our guidance, I was asked a question about, well, are you going to hit that 7% to 10% in the current ROE environment? And what I'd said on that call, and I certainly standby, is that if we held the ROEs that were embedded into our guidance flat through time, we still expect it to be in that 7% to 10% range, albeit potentially the lower end. And I have to say that while we haven't completely reassessed our long-term model, I do remain confident that even with this lower Missouri ROE and holding the other ROEs embedded in our current guidance flat, we do have that flexibility within the guidance range, within our business plans to be able to achieve at least that 7% end of our growth. So that growth, as you know, that 7% earnings per share growth is superior, I think, to the average of our regulated peers. We fully expect that interest rates over time will rise, that ROEs will rise and that'll certainly help to drive earnings higher within that range."

Today, we announced first quarter 2015 earnings of $0.45 per share compared with $0.40 per share in last year's first quarter. This earnings advance reflected increased electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois and the formula ratemaking for the benefit of customers.
Our first quarter results also benefited from reduced parent company interest charges. However, the earnings contributions from these factors were somewhat reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs for the FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery areas of our business.
Earnings were also reduced by lower electric and natural gas sales volumes, due primarily to milder winter temperatures and energy efficiency. Our solid first quarter results clearly reflect the benefits of strategically allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. These solid first quarter results also provide a good foundation for achieving our full year earnings expectations.
Therefore, today, we affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance, which is expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Marty will discuss first quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes, including comments on additional factors contributing to the higher results.
Turning to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy, which we strongly believe will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders.
I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses where investment is supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, as well as long-term benefits to our customers.
In particular, we invested approximately $270 million during the first quarter on FERC-regulated electric transmission projects and Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure. Work on the $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project is advancing as planned. Line construction is expected to begin on the first line segment this month, with completion planned for next year. And we have begun foundation construction on the second line segment.
Further, Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan is on track to meet its reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals for this year related to the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. Also, Ameren remains actively engaged in advocating for responsible energy policies.
In Illinois, policymakers continue to be forward-thinking in implementing constructive frameworks to support modernization of the state's aging energy infrastructure. In particular, I am very pleased to know that legislation extending constructive electric formula ratemaking through 2019 was passed by a wide margin in the General Assembly is now law. This enables Ameren Illinois' modernization of the electric grid to continue with the regulatory and financial certainty needed to replace aging infrastructure, make investments in new technology, upgrade equipment, hire and train new Illinois coworkers, all in an effort to deliver higher-quality service to our customers.
Further, the extension of constructive formula ratemaking was cited by Moody's and Fitch in their recent reports upgrading certain of Ameren Illinois' credit ratings. I believe these actions reinforce that good energy policy leads to benefits for customers and investors.
On the federal level, we continue to collaborate with industry leaders, stakeholders and policymakers across the country to aggressively advocate for constructive and responsible improvements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan.
Simply put, we have serious concerns with the EPA's current proposed rules. Aside from the legal challenges that the Clean Power Plan will face in the future, we believe that many of the underlying assumptions that are the foundation of these proposed rules were unreasonable.
Most important, we, along with experts across the country, have stated that implementation of these rules in their current form will meaningfully raise reliability risks for the grid, and electricity costs for our customers are projected to rise significantly under the current proposed rules.
While we have serious concerns with these rules, we are not just saying no. Instead, we have proposed several commonsense solutions, including eliminating unrealistic interim targets and allowing the states to determine the best path to address the EPA's final targets.
Also, we are strongly advocating that the rules include protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. Our plan will materially reduce greenhouse gas emissions while saving customers billions of dollars and preserving the reliable service U.S. citizens have enjoyed for decades.
In summary, we believe our constructive alternative is the right thing for our customers, our country and the environment.
Our clean energy plan also includes continued reliance on dependable and carbon-free nuclear generation from the Callaway Energy Center. Recently, we achieved a major milestone in this regard.
In March, we obtained Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for extending the operating license for Callaway by 20 years to 2044. In addition to prudently investing in our utilities and advocating for responsible energy policies, we remain relentlessly focused on achieving operational improvements and efficiencies across all of our businesses, including the continuation of our lean management efforts throughout our organization.
We have a solid track record of disciplined cost management and aligning our overall spending with regulatory frameworks and outcome as well as economic conditions. And we remain committed to our goal of closing gaps between earned and allowed returns on equity.
Turning now to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me update you on some other legislative and regulatory matters related to our businesses.
Beginning with Missouri, that state's Public Service Commission approved a $122 million increase in Ameren Missouri's electric service rates in a decision issued last week. As you know, the primary drivers of this rate case were significant investments made over the past couple of years to improve the quality of service we provide to our customers in terms of safety, reliability and environmental stewardship, as well as accelerated recovery of our aging Meramec Energy Center investment and rising net energy costs for our energy centers.
While we are pleased that the Public Service Commission's order allows for the recovery of these important infrastructure investments and increased net energy costs, other aspects of the decision are disappointing. This includes the 9.53% allowed ROE, which is a decrease from the current allowed ROE of 9.8% authorized back in December 2012.
In addition, the Public Service Commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses with a fuel adjustment clause and discontinued tracking mechanisms for vegetation management and storm cost recovery.
Lastly, the commission is revenue neutral to Ameren Missouri and will be subsidized by our other customers. We have consistently stated that this is an economic development matter which should have been addressed by the Missouri legislature. Marty will provide further details in this rate order in a few minutes.
While we are disappointed with the commission's decision, we are already moving forward with action plans to address the outcome of this rate case. We will request a rehearing on several aspects of this order, including the allowed ROE and the elimination of recovery of changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause.
As we have done in the past, we will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this regulatory outcome while maintaining our goal of earning at or very close to our new allowed ROE.
And finally, we will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of modernizing the regulatory framework in Missouri in order to support investment to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure and to reduce regulatory lag.
The Missouri General Assembly is not expected to advance legislation to modernize the state's regulatory framework this year. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our near-term rate base and earnings growth plans are not contingent on enhancement of the Missouri framework.
As the energy industry continues to change and advance, we remain committed to educating stakeholders in our effort to help Missouri remain competitive and build the grid of the future. We are convinced such an enhancement is in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state.
As a result, we will continue to work with the commission, legislators and others and aggressively advocate for improvement of the Missouri regulatory framework.
Last, with regard to the complaint cases pending at the FERC challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners are strongly advocating for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation.
To that end, we and others filed testimony in April. I strongly believe that the FERC supports additional investment in our nation's transmission infrastructure and will continue to provide a regulatory framework including an ROE that will incentivize that investment. FERC's review of this matter is expected to continue over the next year.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 to 2019 period. We have a strong pipeline of investments that we expect to bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond.
As shown on this page, the growth rates of our jurisdictional investments are aligned with the perspectives I just shared on our regulatory frameworks. We are executing on numerous FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including multi-value projects such as Illinois Rivers, as well as an extensive list of local reliability projects.
Further, we are making investments to strengthen our electric delivery system and install electric smart meters consistent with the Ameren Illinois' 10-year Modernization Action Plan. And we are making meaningful investments in our Illinois gas delivery system to upgrade metering equipment, while also replacing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability.
To earn a timely return on incremental Illinois gas delivery investments, we began using the state's gas infrastructure rider in the first quarter of this year.
Last, in Missouri, we are focused on providing safe and reliable energy to our customers as we seek to align our overall spending with the recent rate case outcome. We expect our solid base growth to be the primary driver of superior earnings growth for our shareholders.
Further, looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize the importance of dividends to our shareholders. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
In closing, we are committed to executing our strategy, and we expect this focus to deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders.

Good morning, everyone.Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share for the year-ago period.Key drivers o",1699,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone.
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share for the year-ago period.
Key drivers of this earnings increase are listed on this page. Higher electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The earnings comparison also benefited by $0.05 per share from reduced operations and maintenance expenses for those businesses not operating under formula rates.
In addition, the January 2015 Illinois Commerce Commission order approving recovery of Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage costs increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the first quarter of last year. Earnings also benefited by $0.03 per share from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower cost short-term debt.
Moving now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. Lower electric and natural gas volumes reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline and the balance due to energy efficiency and other drivers.
First quarter 2015 temperatures were milder than those experienced during the polar vortex in the year-ago quarter but were still colder than normal. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers across our systems decreased by approximately 1%, with about 1/2 of this decrease due to energy efficiency programs.
In Missouri, the effect of declines in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is offset by revenue recovery authorized under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt hours sales to industrial customers in Illinois increased 2%. However, sales to industrial customers in Missouri declined 4%, primarily due to lower sales to Noranda Aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Sales to Noranda declined because of sustained operational issues at their plant.
Next, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which I noted a moment ago, was reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this year's first quarter results were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower ROE from the pending complaint cases at the FERC.
The net ROE recognized in our transmission earnings is consistent with the level incorporated into our 2015 earnings guidance as discussed on our February 25 call.
Regarding first quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.6% allowed ROE compared with 9.7% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year Treasury rate from 3.9% to 2.8%.
Of course, this year's Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate, which I would note that interest rates have recently been rising.
Other factors weighing on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased Ameren Missouri financing cost as noted on this page. These reflected in part the impact of capital projects placed in service by Ameren Missouri over the last 12 months.
Turning now to Page 10. First, I would like to remind you that today, we have affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Moving to the details on this page. Here, we list select items for you to consider as you update your 2015 earnings models. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year.
Over the balance of this year, we expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
In addition, capitalized financing costs are expected to decline this year, reflecting the significant Ameren Missouri capital projects that were in process and ultimately placed into service late last year.
Earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%.
In addition, I want to remind you of factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016.
Finally, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost of $0.03 per share.
Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared with 2014.
Turning now to Page 11 and regulatory matters. Here, we provide details on the recent Missouri rate order. As Warner already mentioned, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a $122 million annual increase in Ameren Missouri's retail electric rates. This amount was comprised of $109 million for increased net energy costs and $13 million for other nonenergy costs. The Missouri commission authorized continuation of 2 very important and constructive cost recovery mechanisms, the fuel adjustment clause and the pension and other postretirement benefit cost tracking mechanism.
However, as Warner mentioned, the commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause. The commission also discontinued 2 other cost trackers, one for vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost and another for storm cost. The commission did state in its order that Ameren Missouri can request an accounting authority order to defer extraordinary storm cost incurred between rate cases for possible inclusion in rates in a future rate case. In years past, Ameren Missouri has been granted such storm cost accounting orders and later authorized to recover these costs in future rate cases.
Moving to Page 12 and further details of the Missouri electric rate decision. Here, we provide a breakdown of the key drivers of the $13 million authorized annual increase in other nonenergy revenue.
As Warner noted, we're disappointed with this rate decision and will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this outcome. And as we have stated repeatedly, our objective is to earn a return on equity at or close to our allowed level.
Given Missouri's use of historical test years and now more limited riders and trackers, this objective will be more challenging. However, we are clearly focused on the issue. And as we have done in the past, we'll be taking several actions to achieve this objective.
Turning now to Page 13. I will update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Turning first to Illinois, last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $110 million increase in net annual electric rate to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing.
We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a $53 million annual increase based on the future test year ending in December 2016. Our filing also included a proposal for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. The FERC's schedule for the initial case calls for hearings to begin in mid-August with an initial order from an administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year.
Finally, turning to Page 14. I will summarize our comments this morning. We delivered solid first quarter earnings and affirmed earnings per share guidance range for this year of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We also continue to expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 2014 through 2019 period based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions.
Importantly, we are strategically allocating capital to those jurisdictions with modernized regulatory frameworks that support investment. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding compared to our regulated utility peers and provides the foundation for superior long-term growth in earnings per share.
Further, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 4%, which is above average compared to our peers. Through this expected earnings growth, coupled with our dividend yield, translates into a very attractive total return proposition for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And if I miss any of your questions, we'll let you repeat it. I think your first question was about when we're going to file our next rate case. I mean, obviously, we had just received this commission order. We're in the process of assessing the order and also considering what matters we may ask the commission to consider rehearing on. So I wouldn't say we're even through the full process of this one. So it's certainly premature to think about the timing of a next rate case. What goes into that obviously is assessing this order, its impact. As we mentioned on the call and as you just alluded to, we're going to be taking a number of actions to align spending with this rate case outcome. We'll be looking at our capital expenditures moving forward and the in-service dates. And all of those things are going to factor into a decision about when a next rate case may be. Probably important to note that this rate case was about 2.5 years since our last rate increase. So no telling when the next one will be, but like I said, those are the various things we'll take into consideration. You also asked, I think, about some of those actions that we may be taking to address any lag coming out of this order. And I think that whenever you go into a rate case, it's certainly expected that cost savings that you've achieved over the past couple of years, in our case, help to mitigate the rate increase for the customer. And that's certainly what's happened here. And then what you have to do going forward is, to the extent that there are nonrecovered costs for certain areas of your business that you're going to identify actions that you can take within your business to overcome those, to offset those. As I said on the call, our goal continues to be to earn at or very near to our allowed returns, and that's going to be our objective going forward. And without providing any specifics, certainly have processes underway today as part of our annual planning processes to identify and implement those actions which are needed to achieve that objective."

Now there are going to be elements that are things that would have to be overcome. Now we'll -- on this transmission piece in the FAC, there, what's happened is transmission revenues and costs are coming out of the FAC and then would go into base rates and would be handled that way subject to potential rehearing on that issue with the commission. I would tell you that today, just to give you an order of magnitude, in 2015, we expect transmission revenues and transmission expenses in Ameren Missouri to be around $35 million. However, those revenues and those expenses change over time. And one of the reasons that we view them as being appropriate for being in the FAC is that, frankly, those costs are outside of our control and they can be volatile. And to give an example, I think what was put into our base rates reflected a differential between revenues and expenses of about $6 million where revenues had exceeded expenses. So that gives you, I think, some sense of the magnitude of the numbers and the change we've seen here recently. Hard to say what the change will be prospectively. Obviously, again, as I said, those costs are outside of our control. So what that may -- if it's not in the FAC, what that may mean for us in terms of prospective lag is really uncertain at this time."

But that being said, as we sit here today, we do continue to be confident in our ability to deliver within that 7% to 10% compound earnings per share growth range that we previously talked about, which is from 2013 to 2018. As you know, Paul, that growth is driven by base growth that I just mentioned. It's driven by reduction in parent and other costs that we've been achieving. It's driven by the modernization and reinvestment of tax assets that we have, about $440 million of tax assets at the parent company. And also incorporated in there is our expectation of rising interest rates in achieving that 7% to 10% growth. What we don't plan to do is provide quarterly updates on the long-term plans going forward based on, I would say, short-term movements in interest rates or changes in allowed returns. We take all of that data, of course, into consideration as we prepare our -- do our annual planning and think about where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to modify our longer-term growth plan."

No, I mean, what we're not doing, I would say, is internally updating our 5-year earnings per share growth outlook each quarter based on changes. It's frankly a fairly comprehensive process that we and I'm sure other companies go through on an annual basis to think about changes in long-term interest rate forecast, long-term ROE forecast, changes in regulatory frameworks, changes in customer needs, changes in technology and really think about what kind of investment should be made for the benefit of our customers, where they should be made, when they should be made. And all of those things factor into our long-term investment plans and our long-term EPS growth. So we do, do those comprehensive planning processes on an annual basis. And we'll be planning then to roll that out and roll it into the guidance we provide you and others on an annual basis about what our long-term growth plans are. Paul, I would just add a couple of months ago, when we provided our guidance, I was asked a question about, ""Well, are you going to hit that 7% to 10% in the current ROE environment?"" And what I had said on that call, and I certainly stand by is that, if we held the ROEs that were embedded into our guidance flat through time, we still expect to be in that 7% to 10% range, albeit potentially at the lower end. And I have to say that while we haven't completely reassessed our long-term model, I do remain confident that even with this lower Missouri ROE and holding the other ROEs embedded in our current guidance flat, we do have that flexibility within the guidance range and within our business plans to be able to achieve at least that 7% end of our growth. So that growth, as you know, that 7% earnings per share growth is superior, I think, to the average of our regulated peers. And we fully expect that interest rates over time will rise, that ROEs will rise, and that will certainly help to drive earnings higher within that range."

Today, we announced first quarter 2015 earnings of $0.45 per share compared with $0.40 per share in last year's first quarter. This earnings advance reflected increased electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois and the formula ratemaking for the benefit of customers.
Our first quarter results also benefited from reduced parent company interest charges. However, the earnings contributions from these factors were somewhat reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs for the FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery areas of our business. Earnings were also reduced by lower electric and natural gas sales volumes, due primarily to milder winter temperatures and energy efficiency. Our solid first quarter results clearly reflect the benefits of strategically allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. These solid first quarter results also provide a good foundation for achieving our full year earnings expectations. Therefore, today, we affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance, which is expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Marty will discuss first quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes, including comments on additional factors contributing to the higher results.
Turning to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy, which we strongly believe will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses where investment is supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, as well as long-term benefits to our customers.
In particular, we invested approximately $270 million during the first quarter on FERC-regulated electric transmission projects and Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure. Work on the $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project is advancing as planned. Line construction is expected to begin on the first line segment this month, with completion planned for next year. And we have begun foundation construction on the second line segment. Further, Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan is on track to meet its reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals for this year related to the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. Also, Ameren remains actively engaged in advocating for responsible energy policies.
In Illinois, policymakers continue to be forward-thinking in implementing constructive frameworks to support modernization of the state's aging energy infrastructure. In particular, I am very pleased to know that legislation extending constructive electric formula ratemaking through 2019 was passed by a wide margin in the General Assembly is now law. This enables Ameren Illinois' modernization of the electric grid to continue with the regulatory and financial certainty needed to replace aging infrastructure, make investments in new technology, upgrade equipment, hire and train new Illinois coworkers, all in an effort to deliver higher-quality service to our customers. Further, the extension of constructive formula ratemaking was cited by Moody's and Fitch in their recent reports upgrading certain of Ameren Illinois' credit ratings. I believe these actions reinforce that good energy policy leads to benefits for customers and investors.
On the federal level, we continue to collaborate with industry leaders, stakeholders and policymakers across the country to aggressively advocate for constructive and responsible improvements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan. Simply put, we have serious concerns with the EPA's current proposed rules. Aside from the legal challenges that the Clean Power Plan will face in the future, we believe that many of the underlying assumptions that are the foundation of these proposed rules were unreasonable. Most important, we, along with experts across the country, have stated that implementation of these rules in their current form will meaningfully raise reliability risks for the grid, and electricity costs for our customers are projected to rise significantly under the current proposed rules.
While we have serious concerns with these rules, we are not just saying no. Instead, we have proposed several commonsense solutions, including eliminating unrealistic interim targets and allowing the states to determine the best path to address the EPA's final targets. Also, we are strongly advocating that the rules include protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. Our plan will materially reduce greenhouse gas emissions while saving customers billions of dollars and preserving the reliable service U.S. citizens have enjoyed for decades. In summary, we believe our constructive alternative is the right thing for our customers, our country and the environment.
Our clean energy plan also includes continued reliance on dependable and carbon-free nuclear generation from the Callaway Energy Center. Recently, we achieved a major milestone in this regard. In March, we obtained Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for extending the operating license for Callaway by 20 years to 2044. In addition to prudently investing in our utilities and advocating for responsible energy policies, we remain relentlessly focused on achieving operational improvements and efficiencies across all of our businesses, including the continuation of our lean management efforts throughout our organization. We have a solid track record of disciplined cost management and aligning our overall spending with regulatory frameworks and outcome as well as economic conditions. And we remain committed to our goal of closing gaps between earned and allowed returns on equity.
Turning now to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me update you on some other legislative and regulatory matters related to our businesses. Beginning with Missouri, that state's Public Service Commission approved a $122 million increase in Ameren Missouri's electric service rates in a decision issued last week. As you know, the primary drivers of this rate case were significant investments made over the past couple of years to improve the quality of service we provide to our customers in terms of safety, reliability and environmental stewardship, as well as accelerated recovery of our aging Meramec Energy Center investment and rising net energy costs for our energy centers.
While we are pleased that the Public Service Commission's order allows for the recovery of these important infrastructure investments and increased net energy costs, other aspects of the decision are disappointing. This includes the 9.53% allowed ROE, which is a decrease from the current allowed ROE of 9.8% authorized back in December 2012. In addition, the Public Service Commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses with a fuel adjustment clause and discontinued tracking mechanisms for vegetation management and storm cost recovery. Lastly, the commission is revenue neutral to Ameren Missouri and will be subsidized by our other customers. We have consistently stated that this is an economic development matter which should have been addressed by the Missouri legislature. Marty will provide further details on this rate order in a few minutes.
While we are disappointed with the commission's decision, we are already moving forward with action plans to address the outcome of this rate case. We will request a rehearing on several aspects of this order, including the allowed ROE and the elimination of recovery of changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause. As we have done in the past, we will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this regulatory outcome while maintaining our goal of earning at or very close to our new allowed ROE. And finally, we will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of modernizing the regulatory framework in Missouri in order to support investment to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure and to reduce regulatory lag.
The Missouri General Assembly is not expected to advance legislation to modernize the state's regulatory framework this year. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our near-term rate base and earnings growth plans are not contingent on enhancement of the Missouri framework. As the energy industry continues to change and advance, we remain committed to educating stakeholders in our effort to help Missouri remain competitive and build the grid of the future. We are convinced such an enhancement is in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state. As a result, we will continue to work with the commission, legislators and others and aggressively advocate for improvement of the Missouri regulatory framework.
Last, with regard to the complaint cases pending at the FERC challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners are strongly advocating for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. To that end, we and others filed testimony in April. I strongly believe that the FERC supports additional investment in our nation's transmission infrastructure and will continue to provide a regulatory framework including an ROE that will incentivize that investment. FERC's review of this matter is expected to continue over the next year.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 to 2019 period. We have a strong pipeline of investments that we expect to bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond. As shown on this page, the growth rates of our jurisdictional investments are aligned with the perspectives I just shared on our regulatory frameworks. We are executing on numerous FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including multi-value projects such as Illinois Rivers, as well as an extensive list of local reliability projects.
Further, we are making investments to strengthen our electric delivery system and install electric smart meters consistent with the Ameren Illinois' 10-year Modernization Action Plan. And we are making meaningful investments in our Illinois gas delivery system to upgrade metering equipment, while also replacing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability. To earn a timely return on incremental Illinois gas delivery investments, we began using the state's gas infrastructure rider in the first quarter of this year.
Last, in Missouri, we are focused on providing safe and reliable energy to our customers as we seek to align our overall spending with the recent rate case outcome. We expect our solid base growth to be the primary driver of superior earnings growth for our shareholders. Further, looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize the importance of dividends to our shareholders. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. In closing, we are committed to executing our strategy, and we expect this focus to deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Again, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share for the year-ago period Key drivers of this earnings increase are listed on this page. Higher electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The earnings comparison also benefited by $0.05 per share from reduced operations and maintenance expenses for those businesses not operating under formula rates.
In addition, the January 2015 Illinois Commerce Commission order approving recovery of Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage costs increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the first quarter of last year. Earnings also benefited by $0.03 per share from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower cost short-term debt.
Moving now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. Lower electric and natural gas volumes reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline and the balance due to energy efficiency and other drivers. First quarter 2015 temperatures were milder than those experienced during the polar vortex in the year-ago quarter, but were still colder than normal. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers across our systems decreased by approximately 1%, with about 1/2 of this decrease due to energy efficiency programs.
In Missouri, the effect of declines in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is offset by revenue recovery authorized under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt hour sales to industrial customers in Illinois increased 2%. However, sales to industrial customers in Missouri declined 4%, primarily due to lower sales to Noranda Aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Sales to Noranda declined because of sustained operational issues at their plant.
Next, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which I noted a moment ago, was reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this year's first quarter results were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower ROE from the pending complaint cases at the FERC. The net ROE recognized in our transmission earnings is consistent with the level incorporated into our 2015 earnings guidance as discussed on our February 25 call.
Regarding first quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.6% allowed ROE compared with 9.7% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year Treasury rate from 3.9% to 2.8%. Of course, this year's Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate, which I would note that interest rates have recently been rising. Other factors weighing on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased Ameren Missouri financing cost as noted on this page. These reflected in part the impact of capital projects placed in service by Ameren Missouri over the last 12 months.
Turning now to Page 10. First, I would like to remind you that today, we have affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Moving to the details on this page. Here, we list select items for you to consider as you update your 2015 earnings models. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. Over the balance of this year, we expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
In addition, capitalized financing costs are expected to decline this year, reflecting the significant Ameren Missouri capital projects that were in process and ultimately placed into service late last year. Earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%. In addition, I want to remind you of factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016.
Finally, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption costs of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared with 2014.
Turning now to Page 11 and regulatory matters. Here, we provide details on the recent Missouri rate order. As Warner already mentioned, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a $122 million annual increase in Ameren Missouri's retail electric rates. This amount was comprised of $109 million for increased net energy costs and $13 million for other non-energy costs. The Missouri commission authorized continuation of 2 very important and constructive cost recovery mechanisms, the fuel adjustment clause and the pension and other postretirement benefit cost tracking mechanism.
However, as Warner mentioned, the commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause. The commission also discontinued 2 other cost trackers, one for vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost and another for storm costs. The commission did state in its order that Ameren Missouri can request an accounting authority order to defer extraordinary storm costs incurred between rate cases for possible inclusion in rates in a future rate case. In years past, Ameren Missouri has been granted such storm cost accounting orders and later authorized to recover these costs in future rate cases.
Moving to Page 12 and further details of the Missouri electric rate decision. Here, we provide a breakdown of the key drivers of the $13 million authorized annual increase in other nonenergy revenue. As Warner noted, we're disappointed with this rate decision and will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this outcome. And as we have stated repeatedly, our objective is to earn a return on equity at or close to our allowed level. Given Missouri's use of historical test years and now more limited riders and trackers, this objective will be more challenging. However, we are clearly focused on the issue. And as we have done in the past, we'll be taking several actions to achieve this objective.
Turning now to Page 13. I will update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Turning first to Illinois, last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing.
We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a $53 million annual increase based on the future test year ending in December 2016. Our filing also included a proposal for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. The FERC's schedule for the initial case calls for hearings to begin in mid-August with an initial order from an administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year.
Finally, turning to Page 14. I will summarize our comments this morning. We delivered solid first quarter earnings and affirmed earnings per share guidance range for this year of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We also continue to expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 2014 through 2019 period based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions.
Importantly, we are strategically allocating capital to those jurisdictions with modernized regulatory frameworks that support investment. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding compared to our regulated utility peers and provides the foundation for superior long-term growth in earnings per share. Further, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 4%, which is above average compared to our peers. Through this expected earnings growth, coupled with our dividend yield, translates into a very attractive total return proposition for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And if I miss any of your questions, we'll let you repeat it. I think your first question was about when we're going to file our next rate case. I mean, obviously, we just received this commission order. We're in the process of assessing the order and also considering what matters we may ask the commission to consider rehearing on. So I wouldn't say we're even through the full process of this one. So it's certainly premature to think about the timing of a next rate case. What goes into that obviously is assessing this order, its impact. As we mentioned on the call and as you just alluded to, we're going to be taking a number of actions to align spending with this rate case outcome. We'll be looking at our capital expenditures moving forward and the in-service dates. And all of those things are going to factor into a decision about when a next rate case may be. Probably important to note that this rate case was about 2.5 years since our last rate increase. So no telling when the next one will be, but like I said, those are the various things we'll take into consideration. You also asked, I think, about some of those actions that we may be taking to address any lag coming out of this order. And I think that whenever you go into a rate case, it's certainly expected that cost savings that you've achieved over the past couple of years, in our case, help to mitigate the rate increase for the customer. And that's certainly what's happened here. And then what you have to do going forward is, to the extent that there are nonrecovered costs for certain areas of your business that you're going to identify actions that you can take within your business to overcome those, to offset those. As I said on the call, our goal continues to be to earn at or very near to our allowed returns, and that's going to be our objective going forward. And without providing any specifics, certainly have processes underway today as part of our annual planning processes to identify and implement those actions which are needed to achieve that objective."

Now there are going to be elements that are things that would have to be overcome. Now we'll -- on this transmission piece in the FAC, there, what's happened is transmission revenues and costs are coming out of the FAC and then would go into base rates and would be handled that way subject to potential rehearing on that issue with the commission. I would tell you that today, just to give you an order of magnitude, in 2015, we expect transmission revenues and transmission expenses in Ameren Missouri to be around $35 million. However, those revenues and those expenses change over time. And one of the reasons that we view them as being appropriate for being in the FAC is that, frankly, those costs are outside of our control and they can be volatile. And to give an example, I think what was put into our base rates reflected a differential between revenues and expenses of about $6 million where revenues had exceeded expenses. So that gives you, I think, some sense of the magnitude of the numbers and the change we've seen here recently. Hard to say what the change will be prospectively. Obviously, again, as I said, those costs are outside of our control. So what that may -- if it's not in the FAC, what that may mean for us in terms of prospective lag is really uncertain at this time."

But that being said, as we sit here today, we do continue to be confident in our ability to deliver within that 7% to 10% compound earnings per share growth range that we previously talked about, which is from 2013 to 2018. As you know, Paul, that growth is driven by base growth that I just mentioned. It's driven by reduction in parent and other costs that we've been achieving. It's driven by the modernization and reinvestment of tax assets that we have, about $440 million of tax assets at the parent company. And also incorporated in there is our expectation of rising interest rates in achieving that 7% to 10% growth. What we don't plan to do is provide quarterly updates on the long-term plans going forward based on, I would say, short-term movements in interest rates or changes in allowed returns.

No, I mean, what we're not doing, I would say, is internally updating our 5-year earnings per share growth outlook each quarter based on changes. It's frankly a fairly comprehensive process that we and I'm sure other companies go through on an annual basis to think about changes in long-term interest rate forecast, long-term ROE forecast, changes in regulatory frameworks, changes in customer needs, changes in technology and really think about what kinds of investment should be made for the benefit of our customers, where they should be made, when they should be made. And all of those things factor into our long-term investment plans and our long-term EPS growth. So we do, do those comprehensive planning processes on an annual basis. And we'll be planning then to roll that out and roll it into the guidance we provide you and others on an annual basis about what our long-term growth plans are. Paul, I would just add a couple months ago, when we provided our guidance, I was asked a question about, ""Well, are you going to hit that 7% to 10% in the current ROE environment?"" And what I'd said on that call, and I certainly stand by is that, if we held the ROEs that were embedded into our guidance flat through time, we still expect to be in that 7% to 10% range, albeit potentially at the lower end. And I have to say that while we haven't completely reassessed our long-term model, I do remain confident that even with this lower Missouri ROE and holding the other ROEs embedded in our current guidance flat, we do have that flexibility within the guidance range and within our business plans to be able to achieve at least that 7% end of our growth. So and that growth, as you know, that 7% earnings per share growth is superior, I think, to the average of our regulated peers. And we fully expect that interest rates over time will rise, that ROEs will rise, and that will certainly help to drive earnings higher within that range."

But we're not necessarily relying on that to provide our future growth pipeline. We have a great deal of investment opportunity remaining in our utility systems, both for reliability needs, aging infrastructure replacement and modernization of the grid. We also expect the Clean Power Plan will likely have some impact on the generation fleet in our service territory, which will also drive local transmission projects.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with core earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's second quarter. Results reported today, we remain on",2397,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with core earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's second quarter. Results reported today, we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 and expect that 2015 core earnings to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Key drivers of our second quarter core earnings are listed on this page. I will highlight a couple of them and Marty will discuss each of these drivers later in the call. Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These incremental investments continue to be targeted towards our electric transmission and delivery businesses that operate on their formulated ratemaking. However, in the second quarter of 2015, milder weather grow retail electric sales volumes and earnings lower than second quarter 2014 levels. Further, seasonal redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition in the formulated ratemaking in Illinois also negatively affected the comparisons for the quarter and year-to-date periods, but these effects are expected to reverse over the remainder of the year. 
Our second quarter 2015 core earnings do exclude 2 unusual items. Those are: results from discontinuing operations, primarily reflecting recognition of that tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax position; and a loss provision resulting from this continuing in pursuit of the construction and operating license for second nuclear unit in Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. This relationship and development cost incurred in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in continuing operations. 
While we continue to believe nuclear power must be an important clean energy source for our company and country, as evidenced by the 20-year license extension we received this past March for our Callaway Energy Center, this loss provision was driven by recent changes in vendor support for licensing efforts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our assessment of long-term capacity needs, declining cost of alternative generation technologies and the regulatory framework in Missouri, among other things. Again, Marty will discuss second quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments toward this end. This include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses was investments are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we invested $556 million of our $846 million of capital expenditures for the first half of this year in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This represents about 65% of our first half 2015 total capital expenditures and is an 11% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the first half of 2014. Approximately $300 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects in the first half of this year driven by ongoing construction work on ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well underway on the first line segment but more than 80% of the 132 tower structures already erected. Completion of this segment is expected next year. Further, foundation construction is underway on 2 additional line segments, as well as 8 of 10 substations. In addition, I am pleased to note that in May, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a certificate of convenience and necessity for the 7-mile Missouri portion for the Illinois Rivers project. 
Turning to ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, just last week, Illinois Commerce Commission Administrative law judges issued a proposed order recommending approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, and we expect the ICC to issue an order later this year. We also have a pending request at the Missouri Public Service Commission for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the Mark Twain project in Northwestern Missouri and expect a decision early next year. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved, multi-value projects. 
With regard to the cases pending at the FERC, challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services. We and other MISO transmission owners continue to strongly advocate for an ROE level that is fair, and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. Marty will give you more details in a moment, but I would like to point out that first consideration of these cases is expected to extend into 2016 and 2017. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $250 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure project in the first half of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan. This work, enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, is on track to meet or exceed its investments, liability, advanced metering and job-creation goals. Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as result of electric grid updates. Just the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches and an upgraded distribution rate resulted in 238,000 fewer annual electric service interruptions on average. And when customers do expand out is Ameren Illinois is restoring power 90% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters were ahead of schedule. 
In 2015, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy 142,000 electric meters for customer locations in Central and Southern Illinois. Also more than 330 employees and an additional 1,000 contract workers have been hired to support investment in Ameren Illinois' electric system and operations. As a result, we are on track full-time equivalent job creation commitment. All of these benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois. Of course, all of this progress requires timely recovery of our investments and constructive regulatory [indiscernible]. We are clearly focused on achieving positive resolutions for our pending Illinois electric delivery from the rate update preceding and natural gas rate date. While Marty will cover these cases in more detail in a bit later, I will mention that earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, Illinois Commerce Commission staff, Utility Board, and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case. This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things, which compares to the current allowed ROE of 9.08%. We look forward to the ICC's decision in this case later this year. In Missouri our efforts are well underway to align operating and capital spending with the electric rate order we received in April as we pursue our goal of earning at/or close to our allowed ROE. We are leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts with the natural attrition we are experiencing with our workforce, as well as aggressively pursuing additional cost reductions supply chain, among other things. 
And finally, we are continuing our relentless advocacy efforts of Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders. Our message is simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investment to upgrade the stage aging electric utility researcher in a timely manner and to create jobs. We remain convinced that such monetization will yield benefits similar to those that the State of Illinois is realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole. 
Moving to environmental matters. We await the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final Clean Power Plan regulations, which are expected to be issued soon. In recent month, we have engaged in extensive discussions with industry leaders, state and federal regulatory legislative leaders, including policymakers in the White House and the EPA and other stakeholders. In these discussions, we have aggressively advocated for constructive and responsible improvements for the EPA's proposed plan. Those improvements include incorporating a better path to achieve the final 2030 targets, as well as protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. And importantly, we are seeking to protect our customers from the significant lines and electricity costs, while at the same time making meaningful progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
While I can't predict what will be in the final rules, I am hopeful that the collective advocacy efforts by Ameren and many other like-minded key stakeholders will result in meaningful improvements in the final Clean Power Plan issued by the EPA. In any event, to the EPA's final rules require that we alter and accelerate our transition plans, we fully expect that required investments will be treated fairly by our regulators. Let me assure you that we are committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fueled diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. Recently, we announced plans for new solar facility west of St. Louis. The 13-megawatt Montgomery renewable energy center will be the largest investor-owned solar facility in the State of Missouri and 3x the size of our solar facility, which went into service last December. The new facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. 
One last environmental update. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for match rule. In short, the Supreme Court determined that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals aired in deciding that the EPA was not required to consider cost on a developed rule. However, the Supreme Court decision did not vacate the rule. It remains in effect into for decision by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. This rule is stil in effect and there has been no change in our compliance strategy and we expect to fully comply with the rule before April of next year. The most significant capital project to comply with this rule enhancing the electric static energy was completed last year. That project was included in our electric rates during our most recent rate case in Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrates, and aligned with our previously mentioned strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital, the FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery services. Such investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and they deliver long-term benefits to our customers. 
Turning now to Page 8. In addition, we have consistently stated that we have a strong pipeline of investments beyond those reflected on the previous page to meet our customers future electric and gas energy needs and expectations. To that end, in recent months, we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois electric and gas businesses, which would be incremental to those incorporated into the 2014 to 2019 rate base growth plan just mentioned. Such investments will be directed to the reconstruction and replacement of aging distribution system infrastructure such as lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities to sustain and improve reliability for our customers. Further, these investments include infrastructure capacity upgrades and additions in higher growth areas of the service territory. 
In Ameren Illinois' natural gas delivery business, incremental capital would be directed to gas transmission line replacements associated with the valve and pipeline safety regulations and aging distribution maintenance and service replacement project. 
Finally, in Ameren Illinois' FERC-regulated electric transmission business, identified projects are primarily reliability-related, including compliance with new reliability standards and age-based replacements of equipment. We will evaluate this potential increment on investments over the balance of this year as part of our now normal annual planning process. As Marty will discuss further, given the strength of our balance sheet and added confidence in the strength of our prospective cash flows, resulting from the recent IRS signed off on our 2013 tax return and associated tax assets, we believe we have the ability to fund the growth plans we announced in February, as well as these potential incremental investments without issuing any additional equity. 
Turning now to Page 9. In summary, we have a strong long-term earnings growth outlook driven by above-peer average rate base growth that is focused on a transparent mix of utility infrastructure investments and jurisdictions with modern constructive rate-making that is and uses of future test year. Earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 to 2018. As we said on our May earnings call, we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycle. That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities I just described and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth without issuing an additional equity, certainly bolstered my confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations. 
In addition to a superior earnings growth outlook, Ameren offers an attractive annualized dividend $1.64 per share and a current year -- yield of about 4.1%, which is also superior for our regulated peer average. We remain focused on delivering a solid dividend as we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Of course, any future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
In closing, we believe our shares offer very attractive total return potential for our investors. We are committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we continue to believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and our shareholders. Again, thank you for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Excluding results from discontinued operations and a 2015 loss provision for discontinuing pursuit of a license or a second nuclear unit at Callaway, Ameren recorded second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with second quarter 2014 core earnings of $0.62 per share. Second Quarter 2015 earnings from discontinued operations were $0.21, primarily resulted from recognition of a tax benefit related to resolution of an uncertain tax position. This tax benefit reflects a settlement reached in June with the IRS, which resolved tax matters associated with the divestiture of our merchant-generation business. As Warner mentioned, with this settlement in hand, we have even greater confidence in our ability to fund the growth plan we announced in February, as well as the potential incremental investments discussed without issuing any additional equity, including no issuances of equity through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan. 
As of June 30, our combined tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carry-forwards and expected refunds, stand at $643 million, including $454 million at the Ameren parent company level, which are expected to offset income tax liability into 2017. In addition to excluding discontinued operations, core earnings also excluded a previously mentioned Callaway license-related provision, which was $0.18 per share. 
Turning now to Page 12. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.04 per share decline in second quarter 2015 core earnings compared to second quarter 2014 core earnings. Key factors included lower retail electric sales volumes, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. Milder early summer temperatures accounted for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline with the balance due to energy efficiency, partially offset by revenue recovery authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act and lower Missouri industrial sales stemming primarily from a prolonged reduction in consumption by Ameren Missouri's largest customer, Noranda Aluminum. 
Second quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the warmer-than-normal early summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers in Illinois increased almost 1/2 of 1% and in Missouri, they decreased about 3/4 of 1%. As mentioned, in Missouri, the negative earnings effect of declines in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is compensated for under provisions of the utilities energy efficiency plan. Excluding the estimated effects of these Missouri programs, we estimate that sales to residential and commercial customers would have also increased by almost 1/2 of 1%. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased 3% and 4%, respectively. Reflecting lower sales to a large low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and the aforementioned lower sales to Noranda Aluminum. 
As noted on this page, the second quarter earnings comparison was also negatively affected by $0.02 per share by a seasonal rate redesigned and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking each related to Ameren Illinois electric delivery. These same factors reduced first half 2015 earnings by $0.04 per share compared to the prior year period, but we expect they will reverse by year end. In addition, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois was reduced by $0.02 per share for the quarter and 4 spread cents [ph] per share for the first half because of lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter reflected the current MISO-based allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this quarter's transmission earnings were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. We began recognizing such reserves in the fourth quarter of last year. The net ROE recognized in our second quarter 2015 transmission earnings is comparable with the level incorporated into our first quarter 2015 earnings and the 2015 earnings guidance provided this February. 
Regarding second quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.75% allowed ROE compared with 9.4% in the year ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.6% to 2.95%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate. 
Finally, depreciation and amortization expenses increased in jurisdictions not subject to formerly ratemaking negatively affecting earnings by approximately $0.01 per share. Moving to factors that had a favorable effect on the second quarter is comparison, increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the year-ago quarter, and earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective income tax rate, both of which I will discuss further on the next page. 
Turning then to Page 13. First, I would like to remind you that we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. These include the effect on earnings that our return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. In particular, a return to normal weather in the third quarter would boost earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to the mild year-ago quarter. Over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking. As I mentioned, we have been recording a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower FERC-allowed ROE since the fourth quarter of last year. The cumulative reserve recorded in that quarter was retroactive to November 12, 2013, the date the first MISO ROE complaint case was filed. The absence in the fourth quarter of this year of the prior period portion of the fourth quarter 2014 reserve is expected to benefit this year's fourth quarter earnings comparison. 
Moving to a couple of factors that are anticipated to negatively affect the second half 2015 earnings comparison. Depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to increase for our businesses not operating under formula rates, and capitalized financing causes -- costs are expected to decline, reflecting year-over-year decline in ongoing Ameren Missouri capital projects. In 2014, a significant number of Ameren Missouri capital projects were in process and ultimately placed into service late in the year. Back on the positive side, earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%. In addition, I want to remind you of additional factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of the Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016. Further, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption costs of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared to 2014. 
Turning now to Page 14, I will update you on select pending regulatory matters. Turning first to Illinois. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing with the ICC. Under its formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filings speaks of $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the Appendix to these presentation. The ICC staff testimony filed in mid-July recommended a rate update that is just $3 million less than Ameren Illinois' request. Interveners recommended rate update that are $18 million to $19 million less than our request. As noted on this page, significant portions of these interveners adjustments relate to a position that the ICC has rejected in its past formula rate orders. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning now to Page 15. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. As Warner mentioned, earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission Staff, the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case. This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things. Our original rate request incorporated a 10.25% ROE while the staff had recommended a 9.31% ROE in their June testimony. For reference, the current allowed ROE for this business is 9.08% effective January of 2014. Our annual rate increase request is now approximately $45 million after incorporating the stipulation and agreement that I just mentioned. We estimate the ICC staff's June testimony in this case adjusted for the stipulation supports an approximately $44 million rate increase. In addition to the parties to the stipulation, the Illinois Attorney General filed testimony in the case in June, which advocated a number of downward adjustments to our requested revenue requirement, most of them related to operating expenses. However, the Attorney General did not file ROE testimony. 
Our filing also included a proposal for a volume-balancing adjustment for residential and small nonresidential customers. This would ensure the changes and natural gas sales volumes do not resolve in an over or under-collection of natural gas revenues for these classes. I'm pleased to report that none of the parties to the case have opposed our request for this volume-balance adjustment mechanism. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included an Appendix to today's presentation. Turning now to Page 16, I will update you on some regulatory matters pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As previously mentioned, there are 2 pending complaint cases seeking to reduce the base-allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page. In the first case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended February 11, 2015, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an administrative law judge by the end of this November with a FERC final order expected sometime in 2016. In the second case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended December 31 of this year and the schedule calls for an initial decision from administrative law judge by the middle of next year with the FERC final order expected in 2017. 
Moving then to Page 17. In Missouri, hearings were held last week for proposed 2016 to 2018 Missouri energy-efficient plan. This plan would replace the current one, which has been in effect since 2013 and expires at the end of this year. The new plan would provide net customer benefits of $165 million over 20 years and reflects Ameren Missouri's continued commitment to offering cost-effective and realistically achievable energy efficiency programs for its customers. We expect the Missouri Public Service Commission decision early this fall and if approved, the plan would be implemented beginning January 1, 2016. 
Finally, turning to Page 19. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We delivered second quarter earnings that were solid and we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. In addition, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investment in jurisdictions with modern constructive ratemaking. As Warner stated, earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018, and we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycles. 
That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities we discussed today and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity given the recent favorable settlement of our 2013 tax return, strong financial position and our outlook cash flows certainly bolsters our confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations. When you couple our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which today provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 4.1%, we believe our common stock presents a very attractive total return potential for investors. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Today, we announced second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with core earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's second quarter. The results reported today, we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 and expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Key drivers of our second quarter core earnings are listed on this page. I will highlight a couple of them, and Marty will discuss each of these drivers later in the call.
Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These incremental investments continue to be targeted towards our electric transmission and delivery businesses that operate on their formulaic ratemaking.
However, in the second quarter of 2015, milder weather drove retail electric sales volumes and earnings lower than second quarter 2014 levels. Further, seasonal redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition in the formulaic ratemaking in Illinois also negatively affected the comparisons for the quarter and year-to-date periods, but these effects are expected to reverse over the remainder of the year.
Our second quarter 2015 core earnings do exclude 2 unusual items. Those are: results from discontinuing operations, primarily reflecting recognition of a tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position; and a loss provision resulting from discontinuing the pursuit of a construction and operating license for our second nuclear unit in Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. This relates to development costs incurred in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in continuing operations.
While we continue to believe nuclear power must be an important clean energy source for our company and country, as evidenced by the 20-year license extension we received this past March for our Callaway Energy Center, this loss provision was driven by recent changes in vendor support for licensing efforts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our assessment of long-term capacity needs, declining cost of alternative generation technologies and the regulatory framework in Missouri, among other things. Again, Marty will discuss second quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments toward this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this slide. As you can see, we invested $556 million of our $846 million of capital expenditures over the first half of this year in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This represents about 65% of our first half 2015 total capital expenditures and is an 11% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the first half of 2014.
Approximately $300 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects in the first half of this year, driven by ongoing construction work on ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well underway on the first line segment, with more than 80% of the 132 tower structures already erected. Completion of this segment is expected next year.  Further, foundation construction is underway on 2 additional line segments as well as 8 of 10 substations.
In addition, I am pleased to note that in May, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the 7-mile Missouri portion for the Illinois Rivers project.
Turning to ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois. Just last week, Illinois Commerce Commission Administrative Law Judges issued a proposed order recommending approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, and we expect the ICC to issue an order later this year. We also have a pending request at the Missouri Public Service Commission for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the Mark Twain project in Northwestern Missouri and expect a decision early next year. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved, multi-value projects.
With regard to the cases pending at the FERC, challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners continue to strongly advocate for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. Marty will give you more details in a moment, but I would like to point out that first consideration of these cases is expected to extend into 2016 and 2017.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $250 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure project in the first half of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan. This work, enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, is on track to meet or exceed its investments, liability, advanced metering and job creation goals. Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as result of electric grid upgrades.
Since the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches and an upgraded distribution grid resulted in 238,000 fewer annual electric service interruptions on average. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 19% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule.
In 2015, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy 142,000 electric meters at customer locations in Central and Southern Illinois. Also, more than 330 employees and an additional 1,000 contract workers have been hired to support investments in Ameren Illinois' electric system and operations. As a result, we are on track to exceed our full-time equivalent job creation commitment. All of these benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois.
Of course, all of this progress requires timely recovery of our investments and constructive regulatory outcomes. We are clearly focused on achieving positive resolutions for our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update preceding and natural gas rate pay.
While Marty will cover these cases in more detail in a bit later, I will mention that earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, Illinois Commerce Commission staff, Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case. This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things, which compares to the current allowed ROE of 9.08%. We look forward to the ICC's decision in this case later this year.
In Missouri, our efforts are well underway to align operating and capital spending with the electric rate order we received in April as we pursue our goal of earning at/or close to our allowed ROE. We are leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts with the natural attrition we are experiencing with our workforce as well as aggressively pursuing additional cost reductions throughout our supply chain, among other things.
And finally, we are continuing our relentless advocacy efforts of Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders. Our message is simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs. We remain convinced that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those that the State of Illinois is realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole.
Moving to environmental matters. We await the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final Clean Power Plan regulations, which are expected to be issued soon. In recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions with industry leaders, state and federal regulatory and legislative leaders, including policymakers in the White House and the EPA, and other stakeholders. In these discussions, we have aggressively advocated for constructive and responsible improvements for the EPA's proposed plan.
Those improvements include incorporating a better glide path to achieve the final 2030 targets as well as protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. And importantly, we are seeking to protect our customers from the significant rise in electricity costs, while at the same time, making meaningful progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
While I can't predict what will be in the final rules, I am hopeful that the collective advocacy efforts by Ameren and many other like-minded key stakeholders will result in meaningful improvements in the final Clean Power Plan issued by the EPA. In any event, to the EPA's final rules require that we alter and accelerate our transition plans, we fully expect that required investments will be treated fairly by our regulators. Let me assure you that we are committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel-diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion.
Recently, we announced plans for a new solar facility west of St. Louis. The 13-megawatt Montgomery renewable energy center will be the largest investor-owned solar facility in the State of Missouri and 3x the size of our O’Fallon solar facility which went into service last December. The new facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.
One last environmental update. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards or MATS rule. In short, the Supreme Court determined that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the EPA was not required to consider costs when it developed the MATS rule. However, the Supreme Court decision did not vacate the rule. It remains in effect into a further decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. This -- the MATS rule is still in effect. There has been no change in our compliance strategy, and we expect to fully comply with the rule before April of next year. The most significant capital project to comply with this rule, enhancing the electrostatic precipitators at the Labadie Energy was completed last year. That project was included in our electric rates during our most recent rate case in Missouri.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our previously mentioned strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery services. Such investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, and they deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
Turning now to Page 8. In addition, we have consistently stated that we have a strong pipeline of investments beyond those reflected on the previous page to meet our customers' future electric and gas energy needs and expectations. To that end, in recent months, we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois electric and gas businesses, which would be incremental to those incorporated into the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan just mentioned.
Such investments would be directed to the reconstruction and replacement of aging distribution system infrastructure such as lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities to sustain and improve reliability for our customers. Further, these investments include infrastructure capacity upgrades and additions in higher growth areas of the service territory. 
In Ameren Illinois' natural gas delivery business, incremental capital would be directed to gas transmission line replacements associated with evolving pipeline safety regulations and aging distribution main and service replacement projects.
Finally, in Ameren Illinois' FERC-regulated electric transmission business, identified projects are primarily reliability-related, including compliance with new NERC reliability standards and age-based replacements of equipment. We will evaluate these potential incremental investments over the balance of this year as part of our now normal annual planning process.
As Marty will discuss further, given the strength of our balance sheet and added confidence in the strength of our prospective cash flows resulting from the recent IRS sign-off on our 2013 tax return and associated tax assets, we believe we have the ability to fund the growth plans we announced in February as well as these potential incremental investments without issuing any additional equity.
Turning now to Page 9. In summary, we have a strong long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above-peer average rate base growth that is focused on a transparent mix of utility infrastructure investments and jurisdictions with modern constructive rate-making that is formulaic or uses a future test year.
Earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018. As we said on our May earnings call, we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycle. That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities I just described and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth without issuing an additional equity, certainly bolstered my confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations.
In addition to a superior earnings growth outlook, Ameren offers an attractive annualized dividend of $1.64 per share and a current yield of about 4.1%, which is also superior for our regulated peer average. We remain focused on delivering a solid dividend as we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Of course, any future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
In closing, we believe our shares offer very attractive total return potential for our investors. We are committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we continue to believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Again, thank you for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings. Excluding results from discontinued operations",2256,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings. Excluding results from discontinued operations and a 2015 loss provision for discontinuing pursuit of a license over a second nuclear unit at Callaway, Ameren recorded second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with second quarter 2014 core earnings of $0.62 per share.
Second Quarter 2015 earnings from discontinued operations were $0.21, primarily resulting from recognition of a tax benefit related to resolution of an uncertain tax decision. This tax benefit reflects a settlement reached in June with the IRS, which resolved tax matters associated with the divestiture of our merchant generation business. As Warner mentioned, with this settlement in hand, we have even greater confidence in our ability to fund the growth plan we announced in February as well as the potential incremental investments discussed without issuing any additional equity, including no issuances of equity through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
As of June 30, our combined tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and expected refunds, stand at $643 million, including $454 million at the Ameren parent company level which are expected to offset income tax liabilities into 2017. In addition to excluding discontinued operations, core earnings also excluded the previously mentioned Callaway license-related provision, which was $0.18 per share.
Turning now to Page 12. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.04 per share decline in second quarter 2015 core earnings compared to second quarter 2014 core earnings. Key factors included lower retail electric sales volumes, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. Milder early summer temperatures accounted for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline with the balance due to energy efficiency, partially offset by revenue recovery authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act and lower Missouri industrial sales stemming primarily from a prolonged reduction in consumption by Ameren Missouri's largest customer, Noranda Aluminum. 
Second quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the warmer-than-normal early summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers in Illinois increased almost 0.5%. And in Missouri, they decreased about 0.75%. As mentioned, in Missouri, the negative earnings effect of decline in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is compensated for under provisions of the utility's energy efficiency plan. Excluding the estimated effects of these Missouri programs, we estimate that sales to residential and commercial customers would have also increased by almost 0.5%.
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and the aforementioned lower sales to Noranda Aluminum.
As noted on this page, the second quarter earnings comparison was also negatively affected by $0.02 per share by a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois electric delivery. These same factors reduced first half 2015 earnings by $0.04 per share compared to the prior year period, but we expect they will reverse by year end.
In addition, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois was reduced by $0.02 per share for the quarter and $0.04-spread per share for the first half because of lower recognized allowed ROEs.
Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter reflected the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this quarter's transmission earnings were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. We began recognizing such reserves in the fourth quarter of last year. The net ROE recognized in our second quarter 2015 transmission earnings is comparable with the level incorporated into our first quarter 2015 earnings and 2015 earnings guidance provided in February.
Regarding second quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.75% allowed ROE compared with 9.4% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.6% to 2.95%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.
Finally, depreciation and amortization expenses increased in jurisdictions not subject to formulaic ratemaking, negatively affecting earnings by approximately $0.01 per share.
Moving to factors that had a favorable effect on the second quarter comparison. Increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. And earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective income tax rate, both of which I will discuss further on the next page.
Turning then to Page 13. First, I would like to remind you that we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. In particular a return to normal weather in the third quarter would boost earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to the mild year-ago quarter.
Over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
As I mentioned, we have been recording a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower FERC-allowed ROE since the fourth quarter of last year. The cumulative reserve recorded in that quarter was retroactive to November 12, 2013, the date the first MISO ROE complaint case was filed. The absence in the fourth quarter of this year of the prior period portion of the fourth quarter 2014 reserve is expected to benefit this year's fourth quarter earnings comparison.
Moving to a couple of factors that are anticipated to negatively affect the second half 2015 earnings comparison. Depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to increase for our businesses not operating under formula rates, and capitalized financing causes -- costs are expected to decline, reflecting a year-over-year decline in ongoing Ameren Missouri capital projects. In 2014, a significant number of Ameren Missouri capital projects were in process and ultimately placed into service late in the year.
Back on the positive side, earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%.
In addition, I want to remind you of additional factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016. Further, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision, authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
Turning now to Page 14. I will update you on select pending regulatory matters. Turning first to Illinois. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing with the ICC. Under its formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filings speaks of $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to these presentation.
The ICC staff testimony filed in mid-July recommended a rate update that is just $3 million less than Ameren Illinois' request. Interveners recommended rate update that are $18 million to $19 million less than our request. As noted on this page, significant portions of these interveners' adjustments relate to a position that the ICC has rejected in its past formula rate orders. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year.
Turning now to Page 15. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. As Warner mentioned, earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff, the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case.
This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things. Our original rate request incorporated a 10.25% ROE, while the staff had recommended a 9.31% ROE in their June testimony. For reference, the current allowed ROE for this business is 9.08% effective January of 2014.
Our annual rate increase request is now approximately $45 million after incorporating the stipulation and agreement that I just mentioned. We estimate the ICC staff's June testimony in this case adjusted for the stipulation supports an approximately $44 million rate increase. In addition to the parties to the stipulation, the Illinois Attorney General filed testimony in the case in June, which advocated a number of downward adjustments to our requested revenue requirement, most of them related to operating expenses. However, the Attorney General did not file ROE testimony.
Our filing also included a proposal for a volume-balancing adjustment for residential and small nonresidential customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in an over or under-collection of natural gas revenues for these classes. I'm pleased to report that none of the parties to the case have opposed our request for this volume-balance adjustment mechanism. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Turning now to Page 16. I will update you on some regulatory matters pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As previously mentioned, there are 2 pending complaint cases seeking to reduce the base-allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.
In the first case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended February 11, 2015, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an Administrative Law Judge by the end of this November, with a FERC final order expected sometime in 2016.
In the second case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended December 31 of this year, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an Administrative Law Judge by the middle of next year, with the FERC final order expected in 2017.
Moving then to Page 17. In Missouri, hearings were held last week for our proposed 2016 to 2018 Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan would replace the current one, which has been in effect since 2013 and expires at the end of this year. The new plan would provide net customer benefits of $165 million over 20 years and reflects Ameren Missouri's continued commitment to offering cost-effective and realistically achievable energy efficiency programs for its customers. We expect the Missouri Public Service Commission decision early this fall, and if approved, the plan would be implemented beginning January 1, 2016.
Finally, turning to Page 19. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We delivered second quarter earnings that were solid, and we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
In addition, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investment in jurisdictions with modern constructive ratemaking. As Warner stated, earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018, and we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycles.
That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities we discussed today and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity, given the recent favorable settlement of our 2013 tax return, the strong financial position and our outlook cash flows, certainly bolsters our confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations. When you couple our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which today provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 4.1%, we believe our common stock presents a very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Today, we announced second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with core earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's second quarter. The results reported today, we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 and expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Key drivers of our second quarter core earnings are listed on this page. I will highlight a couple of them, and Marty will discuss each of these drivers later in the call.
Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These incremental investments continue to be targeted towards our electric transmission and delivery businesses that operate under formulaic ratemaking.
However, in the second quarter of 2015, milder weather drove retail electric sales volumes and earnings lower than second quarter 2014 levels. Further, seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition in the formulaic ratemaking in Illinois also negatively affected the comparisons for the quarter and year-to-date periods, but these effects are expected to reverse over the remainder of the year.
Our second quarter 2015 core earnings do exclude 2 unusual items. Those are: results from discontinuing operations, primarily reflecting recognition of a tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position; and a loss provision resulting from discontinuing the pursuit of a construction and operating license for our second nuclear unit in Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. This relates to development costs incurred in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in continuing operations.
While we continue to believe nuclear power must be an important clean energy source for our company and country, as evidenced by the 20-year license extension we received this past March for our Callaway Energy Center, this loss provision was driven by recent changes in vendor support for licensing efforts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our assessment of long-term capacity needs, declining cost of alternative generation technologies and the regulatory framework in Missouri, among other things. Again, Marty will discuss second quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments toward this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this slide. As you can see, we invested $556 million of our $846 million of capital expenditures over the first half of this year in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This represents about 65% of our first half 2015 total capital expenditures and is an 11% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the first half of 2014.
Approximately $300 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects in the first half of this year, driven by ongoing construction work on ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well underway on the first line segment, with more than 80% of the 132 tower structures already erected. Completion of this segment is expected next year.  Further, foundation construction is underway on 2 additional line segments as well as 8 of 10 substations.
In addition, I am pleased to note that in May, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the 7-mile Missouri portion for the Illinois Rivers project.
Turning to ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois. Just last week, Illinois Commerce Commission Administrative Law Judges issued a proposed order recommending approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, and we expect the ICC to issue an order later this year. We also have a pending request at the Missouri Public Service Commission for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the Mark Twain project in Northwestern Missouri and expect a decision early next year. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved, multi-value projects.
With regard to the cases pending at the FERC, challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners continue to strongly advocate for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. Marty will give you more details in a moment, but I would like to point out that first consideration of these cases is expected to extend into 2016 and 2017.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $250 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure project in the first half of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan. This work, enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, is on track to meet or exceed its investments, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals. Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as result of electric grid upgrades.
Since the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches and an upgraded distribution grid resulted in 238,000 fewer annual electric service interruptions on average. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 19% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule.
In 2015, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy 142,000 electric meters at customer locations in Central and Southern Illinois. Also, more than 330 employees and an additional 1,000 contract workers have been hired to support investments in Ameren Illinois' electric system and operations. As a result, we are on track to exceed our full-time equivalent job creation commitment. All of these benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois.
Of course, all of this progress requires timely recovery of our investments and constructive regulatory outcomes. We are clearly focused on achieving positive resolutions for our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case.
While Marty will cover these cases in more detail in a bit later, I will mention that earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, Illinois Commerce Commission staff, Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case. This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things, which compares to the current allowed ROE of 9.08%. We look forward to the ICC's decision in this case later this year.
In Missouri, our efforts are well underway to align operating and capital spending with the electric rate order we received in April as we pursue our goal of earning at/or close to our allowed ROE. We are leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts with the natural attrition we are experiencing with our workforce as well as aggressively pursuing additional cost reductions throughout our supply chain, among other things.
And finally, we are continuing our relentless advocacy efforts of Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders. Our message is simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs. We remain convinced that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those that the State of Illinois is realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole.
Moving to environmental matters. We await the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final Clean Power Plan regulations, which are expected to be issued soon. In recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions with industry leaders, state and federal regulatory and legislative leaders, including policymakers in the White House and the EPA, and other stakeholders. In these discussions, we have aggressively advocated for constructive and responsible improvements for the EPA's proposed plan.
Those improvements include incorporating a better glide path to achieve the final 2030 targets as well as protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. And importantly, we are seeking to protect our customers from a significant rise in electricity costs, while at the same time, making meaningful progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
While I can't predict what will be in the final rules, I am hopeful that the collective advocacy efforts by Ameren and many other like-minded key stakeholders will result in meaningful improvements in the final Clean Power Plan issued by the EPA. In any event, to the EPA's final rules require that we alter and accelerate our transition plans, we fully expect that required investments will be treated fairly by our regulators. Let me assure you that we are committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel-diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion.
Recently, we announced plans for a new solar facility west of St. Louis. The 13-megawatt Montgomery Renewable Energy Center will be the largest investor-owned solar facility in the State of Missouri and 3x the size of our O’Fallon solar facility which went into service last December. The new facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.
One last environmental update. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards or MATS rule. In short, the Supreme Court determined that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the EPA was not required to consider costs when it developed the MATS rule. However, the Supreme Court decision did not vacate the rule. It remains in effect until a further decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. This -- the MATS rule is still in effect. There has been no change in our compliance strategy, and we expect to fully comply with the rule before April of next year. Our most significant capital project to comply with this rule, enhancing the electrostatic precipitators at the Labadie Energy was completed last year. That project was included in our electric rates during our most recent rate case in Missouri.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our previously mentioned strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery services. Such investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, and they deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
Turning now to Page 8. In addition, we have consistently stated that we have a strong pipeline of investments beyond those reflected on the previous page to meet our customers' future electric and gas energy needs and expectations. To that end, in recent months, we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois electric and gas businesses, which would be incremental to those incorporated into the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan just mentioned.
Such investments would be directed to the reconstruction and replacement of aging distribution system infrastructure such as lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities to sustain and improve reliability for our customers. Further, these investments include infrastructure capacity upgrades and additions in higher growth areas of the service territory. 
In Ameren Illinois' natural gas delivery business, incremental capital would be directed to gas transmission line replacements associated with evolving pipeline safety regulations and aging distribution main and service replacement projects.
Finally, in Ameren Illinois' FERC-regulated electric transmission business, identified projects are primarily reliability-related, including compliance with new NERC reliability standards and age-based replacements of equipment. We will evaluate these potential incremental investments over the balance of this year as part of our now normal annual planning process.
As Marty will discuss further, given the strength of our balance sheet and added confidence in the strength of our prospective cash flows resulting from the recent IRS sign-off on our 2013 tax return and associated tax assets, we believe we have the ability to fund the growth plans we announced in February as well as these potential incremental investments without issuing any additional equity.
Turning now to Page 9. In summary, we have a strong long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above-peer average rate base growth that is focused on a transparent mix of utility infrastructure investments and jurisdictions with modern constructive rate-making that is formulaic or uses a future test year.
Earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018. As we said on our May earnings call, we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycle. That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities I just described and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth without issuing an additional equity, certainly bolstered my confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations.
In addition to a superior earnings growth outlook, Ameren offers an attractive annualized dividend of $1.64 per share and a current yield of about 4.1%, which is also superior for our regulated peer average. We remain focused on delivering a solid dividend as we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Of course, any future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
In closing, we believe our shares offer very attractive total return potential for our investors. We are committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we continue to believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Again, thank you for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,306279849,844754,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings. Excluding results from discontinued operations",2257,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings. Excluding results from discontinued operations and a 2015 loss provision for discontinuing pursuit of a license for a second nuclear unit at Callaway, Ameren recorded second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with second quarter 2014 core earnings of $0.62 per share.
Second Quarter 2015 earnings from discontinued operations were $0.21, primarily resulting from recognition of a tax benefit related to resolution of an uncertain tax decision. This tax benefit reflects a settlement reached in June with the IRS, which resolved tax matters associated with the divestiture of our merchant generation business. As Warner mentioned, with this settlement in hand, we have even greater confidence in our ability to fund the growth plan we announced in February as well as the potential incremental investments discussed without issuing any additional equity, including no issuances of equity through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
As of June 30, our combined tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and expected refunds, stand at $643 million, including $454 million at the Ameren parent company level which are expected to offset income tax liabilities into 2017. In addition to excluding discontinued operations, core earnings also excluded the previously mentioned Callaway license-related provision, which was $0.18 per share.
Turning now to Page 12. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.04 per share decline in second quarter 2015 core earnings compared to second quarter 2014 core earnings. Key factors included lower retail electric sales volumes, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. Milder early summer temperatures accounted for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline with the balance due to energy efficiency, partially offset by revenue recovery authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act and lower Missouri industrial sales stemming primarily from a prolonged reduction in consumption by Ameren Missouri's largest customer, Noranda Aluminum. 
Second quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the warmer-than-normal early summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers in Illinois increased almost 0.5%. And in Missouri, they decreased about 0.75%. As mentioned, in Missouri, the negative earnings effect of decline in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is compensated for under provisions of the utility's energy efficiency plan. Excluding the estimated effects of these Missouri programs, we estimate that sales to residential and commercial customers would have also increased by almost 0.5%.
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and the aforementioned lower sales to Noranda Aluminum.
As noted on this page, the second quarter earnings comparison was also negatively affected by $0.02 per share by a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois electric delivery. These same factors reduced first half 2015 earnings by $0.04 per share compared to the prior year period, but we expect they will reverse by year end.
In addition, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois was reduced by $0.02 per share for the quarter and $0.04-spread per share for the first half because of lower recognized allowed ROEs.
Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter reflected the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this quarter's transmission earnings were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. We began recognizing such reserves in the fourth quarter of last year. The net ROE recognized in our second quarter 2015 transmission earnings is comparable with the level incorporated into our first quarter 2015 earnings and 2015 earnings guidance provided in February.
Regarding second quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.75% allowed ROE compared with 9.4% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.6% to 2.95%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.
Finally, depreciation and amortization expenses increased in jurisdictions not subject to formulaic ratemaking, negatively affecting earnings by approximately $0.01 per share.
Moving to factors that had a favorable effect on the second quarter comparison. Increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. And earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective income tax rate, both of which I will discuss further on the next page.
Turning then to Page 13. First, I would like to remind you that we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. In particular a return to normal weather in the third quarter would boost earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to the mild year-ago quarter.
Over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
As I mentioned, we have been recording a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower FERC-allowed ROE since the fourth quarter of last year. The cumulative reserve recorded in that quarter was retroactive to November 12, 2013, the date the first MISO ROE complaint case was filed. The absence in the fourth quarter of this year of the prior period portion of the fourth quarter 2014 reserve is expected to benefit this year's fourth quarter earnings comparison.
Moving to a couple of factors that are anticipated to negatively affect the second half 2015 earnings comparison. Depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to increase for our businesses not operating under formula rates, and capitalized financing causes -- costs are expected to decline, reflecting a year-over-year decline in ongoing Ameren Missouri capital projects. In 2014, a significant number of Ameren Missouri capital projects were in process and ultimately placed into service late in the year.
Back on the positive side, earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%.
In addition, I want to remind you of additional factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016. Further, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision, authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
Turning now to Page 14. I will update you on select pending regulatory matters. Turning first to Illinois. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing with the ICC. Under its formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filings speaks of $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The ICC staff testimony filed in mid-July recommended a rate update that is just $3 million less than Ameren Illinois' request. Interveners recommended rate update that are $18 million to $19 million less than our request. As noted on this page, significant portions of these interveners' adjustments relate to a position that the ICC has rejected in its past formula rate orders. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year.
Turning now to Page 15. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. As Warner mentioned, earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff, the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case.
This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things. Our original rate request incorporated a 10.25% ROE, while the staff had recommended a 9.31% ROE in their June testimony. For reference, the current allowed ROE for this business is 9.08% effective January of 2014.
Our annual rate increase request is now approximately $45 million after incorporating the stipulation and agreement that I just mentioned. We estimate the ICC staff's June testimony in this case adjusted for the stipulation supports an approximately $44 million rate increase. In addition to the parties to the stipulation, the Illinois Attorney General filed testimony in the case in June, which advocated a number of downward adjustments to our requested revenue requirement, most of them related to operating expenses. However, the Attorney General did not file ROE testimony.
Our filing also included a proposal for a volume-balancing adjustment for residential and small nonresidential customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in an over or under-collection of natural gas revenues for these classes. I'm pleased to report that none of the parties to the case have opposed our request for this volume-balance adjustment mechanism. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Turning now to Page 16. I will update you on some regulatory matters pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As previously mentioned, there are 2 pending complaint cases seeking to reduce the base-allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.
In the first case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended February 11, 2015, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an Administrative Law Judge by the end of this November, with a FERC final order expected sometime in 2016.
In the second case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended December 31 of this year, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an Administrative Law Judge by the middle of next year, with the FERC final order expected in 2017.
Moving then to Page 17. In Missouri, hearings were held last week for our proposed 2016 to 2018 Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan would replace the current one, which has been in effect since 2013 and expires at the end of this year. The new plan would provide net customer benefits of $165 million over 20 years and reflects Ameren Missouri's continued commitment to offering cost-effective and realistically achievable energy efficiency programs for its customers. We expect the Missouri Public Service Commission decision early this fall, and if approved, the plan would be implemented beginning January 1, 2016.
Finally, turning to Page 19. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We delivered second quarter earnings that were solid, and we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
In addition, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investment in jurisdictions with modern constructive ratemaking. As Warner stated, earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018, and we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycles.
That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities we discussed today and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity, given the recent favorable settlement of our 2013 tax return, the strong financial position and our outlook for cash flows, certainly bolsters our confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations. When you couple our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which today provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 4.1%, we believe our common stock presents a very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Today, we announced second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with core earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's second quarter. The results reported today, we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 and expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Key drivers of our second quarter core earnings are listed on this page. I will highlight a couple of them, and Marty will discuss each of these drivers later in the call.
Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These incremental investments continue to be targeted towards our electric transmission and delivery businesses that operate under formulaic ratemaking.
However, in the second quarter of 2015, milder weather drove retail electric sales volumes and earnings lower than second quarter 2014 levels. Further, seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition in the formulaic ratemaking in Illinois also negatively affected the comparisons for the quarter and year-to-date periods, but these effects are expected to reverse over the remainder of the year.
Our second quarter 2015 core earnings do exclude 2 unusual items. Those are: results from discontinuing operations, primarily reflecting recognition of a tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position; and a loss provision resulting from discontinuing the pursuit of a construction and operating license for our second nuclear unit in Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. This relates to development costs incurred in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in continuing operations.
While we continue to believe nuclear power must be an important clean energy source for our company and country, as evidenced by the 20-year license extension we received this past March for our Callaway Energy Center, this loss provision was driven by recent changes in vendor support for licensing efforts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our assessment of long-term capacity needs, declining cost of alternative generation technologies and the regulatory framework in Missouri, among other things. Again, Marty will discuss second quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments toward this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this slide. As you can see, we invested $556 million of our $846 million of capital expenditures over the first half of this year in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This represents about 65% of our first half 2015 total capital expenditures and is an 11% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the first half of 2014.
Approximately $300 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects in the first half of this year, driven by ongoing construction work on ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well underway on the first line segment, with more than 80% of the 132 tower structures already erected. Completion of this segment is expected next year.  Further, foundation construction is underway on 2 additional line segments as well as 8 of 10 substations.
In addition, I am pleased to note that in May, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the 7-mile Missouri portion for the Illinois Rivers project.
Turning to ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois. Just last week, Illinois Commerce Commission Administrative Law Judges issued a proposed order recommending approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, and we expect the ICC to issue an order later this year. We also have a pending request at the Missouri Public Service Commission for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the Mark Twain project in Northwestern Missouri and expect a decision early next year. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved, multi-value projects.
With regard to the cases pending at the FERC, challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners continue to strongly advocate for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. Marty will give you more details in a moment, but I would like to point out that first consideration of these cases is expected to extend into 2016 and 2017.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $250 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure project in the first half of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan. This work, enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, is on track to meet or exceed its investments, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals. Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as result of electric grid upgrades.
Since the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches and an upgraded distribution grid resulted in 238,000 fewer annual electric service interruptions on average. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 19% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule.
In 2015, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy 142,000 electric meters at customer locations in Central and Southern Illinois. Also, more than 330 employees and an additional 1,000 contract workers have been hired to support investments in Ameren Illinois' electric system and operations. As a result, we are on track to exceed our full-time equivalent job creation commitment. All of these benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois.
Of course, all of this progress requires timely recovery of our investments and constructive regulatory outcomes. We are clearly focused on achieving positive resolutions for our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case.
While Marty will cover these cases in more detail in a bit later, I will mention that earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, Illinois Commerce Commission staff, Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case. This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things, which compares to the current allowed ROE of 9.08%. We look forward to the ICC's decision in this case later this year.
In Missouri, our efforts are well underway to align operating and capital spending with the electric rate order we received in April as we pursue our goal of earning at/or close to our allowed ROE. We are leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts with the natural attrition we are experiencing with our workforce as well as aggressively pursuing additional cost reductions throughout our supply chain, among other things.
And finally, we are continuing our relentless advocacy efforts of Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders. Our message is simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs. We remain convinced that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those that the State of Illinois is realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole.
Moving to environmental matters. We await the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final Clean Power Plan regulations, which are expected to be issued soon. In recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions with industry leaders, state and federal regulatory and legislative leaders, including policymakers in the White House and the EPA, and other stakeholders. In these discussions, we have aggressively advocated for constructive and responsible improvements for the EPA's proposed plan.
Those improvements include incorporating a better glide path to achieve the final 2030 targets as well as protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. And importantly, we are seeking to protect our customers from a significant rise in electricity costs, while at the same time, making meaningful progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
While I can't predict what will be in the final rules, I am hopeful that the collective advocacy efforts by Ameren and many other like-minded key stakeholders will result in meaningful improvements in the final Clean Power Plan issued by the EPA. In any event, to the EPA's final rules require that we alter and accelerate our transition plans, we fully expect that required investments will be treated fairly by our regulators. Let me assure you that we are committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel-diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion.
Recently, we announced plans for a new solar facility west of St. Louis. The 13-megawatt Montgomery Renewable Energy Center will be the largest investor-owned solar facility in the State of Missouri and 3x the size of our O’Fallon solar facility which went into service last December. The new facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.
One last environmental update. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards or MATS rule. In short, the Supreme Court determined that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the EPA was not required to consider costs when it developed the MATS rule. However, the Supreme Court decision did not vacate the rule. It remains in effect until a further decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. This -- the MATS rule is still in effect. There has been no change in our compliance strategy, and we expect to fully comply with the rule before April of next year. Our most significant capital project to comply with this rule, enhancing the electrostatic precipitators at the Labadie Energy was completed last year. That project was included in our electric rates during our most recent rate case in Missouri.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our previously mentioned strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery services. Such investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, and they deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
Turning now to Page 8. In addition, we have consistently stated that we have a strong pipeline of investments beyond those reflected on the previous page to meet our customers' future electric and gas energy needs and expectations. To that end, in recent months, we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois electric and gas businesses, which would be incremental to those incorporated into the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan just mentioned.
Such investments would be directed to the reconstruction and replacement of aging distribution system infrastructure such as lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities to sustain and improve reliability for our customers. Further, these investments include infrastructure capacity upgrades and additions in higher growth areas of the service territory. 
In Ameren Illinois' natural gas delivery business, incremental capital would be directed to gas transmission line replacements associated with evolving pipeline safety regulations and aging distribution main and service replacement projects.
Finally, in Ameren Illinois' FERC-regulated electric transmission business, identified projects are primarily reliability-related, including compliance with new NERC reliability standards and age-based replacements of equipment. We will evaluate these potential incremental investments over the balance of this year as part of our now normal annual planning process.
As Marty will discuss further, given the strength of our balance sheet and added confidence in the strength of our prospective cash flows resulting from the recent IRS sign-off on our 2013 tax return and associated tax assets, we believe we have the ability to fund the growth plans we announced in February as well as these potential incremental investments without issuing any additional equity.
Turning now to Page 9. In summary, we have a strong long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above-peer average rate base growth that is focused on a transparent mix of utility infrastructure investments and jurisdictions with modern constructive rate-making that is formulaic or uses a future test year.
Earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018. As we said on our May earnings call, we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycle. That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities I just described and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth without issuing an additional equity, certainly bolstered my confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations.
In addition to a superior earnings growth outlook, Ameren offers an attractive annualized dividend of $1.64 per share and a current yield of about 4.1%, which is also superior for our regulated peer average. We remain focused on delivering a solid dividend as we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Of course, any future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
In closing, we believe our shares offer very attractive total return potential for our investors. We are committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we continue to believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Again, thank you for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,306279849,845713,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings. Excluding results from discontinued operations",2257,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings. Excluding results from discontinued operations and a 2015 loss provision for discontinuing pursuit of a license for a second nuclear unit at Callaway, Ameren recorded second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with second quarter 2014 core earnings of $0.62 per share.
Second Quarter 2015 earnings from discontinued operations were $0.21, primarily resulting from recognition of a tax benefit related to resolution of an uncertain tax decision. This tax benefit reflects a settlement reached in June with the IRS, which resolved tax matters associated with the divestiture of our merchant generation business. As Warner mentioned, with this settlement in hand, we have even greater confidence in our ability to fund the growth plan we announced in February as well as the potential incremental investments discussed without issuing any additional equity, including no issuances of equity through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
As of June 30, our combined tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and expected refunds, stand at $643 million, including $454 million at the Ameren parent company level which are expected to offset income tax liabilities into 2017. In addition to excluding discontinued operations, core earnings also excluded the previously mentioned Callaway license-related provision, which was $0.18 per share.
Turning now to Page 12. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.04 per share decline in second quarter 2015 core earnings compared to second quarter 2014 core earnings. Key factors included lower retail electric sales volumes, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. Milder early summer temperatures accounted for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline with the balance due to energy efficiency, partially offset by revenue recovery authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act and lower Missouri industrial sales stemming primarily from a prolonged reduction in consumption by Ameren Missouri's largest customer, Noranda Aluminum. 
Second quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the warmer-than-normal early summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers in Illinois increased almost 0.5%. And in Missouri, they decreased about 0.75%. As mentioned, in Missouri, the negative earnings effect of decline in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is compensated for under provisions of the utility's energy efficiency plan. Excluding the estimated effects of these Missouri programs, we estimate that sales to residential and commercial customers would have also increased by almost 0.5%.
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and the aforementioned lower sales to Noranda Aluminum.
As noted on this page, the second quarter earnings comparison was also negatively affected by $0.02 per share by a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois electric delivery. These same factors reduced first half 2015 earnings by $0.04 per share compared to the prior year period, but we expect they will reverse by year end.
In addition, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois was reduced by $0.02 per share for the quarter and $0.04-spread per share for the first half because of lower recognized allowed ROEs.
Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter reflected the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this quarter's transmission earnings were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. We began recognizing such reserves in the fourth quarter of last year. The net ROE recognized in our second quarter 2015 transmission earnings is comparable with the level incorporated into our first quarter 2015 earnings and 2015 earnings guidance provided in February.
Regarding second quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.75% allowed ROE compared with 9.4% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.6% to 2.95%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.
Finally, depreciation and amortization expenses increased in jurisdictions not subject to formulaic ratemaking, negatively affecting earnings by approximately $0.01 per share.
Moving to factors that had a favorable effect on the second quarter comparison. Increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. And earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective income tax rate, both of which I will discuss further on the next page.
Turning then to Page 13. First, I would like to remind you that we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. In particular a return to normal weather in the third quarter would boost earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to the mild year-ago quarter.
Over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
As I mentioned, we have been recording a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower FERC-allowed ROE since the fourth quarter of last year. The cumulative reserve recorded in that quarter was retroactive to November 12, 2013, the date the first MISO ROE complaint case was filed. The absence in the fourth quarter of this year of the prior period portion of the fourth quarter 2014 reserve is expected to benefit this year's fourth quarter earnings comparison.
Moving to a couple of factors that are anticipated to negatively affect the second half 2015 earnings comparison. Depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to increase for our businesses not operating under formula rates, and capitalized financing causes -- costs are expected to decline, reflecting a year-over-year decline in ongoing Ameren Missouri capital projects. In 2014, a significant number of Ameren Missouri capital projects were in process and ultimately placed into service late in the year.
Back on the positive side, earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%.
In addition, I want to remind you of additional factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016. Further, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision, authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
Turning now to Page 14. I will update you on select pending regulatory matters. Turning first to Illinois. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing with the ICC. Under its formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filings speaks of $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The ICC staff testimony filed in mid-July recommended a rate update that is just $3 million less than Ameren Illinois' request. Interveners recommended rate update that are $18 million to $19 million less than our request. As noted on this page, significant portions of these interveners' adjustments relate to a position that the ICC has rejected in its past formula rate orders. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year.
Turning now to Page 15. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. As Warner mentioned, earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff, the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case.
This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things. Our original rate request incorporated a 10.25% ROE, while the staff had recommended a 9.31% ROE in their June testimony. For reference, the current allowed ROE for this business is 9.08% effective January of 2014.
Our annual rate increase request is now approximately $45 million after incorporating the stipulation and agreement that I just mentioned. We estimate the ICC staff's June testimony in this case adjusted for the stipulation supports an approximately $44 million rate increase. In addition to the parties to the stipulation, the Illinois Attorney General filed testimony in the case in June, which advocated a number of downward adjustments to our requested revenue requirement, most of them related to operating expenses. However, the Attorney General did not file ROE testimony.
Our filing also included a proposal for a volume-balancing adjustment for residential and small nonresidential customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in an over or under-collection of natural gas revenues for these classes. I'm pleased to report that none of the parties to the case have opposed our request for this volume-balance adjustment mechanism. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Turning now to Page 16. I will update you on some regulatory matters pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As previously mentioned, there are 2 pending complaint cases seeking to reduce the base-allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.
In the first case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended February 11, 2015, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an Administrative Law Judge by the end of this November, with a FERC final order expected sometime in 2016.
In the second case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended December 31 of this year, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an Administrative Law Judge by the middle of next year, with the FERC final order expected in 2017.
Moving then to Page 17. In Missouri, hearings were held last week for our proposed 2016 to 2018 Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan would replace the current one, which has been in effect since 2013 and expires at the end of this year. The new plan would provide net customer benefits of $165 million over 20 years and reflects Ameren Missouri's continued commitment to offering cost-effective and realistically achievable energy efficiency programs for its customers. We expect the Missouri Public Service Commission decision early this fall, and if approved, the plan would be implemented beginning January 1, 2016.
Finally, turning to Page 19. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We delivered second quarter earnings that were solid, and we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
In addition, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investment in jurisdictions with modern constructive ratemaking. As Warner stated, earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018, and we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycles.
That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities we discussed today and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity, given the recent favorable settlement of our 2013 tax return, the strong financial position and our outlook for cash flows, certainly bolsters our confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations. When you couple our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which today provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 4.1%, we believe our common stock presents a very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Today, we announced second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with core earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's second quarter. The results reported today, we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2015 and expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Key drivers of our second quarter core earnings are listed on this page. I will highlight a couple of them, and Marty will discuss each of these drivers later in the call.
Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are benefiting from the significant investments we're making to better serve our customers. These incremental investments continue to be targeted towards our electric transmission and delivery businesses that operate under formulaic ratemaking.
However, in the second quarter of 2015, milder weather drove retail electric sales volumes and earnings lower than second quarter 2014 levels. Further, seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition in the formulaic ratemaking in Illinois also negatively affected the comparisons for the quarter and year-to-date periods, but these effects are expected to reverse over the remainder of the year.
Our second quarter 2015 core earnings do exclude 2 unusual items. Those are results from discontinuing operations, primarily reflecting recognition of a tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position; and a loss provision resulting from discontinuing the pursuit of a construction and operating license for our second nuclear unit in Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. This relates to development costs incurred in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in continuing operations.
While we continue to believe nuclear power must be an important clean energy source for our company and country, as evidenced by the 20-year license extension we received this past March for our Callaway Energy Center, this loss provision was driven by recent changes in vendor support for licensing efforts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our assessment of long-term capacity needs, declining cost of alternative generation technologies and the regulatory framework in Missouri, among other things. Again, Marty will discuss second quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments toward this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this slide. As you can see, we invested $556 million of our $846 million of capital expenditures for the first half of this year in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This represents about 65% of our first half 2015 total capital expenditures and is an 11% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the first half of 2014.
Approximately $300 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects in the first half of this year, driven by ongoing construction work on ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well underway on the first line segment, with more than 80% of the 132 tower structures already erected. Completion of this segment is expected next year.  Further, foundation construction is underway on 2 additional line segments as well as 8 of 10 substations.
In addition, I am pleased to note that in May, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a certificate of convenience and necessity for the 7-mile Missouri portion for the Illinois Rivers project.
Turning to ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois. Just last week, Illinois Commerce Commission administrative law judges issued a proposed order recommending approval of a certificate of convenience and necessity, and we expect the ICC to issue an order later this year. We also have a pending request at the Missouri Public Service Commission for certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain project in Northwestern Missouri and expect a decision early next year. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved, multi-value projects.
With regard to the cases pending at the FERC, challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners continue to strongly advocate for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. Marty will give you more details in a moment, but I would like to point out that first consideration of these cases is expected to extend into 2016 and 2017.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $250 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure project in the first half of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' Modernization Action Plan. This work, enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, is on track to meet or exceed its investments, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades.
Since the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches and an upgraded distribution grid resulted in 238,000 fewer annual electric service interruptions on average. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 19% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule.
In 2015, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy 142,000 electric meters at customer locations in Central and Southern Illinois. Also, more than 330 employees and an additional 1,000 contract workers have been hired to support investments in Ameren Illinois' electric system and operations. As a result, we are on track to exceed our full-time equivalent job creation commitment. All of these benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois.
Of course, all of this progress requires timely recovery of our investments and constructive regulatory outcomes. We are clearly focused on achieving positive resolutions for our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case.
While Marty will cover these cases in more detail in a bit later, I will mention that earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, Illinois Commerce Commission staff, the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case. This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things, which compares to the current allowed ROE of 9.08%. We look forward to the ICC's decision in this case later this year.
In Missouri, our efforts are well underway to align operating and capital spending with the electric rate order we received in April as we pursue our goal of earning at or close to our allowed ROE. We are leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts with the natural attrition we are experiencing with our workforce as well as aggressively pursuing additional cost reductions throughout our supply chain, among other things.
And finally, we're continuing a relentless advocacy efforts of Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders. Our message is simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs. We remain convinced that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those that the State of Illinois is realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole.
Moving to environmental matters. We await the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final Clean Power Plan regulations, which are expected to be issued soon. In recent months, we've engaged in extensive discussions with industry leaders, state and federal regulatory and legislative leaders, including policymakers in the White House and the EPA and other stakeholders. In these discussions, we have aggressively advocated for constructive and responsible improvements for the EPA's proposed plan.
Those improvements include incorporating a better glide path to achieve the final 2030 targets as well as protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. And importantly, we are seeking to protect our customers from a significant rise in electricity costs, while at the same time making meaningful progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
While I can't predict what will be in the final rules, I am hopeful that the collective advocacy efforts by Ameren and many other like-minded key stakeholders will result in meaningful improvements in the final Clean Power Plan issued by the EPA. In any event, should the EPA's final rules require that we alter and accelerate our transition plans, we fully expect that required investments will be treated fairly by our regulators. Let me assure you that we're committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel-diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion.
Recently, we announced plans for a new solar facility west of St. Louis. The 13-megawatt Montgomery Renewable Energy Center will be the largest investor-owned solar facility in the State of Missouri and 3x the size of our O’Fallon solar facility which went into service last December. The new facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.
One last environmental update. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS rule. In short, the Supreme Court determined that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the EPA was not required to consider costs when it developed the MATS rule. However, the Supreme Court decision did not vacate the rule. It remains in effect until a further decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. This, the MATS rule, is still in effect. There has been no change in our compliance strategy. We expect to fully comply with the rule before April of next year. Our most significant capital project to comply with this rule, enhancing the electrostatic precipitators at the Labadie Energy was completed last year. That project was included in our electric rates during our most recent rate case in Missouri.
Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our previously mentioned strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital at FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery services. Such investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, and they deliver long-term benefits to our customers.
Turning now to Page 8. In addition, we have consistently stated that we have a strong pipeline of investments beyond those reflected on the previous page to meet our customers' future electric and gas energy needs and expectations. To that end, in recent months, we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois electric and gas businesses, which would be incremental to those incorporated into the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan just mentioned.
Such investments would be directed to the reconstruction and replacement of aging distribution system infrastructure such as lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities to sustain and improve reliability for our customers. Further, these investments include infrastructure capacity upgrades and additions in higher growth areas of the service territory. 
In Ameren Illinois' natural gas delivery business, incremental capital would be directed to gas transmission line replacements associated with evolving pipeline safety regulations and aging distribution main and service replacement projects.
Finally, in Ameren Illinois' FERC-regulated electric transmission business, identified projects are primarily reliability-related, including compliance with new NERC reliability standards and age-based replacements of equipment. We will evaluate these potential incremental investments over the balance of this year as part of our now normal annual planning process.
As Marty will discuss further, given the strength of our balance sheet and added confidence in the strength of our prospective cash flows resulting from the recent IRS sign-off on our 2013 tax return and associated tax assets, we believe we have the ability to fund the growth plans we announced in February as well as these potential incremental investments without issuing any additional equity.
Turning now to Page 9. In summary, we have a strong long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above-peer average rate base growth that is focused on a transparent mix of utility infrastructure investments in jurisdictions with modern constructive ratemaking that's formulaic or uses a future test year.
Earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018. As we said on our May earnings call, we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycle. That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities I just described and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth without issuing any additional equity certainly bolstered my confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations.
In addition to a superior earnings growth outlook, Ameren offers an attractive annualized dividend of $1.64 per share and a current yield of about 4.1%, which is also superior for our regulated peer average. We remain focused on delivering a solid dividend as we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Of course, any future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
In closing, we believe our shares offer very attractive total return potential for our investors. We're committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we continue to believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Again, thank you for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earning. Excluding results from discontinued operations",2263,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched second quarter 2014 GAAP earning. Excluding results from discontinued operations and a 2015 loss provision for discontinuing pursuit of a license for a second nuclear unit at Callaway, Ameren recorded second quarter 2015 core earnings of $0.58 per share compared with second quarter 2014 core earnings of $0.62 per share.
Second quarter 2015 earnings from discontinued operations were $0.21, primarily resulting from recognition of a tax benefit related to resolution of an uncertain tax position. This tax benefit reflects a settlement reached in June with the IRS, which resolved tax matters associated with the divestiture of our merchant generation business. As Warner mentioned, with this settlement in hand, we have even greater confidence in our ability to fund the growth plan we announced in February as well as the potential incremental investments discussed without issuing any additional equity, including no issuances of equity through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
As of June 30, our combined tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and expected refunds stand at $643 million, including $454 million at the Ameren parent company level, which are expected to offset income tax liabilities into 2017. In addition to excluding discontinued operations, core earnings also excluded the previously mentioned Callaway license-related provision, which was $0.18 per share.
Turning now to Page 12. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.04 per share decline in second quarter 2015 core earnings compared to second quarter 2014 core earnings. Key factors included lower retail electric sales volumes, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. Milder early summer temperatures accounted for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline with the balance due to energy efficiency, partially offset by revenue recovery authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act and lower Missouri industrial sales stemming primarily from a prolonged reduction in consumption by Ameren Missouri's largest customer, Noranda Aluminum. 
Second quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the warmer-than-normal early summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers in Illinois increased almost 0.5%. And in Missouri, they decreased about 0.75%. As mentioned, in Missouri, the negative earnings effect of decline in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is compensated for under provisions of the utility's energy efficiency plan. Excluding the estimated effects of these Missouri programs, we estimate that sales to residential and commercial customers would have also increased by almost 0.5%.
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and the aforementioned lower sales to Noranda Aluminum.
As noted on this page, the second quarter earnings comparison was also negatively affected by $0.02 per share by a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois electric delivery. These same factors reduced first half 2015 earnings by $0.04 per share compared to the prior year period, but we expect they will reverse by year-end.
In addition, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois was reduced by $0.02 per share for the quarter and $0.04 spread per share for the first half because of lower recognized allowed ROEs.
Transmission earnings for the year ago quarter reflected the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this quarter's transmission earnings were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. We began recognizing such reserves in the fourth quarter of last year. The net ROE recognized in our second quarter 2015 transmission earnings is comparable with the level incorporated into our first quarter 2015 earnings and 2015 earnings guidance provided in February.
Regarding second quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.75% allowed ROE compared with 9.4% in the year ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.6% to 2.95%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.
Finally, depreciation and amortization expenses increased in jurisdictions not subject to formulaic ratemaking, negatively affecting earnings by approximately $0.01 per share.
Moving to factors that had a favorable effect on the second quarter earnings comparison. Increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the year ago quarter. And earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective income tax rate, both of which I will discuss further on the next page.
Turning then to Page 13. First, I would like to remind you that we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. In particular, a return to normal weather in the third quarter would boost earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to the mild year ago quarter.
Over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
As I mentioned, we have been recording a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower FERC-allowed ROE since the fourth quarter of last year. The cumulative reserve recorded in that quarter was retroactive to November 12, 2013, the date the first MISO ROE complaint case was filed. The absence in the fourth quarter of this year of the prior period portion of the fourth quarter 2014 reserve is expected to benefit this year's fourth quarter earnings comparison.
Moving to a couple of factors that are anticipated to negatively affect the second half 2015 earnings comparison. Depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to increase for our businesses not operating under formula rates, and capitalized financing causes -- costs are expected to decline, reflecting a year-over-year decline in ongoing Ameren Missouri capital projects. In 2014, a significant number of Ameren Missouri capital projects were in process and ultimately placed into service late in the year.
Back on the positive side, earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%.
In addition, I want to remind you of additional factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016. Further, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
Turning now to Page 14. I will update you on select pending regulatory matters. Turning first to Illinois. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing with the ICC. Under its formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filings speaks of $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The ICC staff testimony filed in mid-July recommended a rate update that is just $3 million less than Ameren Illinois' request. Interveners recommended rate updates that are $18 million to $19 million less than our request. As noted on this page, significant portions of these interveners' adjustments relate to a position that the ICC has rejected in its past formula rate orders. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year.
Turning now to Page 15. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. As Warner mentioned, earlier this week, Ameren Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff, the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a stipulation and agreement on issues in our pending natural gas delivery case.
This agreement includes a 9.6% ROE, among other things. Our original rate request incorporated a 10.25% ROE, while the staff had recommended a 9.31% ROE in their June testimony. For reference, the current allowed ROE for this business is 9.08% effective January of 2014.
Our annual rate increase request is now approximately $45 million after incorporating the stipulation and agreement that I just mentioned. We estimate the ICC staff's June testimony in this case adjusted for the stipulation supports an approximately $44 million rate increase. In addition to the parties to the stipulation, the Illinois Attorney General filed testimony in the case in June, which advocated a number of downward adjustments to our requested revenue requirement, most of them related to operating expenses. However, the Attorney General did not file ROE testimony.
Our filing also included a proposal for a volume-balancing adjustment for residential and small nonresidential customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in an over or under-collection of natural gas revenues for these classes. I'm pleased to report that none of the parties to the case have opposed our request for this volume-balance adjustment mechanism. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.
Turning now to Page 16. I will update you on some regulatory matters pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As previously mentioned, there are 2 pending complaint cases seeking to reduce the base-allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.
In the first case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended February 11, 2015, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an administrative law judge by the end of this November, with a FERC final order expected sometime in 2016.
In the second case, the ROE decision is expected to be based on market data for the 6 months ended December 31 of this year, and the schedule calls for an initial decision from an administrative law judge by the middle of next year, with the FERC final order expected in 2017.
Moving then to Page 17. In Missouri, hearings were held last week for our proposed 2016 to 2018 Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan would replace the current one, which has been in effect since 2013 and expires at the end of this year. The new plan would provide net customer benefits of $165 million over 20 years and reflects Ameren Missouri's continued commitment to offering cost-effective and realistically achievable energy efficiency programs for its customers. We expect the Missouri Public Service Commission decision early this fall, and if approved, the plan would be implemented beginning January 1, 2016.
Finally, turning to Page 19. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We delivered second quarter earnings that were solid, and we expect our 2015 core diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
In addition, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investment in jurisdictions with modern constructive ratemaking. As Warner stated, earlier this year, we reiterated our expectations for compound annual growth of 7% to 10% in earnings per share from continuing operations over the period 2013 through 2018, and we plan to formally update our long-term earnings growth expectations on an annual basis consistent with our planning cycles.
That said, the $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment opportunities we discussed today and our added conviction concerning the ability to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity, given the recent favorable settlement of our 2013 tax return, the strong financial position and our outlook for cash flows, certainly bolsters our confidence in our ability to achieve earnings growth within those expectations. When you couple our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which today provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 4.1%, we believe our common stock presents a very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced solid third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share in the prior period. The earnings advance reflected retail electric sale",2181,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced solid third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share in the prior period. The earnings advance reflected retail electric sales volumes resulting from warmer summer temperatures that were a near normal for the quarter. 
The warmer weather raised earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared with 2014. Consistent with our strategic plan, you'll hear our earnings comparisons are also benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These investments continue to be weighted toward our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses that operate under framework supportive of infrastructure investment. Further, the seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition in the formula ratemaking for our Illinois electric delivery business positively affected the comparisons for the quarter, as did a lower effective income tax rate. 
These positive variances were offset, in part, by a lower recognized allowed ROEs for our electric transmission and delivery businesses, regulated by the FERC and ICC. I am also pleased to report what our core earnings were $2.44 per share for the first 9 months of 2015, which reflects a strong increase from $2.21 per share for the year-ago period. These results excludes certain items we discussed with you during our second quarter conference call. 
Based on these solid results, today, we also narrowed our 2015 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.55 and $2.65 per share, which is at the upper half of our prior core earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. 
Turning now to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. Simply put, the execution of this strategy delivered solid results to shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. Overall, I am very pleased with our team's performance through September as we continue to deliver solid value to our customers across all of our businesses. 
In particular, we continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks to enhance reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage, among other things. 
As you can see, we invested $886 million or about 2/3 of our $1.3 billion of year-to-date capital expenditures in jurisdictions with these modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. This was a 17% increase for the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the same period last year. 
Approximately $475 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including the ongoing construction of ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well along on the first of 9 line segments of this project with wires being strung across all 132 erected pole structures. Further, foundation work is underway on 3 additional line segments as this construction of all 10 sub-seasonal debt [ph] in September, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity for approximately $150 million Spoon River project.  We are now proceeding with Waterboy acquisition and construction in this project is expected to begin late next year. 
We also have a request pending at the Missouri Public Service Commission for certificate of public convenience and necessity for the approximately $225 million Mark 20 project in northeastern Missouri and we expect the decision early next year. 
All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO approved.
[Audio Gap]
indications pending at the FERC challenging MISOs base-allowed ROE of 12.38% for elective transmission services. We expect the first FERC administrative law judge to issue an initial decision in the first of 2 complaint cases later this month. However, the final FERC orders would not be expected until 2016 in the first case, and 2017 in the second case. 
We continue to advocate for an ROE level that is fair and one that will incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. 
Turning to Page 7 of my presentation, let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. Here, we invested approximately $410 million in electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first 9 months of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' Modernization Action Plan. This work, enabled by the stage Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, continues to provide significant value to our customers and the states of Illinois. 
Notably, our work remains on track to meet or exceed the investments, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals of the act. We have also been focused on achieving positive resolutions of our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case. 
Earlier this week, we received a constructive proposed order from the administrative law judges in our natural gas delivery case. In a few weeks, we expect an order from the ALJ in our electric delivery case, where the differences between the parties have been narrowed to $4 million or less. 
At the end of the day, based on the progress to date between the parties and both of these cases, we are optimistic that we will receive constructive decisions from the ICC in December. 
Moving to Missouri electric service, here, the regulatory framework is not as constructive as those of FERC or Illinois. Nonetheless, it is our goal to earn at or close to our allowed rate of return in all our jurisdictions. Of course, this objective is more challenging in Missouri given the use of historical test year and the regulatory approval process, among other things. 
As we have done in the past, we are working hard to mitigate this slide by leveraging ongoing, enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts while aggressively pursuing cost reductions throughout our operating and support organizations. 
And when necessary, we will seek adjustments to our Missouri rates to address regulatory lag and to earn a fair return on the investments we are making for the benefit of our customers. One area where Missouri had historically been a leader in terms of a constructive framework was energy efficiency. Since 2013, Ameren Missouri has been executing on a comprehensive 3-year energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act, or MEIA. The MEIA has provided electric utilities with the appropriate incentives to make investments in energy efficiency for the benefit of our customers. I am pleased to say that Ameren Missouri's first 3-year plan has been even more successful than we anticipated, which has resulted in substantial benefits for our customers. 
Earlier this year, we had filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which starts to extend these energy efficiency programs for another 3 years, utilizing a similar structure as well as incorporating best practices learned from our first program. 
Unfortunately, last month, the Missouri commission issued an order rejecting our proposed plan. This is disappointing because we believe our proposal provided clear benefits to customers while balancing the interest of shareholders. Under MEIA, proposing an energy efficiency plan is voluntary, and we are evaluating our next steps. 
Finally, I should note, we continue our relentless advocacy efforts for the Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders to enhance same system regulatory framework to address regulatory lag and support investments. While we continue to make appropriate investments in Missouri to ensure safe and adequate service, Missouri is falling behind other states in modernizing its energy policies and energy infrastructure. That is why we continue to relentlessly advocate for better policies to support investment in Missouri. Our message to Missouri policymakers and stakeholders remains simple and straightforward: modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments to upgrade aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs. 
We continue to communicate that such modernization will give benefits similar to those to the state of Illinois that many other states of the country are realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole. And while no final decisions have been made, we continue to look very closely at potential legislative solutions to address this matter during the upcoming 2016 legislative session. 
Turning now to Page 8, now our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate, and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital to FERC-regulated electric transmission in Illinois Electric and natural gas delivery services because these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and investment benefits to all of our customers. 
To that end, on our second quarter call, we noted that we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses, which will be incremental to those included in the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan we outlined in February and illustrated on this page. We are evaluating these incremental investments as part of our normal annual planning process. 
These incremental Illinois investments would be directed to the modernization, reconstruction and replacement of aging electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure such as transmission and distribution lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities. It would sustain and improve reliability of our customers and would primarily occur after 2016. We will provide an update on our year-end call in February when we roll forward our long-term investment outlook. 
Turning now to Page 9, in addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2019. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and natural gas delivery systems in the states. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects, which maintain and enhance reliability in our service territory, including projects to meet NERC requirements. In addition, our transmission development team continues to pursue FERC-regulated regional electric transmission projects, focusing on projects in MISO, the BJ interconnection and the Southwest Power Pool. 
Finally, we expect to pursue local and regional transmission opportunities to connect renewable energy sources and natural gas fire generation expected to be built to comply with the Clean Power Plan. 
Turning to Page 10, in Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investment. These include the installation of advanced meters and replacement of aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also expect that our plan for complying with the Clean Power Plan will provide incremental investment opportunities, including those in renewable energy sources and natural gas-fired generation. The impact of the final Clean Power Plan on our operations, infrastructure investment plans and customers rates in Missouri and Illinois will be driven by those state's implementation plans, which may not be finalized until 2018. 
While these will face legal challenges, we are committed to working constructively with state agencies, energy providers and other stakeholders in each state to develop implementation plans that provide customers with electric service that is reliable and reasonably priced. And as we have stated previously, we expect any compliance investment to be recovered in rates. 
The bottom line is that we believe that the investment opportunities I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 11. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.425 per share, reflecting confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings plans. This is a 3.7% increase from the prior quarter's dividend, resulting in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.70 per share. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
Turning now to Page 12. Let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking. 
In addition, our shares provide a current yield of about 3.9%, which is also superior to the average of our peers. We believe this earnings growth outlook and dividend provide a very attractive total return potential for investors. 
We are committed to executing the strategy I have just discussed with you today, and we believe that we will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us on today's call. Now I will now turn the call over to Marty to cover some of the matters I discussed in greater detail."
373264,313704716,895109,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2015",2015-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the prior year period. There we're no adjustments to GAA",1735,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the prior year period. There we're no adjustments to GAAP earnings for these third quarter periods. 
Moving to Page 15. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.21 per share increase in third quarter 2015 results. Key factors included higher retail electric sales volumes, driven by warmer summer temperatures, which increased earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share. 
Third quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the cooler-than-normal summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. So for the year-to-date period, weather remains an estimated $0.05 favorable compared to normal, primarily driven by the colder winter temperatures. 
Before I leave the subject of electric sales volumes, I would like to briefly report on these for the year-to-date period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers increased by approximately 3/4 of 1%, while such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased by approximately 3/4 of 1%. The increase in Illinois sales volumes was driven by the commercial sector while the decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's current energy efficiency plan compensates for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from the plant's programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales from Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by 1/4 of 1%. 
For the first 9 months of 2015, kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois' and Missouri's industrial customers decreased about 1 and 1/2% and about 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and lower sales to our largest Missouri customer, Noranda Aluminum, due to a reduction in consumption at its aluminum smelter. 
Moving back in to a discussion of the quarter's results. The third quarter earnings comparison was also positively affected by increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure using formulaic ratemaking, which increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. In addition, the third quarter earnings comparison benefited by $0.06 per share due to a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois' electric delivery service. Year-to-date, these two timing-related items had a $0.02 per share net favorable impact on results, and we continue to expect they will have no net effect on the full year 2015 earnings. 
Finally, third quarter earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective comparison. The contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Amren Illinois were reduced by a total of $0.03 per share because of lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter Incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROEs.
[Audio Gap]
then reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. 
Regarding third quarter 2015 electric Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.67% allowed ROE compared with 9.25% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year Treasury rate from 3.45% to 2.87%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year Treasury rate. 
Turning now to Page 16. First, as Warner highlighted, we now expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the high end of our previous guidance range. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. I will comment on a few of these items. First, let me remind you that last year, we're making $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter. Of course, we had a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage in the fourth quarter of last year. The absence of the Callaway refueling outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with that year-ago period. 
Second, over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking. 
Moving to factors that are anticipated tax rate, reflecting an unusually low rate in the year-ago period. This is expected to reduce earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. In addition, the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorized.
[Audio Gap]
before we leave our discussion of this year, I would like to mention that we now expect to issue long-term debt at the Ameren parent company and Ameren Illinois during the fourth quarter to repay a substantial portion of our short-term debt. We believe now is a prudent time to reduce short-term borrowings we have been making primarily to help fund our capital investments, including our investments in FERC-regulated transmission. 
Turning to Page 17. I will now update you on select pending regulatory matters. As Warner mentioned, our annual Illinois electric delivery formula ratemaking update filing is pending at the ICC. This filing supports an increase in 2016 electric delivery service rates of $109 million. The ICC staff supports an annual increase of $107 million and other parties are recommending a 100 and -- [ph] an ICC administrative law judge recommendation in this case is expected next week with an ICC final decision in December and new rates effective in January. 
Moving then to Page 18. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois, in which we have requested a $45 million annual rate increase based on the future test year ending in December 2016. Earlier this week, the ICC administrative law judges hearing the case recommended a rate increase amount that was consistent with our request based on the future test year and incorporating a 9.6% ROE, up from the current 9.08% ROE. 
The ALJs also recommended approval of our request for a volume balancing adjustment for residential and small commercial customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in the over or undercollection of revenues from these classes. We expect the ICC to issue a decision in December, with new rates effective in January. 
Turning now to Page 19. As previously mentioned, there are 2 complaint cases pending at the FERC seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page. 
Moving now to Page 20, we plan to provide 2016 earnings guidance and update our longer-term rate base and earnings growth outlook when we release fourth quarter 2015 earnings in February. However, here we list select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. I will highlight some of the more noteworthy ones. 
Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit under forward-looking formula ratemaking from higher rate base from investments and projects at Ameren Illinois and ATXI. For Ameren Illinois electric delivery service, we also anticipate increased earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, again, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2016 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, we expect new rates to be in effect in order to reflect the rate base levels and increased cost contained in our 2016 forward test year rate case filing. 
Moving to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery service earnings will reflect the absence in 2016 of $0.04 per share of 2015 earnings related to an ICC order approving the recovery of power usage cost. For Missouri, the 2016 earnings comparison is expected to be negatively affected by about $0.09 per share for the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016, as again, there is no refueling outage in 2015. 
In addition, we expect increases in depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. Next, as Warner noted, the Missouri commission recently rejected a new proposed three-year energy efficiency plan, which would have begun in January 2016. We're studying the order and evaluating whether to file another proposed plan we have with the Missouri Public Service Commission. Regardless, we do expect to see a continuing reduced load from Amren Missouri's highly successful 2013 to 2015 EMEA energy efficiency program bleed into 2016. 
Given that we haven't finished the 2015 program year, it's premature to estimate what the carryover impact of the current programs will be on 2016. We'll provide an update on our sales expectations in February. A portion of the impact of this load reduction will be offset by a performance incentive expected to be recognized in 2016 from the 2013's 2018 program, subject to commission approval. 
Finally, for Missouri, we expect 2016 earnings will benefit from a decline in operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers or regulatory tracking mechanisms, excluding, of course, Callaway refueling outage expenses. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management actions and is consistent with our ongoing efforts to align our spending with the Missouri regulatory framework and decisions as well as economic decisions. 
Finally, turning to Page 21, I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We have delivered strong earnings year-to-date and expect our 2015 core earnings per share to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share at the high end of our previous guidance range. In addition, we have a superior, long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investments in jurisdictions with modern, constructive ratemaking. 
In addition, and as we discussed during our second quarter conference call, we expect to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity. When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's recently increased dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.9%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We do believe that the MISO may be having a very small FERC order 1000 project approved this year, which would then go out with an RFP next year. And with regard to the Clean Power Plan, MISO is actively working on developing a transmission expansion plan to address what they believe would be some of the impacts of the state plans. Again, we would expect to see more of that later next year or even into 2017. With regard to the ROE, all I can say is we still firmly believe that FERC understands the need for continued transmission developments, and they also understand that the ROE that they set does impact the capital allocation of utilities and if they want that invest to continue, they need to keep the ROE healthy."

But in terms of what's different, I think there are a couple of things just to be mindful of. None of these things ultimately guarantee success, but there are some differences. We think #1, as we said before, we have seen very clearly the constructive outcomes that are resulting from the changes in the Illinois framework, constructive outcomes, which are benefiting customers and clearly benefiting the entire state of Illinois, and so it is just one year. We're seeing several years of those constructive outcomes and those are certainly notable. I think the second thing to be mindful of is that earlier this year, the Governor issued his comprehensive energy plan that included a host of things. But also incorporated in there was a recognition for the need to modernize the framework to support investment. So I think that, too, is something that will be I'm sure, a subject of discussion during the upcoming session. Certainly, I think when you look around at the nation and as you've followed, I think it's becoming clearer as part of our conversations with key stakeholders across the state, that Missouri is lagging behind in terms of their framework, their policies and their investments. So we put all those things together. I think those 2 are differences. Coupled with the fact that we do have new leaders, both in the House and the Senate, and we look forward to working very closely with those new leaders, not just next year but within the years ahead. So all those things, I think, are certainly, you asked what were the differences, those are some of the highlights, I would point out there. In terms of solutions, the bottom line is that there are a lot solutions that have been -- that are out there that we've talked about in the past but also ones being used, utilized across the country. So I guess these are things that we look at and more importantly, discuss with stakeholders because whether there's any legislative initiative that goes forward, it will be informed by those conversations with the key stakeholders across the state. So Michael, I'll ask you if there's anything else to add."

Today, we announced solid third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share in the prior period. The earnings advance reflected higher retail electric sales volumes resulting from warmer summer temperatures that were near normal for the quarter.
The warmer weather raised earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared with 2014. Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are also benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These investments continue to be weighted toward our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses that operate under framework supportive of infrastructure investment.
Further, a seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking for our Illinois electric delivery business positively affected the comparisons for the quarter, as did a lower effective income tax rate.
These positive variances were offset, in part by lower recognized allowed ROEs for our electric transmission and delivery businesses, regulated by the FERC and ICC. I am also pleased to report that our core earnings were $2.44 per share for the first 9 months of 2015, which reflects a strong increase from $2.21 per share for the year-ago period. These results excludes certain items we discussed with you during our second quarter conference call.
Based on these solid results, today, we also narrowed our 2015 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the upper half of our prior core earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Turning now to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. Simply put, the execution of this strategy delivered the solid results [Audio Gap] shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. Overall, I am very pleased with our team's performance through September as we continue to deliver strong value to our customers across all of our businesses.
In particular, we continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks to enhance grid reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage, among other things.
As you can see, we invested $886 million or about 2/3 of our $1.3 billion of year-to-date capital expenditures in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This was a 17% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the same period last year.
Approximately $475 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including the ongoing construction of ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well along on the first of 9 line segments of this project with wires being strung across all 132 erected pole structures. Further, foundation work is underway on 3 additional line segments as this construction of all 10 [Audio Gap] in September, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity for approximately $150 million Spoon River project.  We are now proceeding with [indiscernible] acquisition and line construction in this project is expected to begin late next year.
We also have a request pending at the Missouri Public Service Commission for certificate of public convenience and necessity for the approximately $225 million Mark Twain project in northeastern Missouri and we expect the decision early next year. 
All 3 of these transmission projects: Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO approved
[Audio Gap]
indications pending at the FERC challenging MISOs base-allowed ROE of 12.38% for electric transmission services. We expect a FERC administrative law judge to issue an initial decision in the first of 2 complaint cases later this month. However, the final FERC orders are not expected until 2016 in the first case and 2017 in the second case.
We continue to advocate for an ROE level that is fair and one that will incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. 
Turning to Page 7 of my presentation, let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. Here, we invested approximately $410 million in electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first 9 months of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' Modernization Action Plan. This work, enabled by the state's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, continues to provide significant value to our customers and the state of Illinois.
Notably, our work remains on track to meet or exceed the investments, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals of the act. We have also been focused on achieving positive resolutions of our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case.
Earlier this week, we received a constructive proposed order from the administrative law judges in our natural gas delivery case. In a few weeks, we expect an order from the ALJ in our electric delivery case, where the differences between the parties have been narrowed to $4 million or less.
At the end of the day, based on the progress to date between the parties and both of these cases, we are optimistic that we will receive constructive decisions from the ICC in December.
Moving to Missouri Electric Service. Here, the regulatory framework is not as constructive as those of FERC or Illinois. Nonetheless, it is our goal to earn at or close to our allowed rate of return in all our jurisdictions. Of course, this objective is more challenging in Missouri given the use of a historical test year and on lengthy regulatory approval process, among other things.
As we have done in the past, we are working hard to mitigate this lag by leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts, while aggressively pursuing cost reductions throughout our operating and support organizations.
And when necessary, we will seek adjustments to our Missouri rates to address regulatory lag and to earn a fair return on the investments we are making for the benefit of our customers.
One area where Missouri had historically been a leader in terms of a constructive framework was in energy efficiency. Since 2013, Ameren Missouri has been executing on a comprehensive 3-year energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act, or MEEIA. The MEEIA has provided electric utilities with the appropriate incentives to make investments in energy efficiency for the benefit of our customers. I am pleased to say that Ameren Missouri's first 3-year plan has been even more successful than we anticipated, which has resulted in substantial benefits for our customers.
Earlier this year, we made filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission. We'll start to extend these energy efficiency programs for another 3 years, utilizing a similar structure as well as incorporating best practices learned from our first program.
Unfortunately, last month, the Missouri commission issued an order rejecting our proposed plan. This is disappointing because we believe our proposal provided clear benefits to customers while balancing the interest of shareholders. Under MEEIA, proposing an energy efficiency plan is voluntary, and we are evaluating our next steps.
Finally, I should note, we continue our relentless advocacy efforts for the Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders to enhance the existing regulatory framework to address regulatory lag and support investments. While we continue to make appropriate investments in Missouri to ensure safe and adequate service, Missouri is falling behind other states in modernizing its energy policies and energy infrastructure. That is why we continue to relentlessly advocate for better policies to support investment in Missouri. Our message to Missouri policymakers and stakeholders remains simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments, to upgrade aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs.
We continue to communicate that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those to the state of Illinois and many other states around the country are realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole. And while no final decisions have been made, we continue to look very closely at potential legislative solutions to address this matter during the upcoming 2016 legislative session.
Turning now to Page 8 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital to FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois Electric and natural gas delivery services, because these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and the investment benefits to all of our customers.
To that end, on our second quarter call, we noted that we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses, which will be incremental to those included in the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan we outlined in February and illustrated on this page. We are evaluating these incremental investments as part of our normal annual planning process.
These incremental Illinois investments would be directed to the modernization, reconstruction and replacement of aging electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure such as transmission and distribution lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities. It would sustain and improve reliability of our customers and would primarily occur after 2016. We will provide an update on our year-end call in February when we roll forward our long-term investment outlook.
Turning now to Page 9. In addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2019. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and natural gas delivery systems in the state. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects, which maintain and enhance reliability in our service territory, including projects to meet NERC requirements. In addition, our transmission development team continues to pursue FERC-regulated regional electric transmission projects, focusing on projects in MISO, the PJM interconnection and the Southwest Power Pool.
Finally, we expect to pursue local and regional transmission opportunities to connect renewable energy sources and natural gas fire generation expected to be built to comply with the Clean Power Plan. 
Turning to Page 10. In Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investment. These include the installation of advanced meters and replacement of aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also expect that our plan for complying with the Clean Power Plan will provide incremental investment opportunities, including those in renewable energy sources and natural gas-fired generation. The impact of the final Clean Power Plan on our operations, infrastructure investment plans and customers rates in Missouri and Illinois will be driven by those state's implementation plans which may not be finalized until 2018.
While this rule will face legal challenges, we are committed to working constructively with state agencies, energy providers and other stakeholders in each state to develop implementation plans that provide customers with electric service that is reliable and reasonably priced. And as we have stated previously, we expect any compliance investments to be recovered in rates.
The bottom line is that we believe that the investment opportunities I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders.
Turning now to Page 11. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.425 per share, reflecting confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings plans. This is a 3.7% increase from the prior quarter's dividend, resulting in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.70 per share.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
Turning now to Page 12. Let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking.
In addition, our shares provide a current yield of about 3.9%, which is also superior to the average of our peers. We believe this earnings growth outlook and dividend provide a very attractive total return potential for investors.
We are committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we believe we will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us on today's call.
Now I'll now turn the call over to Marty to cover some of the matters I discussed in greater detail."

Today, we reported third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the prior year period. There were no adjustments to GAAP earnings for these third quarter periods.
Moving to Page 15. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.21 per share increase in third quarter 2015 results. Key factors included higher retail electric sales volumes, driven by warmer summer temperatures, which increased earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share.
Third quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the cooler-than-normal summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. So for the year-to-date period, weather remains an estimated $0.05 favorable compared to normal, primarily driven by the colder winter temperatures.
Before I leave the subject of electric sales volumes, I would like to briefly report on these for the year-to-date period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers increased by approximately 0.75%. While such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased by approximately 0.75%. The increase in Illinois sales volumes was driven by the commercial sector, while the decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's current energy efficiency plan compensates for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from the plans programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by 0.25%. 
For the first 9 months of 2015, kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased about 1% and 1.5% and about 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and lower sales to our largest Missouri customer, Noranda Aluminum, due to a reduction in consumption at its aluminum smelter.
Moving back in to a discussion of the quarter's results. The third quarter earnings comparison was also positively affected by increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure using formulaic ratemaking, which increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter.
In addition, the third quarter earnings comparison benefited by $0.06 per share due to a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois' electric delivery service. Year-to-date, these 2 timing-related items had a $0.02 per share net favorable impact on results, and we continue to expect they will have no net effect on the full year 2015 earnings.
Finally, third quarter earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective [Audio Gap] comparison. The contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois were reduced by a total of $0.03 per share because of lower recognized allowed ROEs.
Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE
[Audio Gap]
reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC.
Regarding third quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.67% allowed ROE compared with 9.25% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.45% to 2.87%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.
Turning now to Page 16. First, as Warner highlighted, we now expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the high end of our previous guidance range. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. I will comment on a few of these items.
First, let me remind you that last year, we earned $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter. Of course, we had a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage in the fourth quarter of last year. The absence of the Callaway refueling outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with that year-ago period.
Second, over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
Moving to factors that are [Audio Gap] tax rate, reflecting an unusually low rate in the year-ago period. This is expected to reduce earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. In addition, the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision 
[Audio Gap]
before we leave our discussion of this year, I would like to mention that we now expect to issue long-term debt at the Ameren parent company and Ameren Illinois during the fourth quarter to repay a substantial portion of the short-term debt. We believe now is a prudent time to reduce short-term borrowings we have been making primarily to help fund our capital investments, including our investments in FERC-regulated transmission.
Turning to Page 17. I will now update you on select pending regulatory matters. As Warner mentioned, our annual Illinois electric delivery formula rate update filing is pending at the ICC. This filing supports an increase in 2016 electric delivery service rates of $109 million. The ICC staff supports an annual increase of $107 million and other parties are recommending a [Audio Gap] an ICC administrative law judge recommendation in this case is expected next week with an ICC final decision in December and new rates effective in January.
Moving then to Page 18. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois, in which we have requested a $45 million annual rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. Earlier this week, the ICC administrative law judges hearing the case recommended a rate increase amount that was consistent with our request based on the future test year and incorporating a 9.6% ROE, up from the current 9.08% ROE.
The ALJs also recommended approval of our request for a volume balancing adjustment for residential and small commercial customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in the over or undercollection of revenues from these classes. We expect the ICC to issue a decision in December, with new rates effective in January.
Turning now to Page 19. As previously mentioned, there are 2 complaint cases pending at the FERC seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.
Moving now to Page 20. We plan to provide 2016 earnings guidance and update our longer-term rate base and earnings growth outlook when we release fourth quarter 2015 earnings in February. However, here we list select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. I will highlight some of the more noteworthy ones.
Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit under forward-looking formula ratemaking from higher rate base, from investments in projects at Ameren Illinois and ATXI. For Ameren Illinois electric delivery service, we also anticipate increased earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, again, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking.
The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2016 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, we expect new rates to be in effect in order to reflect the rate base levels and increase costs contained in our 2016 forward test year rate case filing.
Moving to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery service earnings will reflect the absence in 2016 of $0.04 per share of 2015 earnings related to an ICC order approving the recovery of power usage costs. For Missouri, the 2016 earnings comparison is expected to be negatively affected by about $0.09 per share for the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016, as again, there is no refueling outage in 2015.
In addition, we expect increases in depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. Next, as Warner noted, the Missouri commission recently rejected a new proposed 3-year energy efficiency plan, which would have begun in January 2016. We are studying the order and evaluating whether to file another proposed plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. Regardless, we do expect to see continuing reduced load from Ameren Missouri's highly successful 2013 to 2015 MEEIA energy efficiency program bleed into 2016.
Given that we haven't finished the 2015 program year, it's premature to estimate what the carryover impact of the current programs will be on 2016. We'll provide an update on our sales expectations in February. A portion of the impact of this load reduction will be offset by a performance incentive expected to be recognized in 2016 from the 2013 to 2018 program, subject to commission approval.
Finally, for Missouri, we expect 2016 earnings will benefit from a decline in operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers or regulatory tracking mechanisms, excluding, of course, Callaway refueling outage expenses. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management actions and is consistent with our ongoing efforts to align our spending with the Missouri regulatory framework and decisions as well as economic conditions.
Finally, turning to Page 21. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We have delivered strong earnings year-to-date and expect our 2015 core earnings per share to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share at the high end of our previous guidance range. In addition, we have a superior, long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investments in jurisdictions with modern, constructive ratemaking.
In addition and as we discussed during our second quarter conference call, we expect to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity. When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's recently increased dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.9%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And with regard to the Clean Power Plan, MISO is actively working on developing a transmission expansion plan to address what they believe would be some of the impacts of the state plans. Again, we would expect to see more of that later next year or even into 2017. With regard to the ROE, all I can say is we still firmly believe that FERC understands the need for continued transmission development, and they also understand that the ROE that they set does impact the capital allocation of utilities. And if they want that invest to continue, they need to keep the ROE healthy."

But in terms of what's different, I think there are a couple of things just to be mindful of. None of these things ultimately guarantee success, but there are some differences. I think number one, as we said before, we have seen very clearly the constructive outcomes that are resulting from the changes in the Illinois framework, constructive outcomes which are benefiting customers and clearly benefiting the entire state of Illinois. And so it isn't just one year. We're seeing several years of those constructive outcomes and those are certainly notable. I think the second thing to be mindful of is that earlier this year, the governor issued his comprehensive energy plan that included a host of things. But also incorporated in there was a recognition for the need to modernize the framework to support investment. So I think that too is something that -- that will be I'm sure a subject of discussion during the upcoming session. Certainly, I think when you look around the nation and as you've follow, I think it's becoming clearer as part of our conversations with key stakeholders across the state, that Missouri is lagging behind in terms of their framework and their policies and their investment. So we put all those things together. I think those 2 are differences, coupled with the fact that we do have new leaders, both in the House and the Senate, and we look forward to working very closely with those new leaders, not just next year but in the years ahead. So all those things, I think, are certainly -- you asked for what were some of the differences, those are just some of the highlights, I would point out there. In terms of solutions, look the bottom line is that there are a lot solutions that have been -- that are out there that we've talked about in the past, but also ones that are being used and utilized across the country. So I think it's -- these are things that we look at, but more importantly, we discuss with stakeholders. Because whether there's any legislative initiative that goes forward, it will be informed by those conversations with the key stakeholders across the state. So Michael, I'll ask you if there's anything else to add."

We will then open the call for questions.
Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.
Now here's Warner, who will start on Page 5 of the presentation."

The earnings advance reflected higher retail electr",2180,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced solid third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share in the prior period. The earnings advance reflected higher retail electric sales volumes resulting from warmer summer temperatures that were near normal for the quarter.
The warmer weather raised earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared with 2014. Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are also benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These investments continue to be weighted toward our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses that operate under framework supportive of infrastructure investment.
Further, a seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking for our Illinois electric delivery business positively affected the comparisons for the quarter, as did a lower effective income tax rate.
These positive variances were offset, in part by lower recognized allowed ROEs for our electric transmission and delivery businesses, regulated by the FERC and ICC. I am also pleased to report that our core earnings were $2.44 per share for the first 9 months of 2015, which reflects a strong increase from $2.21 per share for the year-ago period. These results exclude certain items we discussed with you during our second quarter conference call.
Based on these solid results, today, we also narrowed our 2015 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the upper half of our prior core earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.
Turning now to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. Simply put, the execution of this strategy delivered the solid results [Audio Gap] shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. Overall, I am very pleased with our team's performance through September as we continue to deliver strong value to our customers across all of our businesses.
In particular, we continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks to enhance grid reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage, among other things.
As you can see, we invested $886 million or about 2/3 of our $1.3 billion of year-to-date capital expenditures in jurisdictions with these modern constructive regulatory frameworks. This was a 17% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the same period last year.
Approximately $475 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including the ongoing construction of ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well along on the first of 9 line segments of this project with wires being strung across all 132 erected pole structures. Further, foundation work is underway on 3 additional line segments as is construction of all 10 [Audio Gap] in September, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity for approximately $150 million Spoon River project.  We are now proceeding with right-of-way acquisition and line construction in this project is expected to begin late next year.
We also have a request pending at the Missouri Public Service Commission for certificate of public convenience and necessity for the approximately $225 million Mark Twain project in northeastern Missouri and we expect a decision early next year. 
All 3 of these transmission projects: Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO approved
[Audio Gap]
indications pending at the FERC challenging MISOs base-allowed ROE of 12.38% for electric transmission services. We expect a FERC administrative law judge to issue an initial decision in the first of 2 complaint cases later this month. However, the final FERC orders are not expected until 2016 in the first case and 2017 in the second case.
We continue to advocate for an ROE level that is fair and one that will incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. 
Turning to Page 7 of my presentation, let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. Here, we invested approximately $410 million in electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first 9 months of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' Modernization Action Plan. This work, enabled by the state's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, continues to provide significant value to our customers and the state of Illinois.
Notably, our work remains on track to meet or exceed the investment, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals of the act. We have also been focused on achieving positive resolutions of our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case.
Earlier this week, we received a constructive proposed order from the administrative law judges in our natural gas delivery case. In a few weeks, we expect an order from the ALJ in our electric delivery case, where the differences between the parties have been narrowed to $4 million or less.
At the end of the day, based on the progress to date between the parties in both of these cases, we are optimistic that we will receive constructive decisions from the ICC in December.
Moving to Missouri Electric Service. Here, the regulatory framework is not as constructive as those of FERC or Illinois. Nonetheless, it is our goal to earn at or close to our allowed rate of return in all our jurisdictions. Of course, this objective is more challenging in Missouri given the use of a historical test year and on lengthy regulatory approval process, among other things.
As we have done in the past, we are working hard to mitigate this lag by leveraging ongoing enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts, while aggressively pursuing cost reductions throughout our operating and support organizations.
And when necessary, we will seek adjustments to our Missouri rates to address regulatory lag and to earn a fair return on the investments we are making for the benefit of our customers.
One area where Missouri had historically been a leader in terms of a constructive regulatory framework was in energy efficiency. Since 2013, Ameren Missouri has been executing on a comprehensive 3-year energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act, or MEEIA. The MEEIA has provided electric utilities with the appropriate incentives to make investments in energy efficiency for the benefit of our customers. I am pleased to say that Ameren Missouri's first 3-year plan has been even more successful than we anticipated, which has resulted in substantial benefits for our customers.
Earlier this year, we made a filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which sought to extend these energy efficiency programs for another 3 years, utilizing a similar structure as well as incorporating best practices learned from our first program.
Unfortunately, last month, the Missouri commission issued an order rejecting our proposed plan. This is disappointing because we believe our proposal provided clear benefits to customers while balancing the interest of shareholders. Under MEEIA, proposing an energy efficiency plan is voluntary, and we are evaluating our next steps.
Finally, I should note, we continue our relentless advocacy efforts for the Missouri's policymakers and key stakeholders to enhance the existing regulatory framework, to address regulatory lag and support investments. While we continue to make appropriate investments in Missouri to ensure safe and adequate service, Missouri is falling behind other states in modernizing its energy policies and energy infrastructure. That is why we continue to relentlessly advocate for better policies to support investment in Missouri. Our message to Missouri policymakers and stakeholders remains simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state's regulatory framework is essential to spur needed investments, to upgrade aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs.
We continue to communicate that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those that the state of Illinois and many other states around the country are realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole. And while no final decisions have been made, we continue to look very closely at potential legislative solutions to address this matter during the upcoming 2016 legislative session.
Turning now to Page 8 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital to FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois Electric and natural gas delivery services, because these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and the investment benefits all of our customers.
To that end, on our second quarter call, we noted that we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses, which would be incremental to those included in the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan we outlined in February and illustrated on this page. We are evaluating these incremental investments as part of our normal annual planning process.
These incremental Illinois investments would be directed to the modernization, reconstruction and replacement of aging electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure such as transmission and distribution lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities. It would sustain and improve reliability for our customers and would primarily occur after 2016. We will provide an update on our year-end call in February when we roll forward our long-term investment outlook.
Turning now to Page 9. In addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2019. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and natural gas delivery systems in the state. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects, which maintain and enhance reliability in our service territory, including projects to meet NERC requirements. In addition, our transmission development team continues to pursue FERC-regulated regional electric transmission projects, focusing on projects in MISO, the PJM interconnection and the Southwest Power Pool.
Finally, we expect to pursue local and regional transmission opportunities to connect renewable energy sources and natural gas fire generation expected to be built to comply with the Clean Power Plan. 
Turning to Page 10. In Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investment. These include the installation of advanced meters and replacement of aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also expect that our plan for complying with the Clean Power Plan will provide incremental investment opportunities, including those in renewable energy sources and natural gas-fired generation. The impact of the final Clean Power Plan on our operations, infrastructure investment plans and customers rates in Missouri and Illinois will be driven by those state's implementation plans which may not be finalized until 2018.
While this rule will face legal challenges, we are committed to working constructively with state agencies, energy providers and other stakeholders in each state to develop implementation plans that provide customers with electric service that is reliable and reasonably priced. And as we have stated previously, we expect any compliance investments to be recovered in rates.
The bottom line is that we believe that the investment opportunities I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders.
Turning now to Page 11. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.425 per share, reflecting confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings plans. This is a 3.7% increase from the prior quarter's dividend, resulting in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.70 per share.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.
Turning now to Page 12. Let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking.
In addition, our shares provide a current yield of about 3.9%, which is also superior to the average of our peers. We believe this earnings growth outlook and dividend provide a very attractive total return potential for investors.
We are committed to executing the strategy I have discussed with you today, and we believe we will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us on today's call.
Now I'll now turn the call over to Marty to cover some of the matters I discussed in greater detail."

Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the prior year period. There were no adjustments to GAAP",1726,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the prior year period. There were no adjustments to GAAP earnings for these third quarter periods.
Moving to Page 15. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.21 per share increase in third quarter 2015 results. Key factors included higher retail electric sales volumes, driven by warmer summer temperatures, which increased earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share.
Third quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the cooler-than-normal summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. So for the year-to-date period, weather remains an estimated $0.05 favorable compared to normal, primarily driven by the colder winter temperatures.
Before I leave the subject of electric sales volumes, I would like to briefly report on these for the year-to-date period. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers increased by approximately 0.75%. While such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased by approximately 0.75%. The increase in Illinois sales volumes was driven by the commercial sector, while the decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's current energy efficiency plan compensates for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from the plans programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by 0.25%. 
For the first 9 months of 2015, kilowatt hour sales to Illinois' and Missouri's industrial customers decreased about 1.5% and about 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low-margin Illinois agricultural customer and lower sales to our largest Missouri customer, Noranda Aluminum, due to a reduction in consumption at its aluminum smelter.
Moving back then to a discussion of the quarter's results. The third quarter earnings comparison was also positively affected by increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure using formulaic ratemaking, which increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter.
In addition, the third quarter earnings comparison benefited by $0.06 per share due to a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois' electric delivery service. Year-to-date, these 2 timing-related items had a $0.02 per share net favorable impact on results, and we continue to expect they will have no net effect on the full year 2015 earnings.
Finally, third quarter earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective [Audio Gap] comparison. The contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois were reduced by a total of $0.03 per share because of lower recognized allowed ROEs.
Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE
[Audio Gap]
reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC.
Regarding third quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.67% allowed ROE compared with 9.25% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.45% to 2.87%. Of course, full year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.
Turning now to Page 16. First, as Warner highlighted, we now expect our 2015 core earnings to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the high end of our previous guidance range. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. I will comment on a few of these items.
First, let me remind you that last year, we earned $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter. Of course, we had a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage in the fourth quarter of last year. The absence of the Callaway refueling outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with that year-ago period.
Second, over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.
Moving to factors that are [Audio Gap] tax rate, reflecting an unusually low rate in the year-ago period. This is expected to reduce earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. In addition, the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision 
[Audio Gap]
before we leave our discussion of this year, I would like to mention that we now expect to issue long-term debt at the Ameren parent company and Ameren Illinois during the fourth quarter to repay a substantial portion of their short-term debt. We believe now is a prudent time to reduce short-term borrowings we have been making primarily to help fund our capital investments, including our investments in FERC-regulated transmission.
Turning to Page 17. I will now update you on select pending regulatory matters. As Warner mentioned, our annual Illinois electric delivery formula rate update filing is pending at the ICC. This filing supports an increase in 2016 electric delivery service rates of $109 million. The ICC staff supports an annual increase of $107 million and other parties are recommending a [Audio Gap] an ICC administrative law judge recommendation in this case is expected next week with an ICC final decision in December and new rates effective in January.
Moving then to Page 18. We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois, in which we have requested a $45 million annual rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. Earlier this week, the ICC administrative law judges hearing the case recommended a rate increase amount that was consistent with our request based on a future test year and incorporating a 9.6% ROE, up from the current 9.08% ROE.
The ALJs also recommended approval of our request for a volume balancing adjustment for residential and small commercial customers. This would ensure the changes in natural gas sales volumes do not result in the over or under collection of revenues from these classes. We expect the ICC to issue a decision in December, with new rates effective in January.
Turning now to Page 19. As previously mentioned, there are 2 complaint cases pending at the FERC seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.
Moving now to Page 20. We plan to provide 2016 earnings guidance and update our longer-term rate base and earnings growth outlook when we release fourth quarter 2015 earnings in February. However, here we list select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. I will highlight some of the more noteworthy ones.
Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit under forward-looking formula ratemaking from higher rate base, from investments in projects at Ameren Illinois and ATXI. For Ameren Illinois electric delivery service, we also anticipate increased earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, again, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking.
The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2016 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, we expect new rates to be in effect in order to reflect rate base levels and increase costs contained in our 2016 forward test year rate case filing.
Moving to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery service earnings will reflect the absence in 2016 of $0.04 per share of 2015 earnings related to an ICC order approving the recovery of power usage costs. For Missouri, the 2016 earnings comparison is expected to be negatively affected by about $0.09 per share for the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016, as again, there is no refueling outage in 2015.
In addition, we expect increases in depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. Next, as Warner noted, the Missouri commission recently rejected a new proposed 3-year energy efficiency plan, which would have begun in January 2016. We are studying the order and evaluating whether to file another proposed plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. Regardless, we do expect to see continuing reduced load from Ameren Missouri's highly successful 2013 to 2015 MEEIA energy efficiency program bleed into 2016.
Given that we haven't finished the 2015 program year, it's premature to estimate what the carryover impact of the current programs will be on 2016. We'll provide an update on our sales expectations in February. A portion of the impact of this load reduction will be offset by a performance incentive expected to be recognized in 2016 from the 2013 to 2018 program, subject to commission approval.
Finally, for Missouri, we expect 2016 earnings will benefit from a decline in operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, excluding, of course, Callaway refueling outage expenses. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management actions and is consistent with our ongoing efforts to align our spending with the Missouri regulatory framework and decisions as well as economic conditions.
Finally, turning to Page 21. I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We have delivered strong earnings year-to-date and expect our 2015 core earnings per share to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share at the high end of our previous guidance range. In addition, we have a superior, long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investments in jurisdictions with modern, constructive ratemaking.
In addition and as we discussed during our second quarter conference call, we expect to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity. When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's recently increased dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.9%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

First of all, with regard to either Wood River or Clinton, which Clinton has not, at this point in time, definitively said anything.

And with regard to the Clean Power Plan, MISO is actively working on developing a transmission expansion plan to address what they believe would be some of the impacts of the state plans. Again, we would expect to see more of that later next year or even into 2017. With regard to the ROE, all I can say is we still firmly believe that FERC understands the need for continued transmission development, and they also understand that the ROE that they set does impact the capital allocation of utilities. And if they want that investment to continue, they need to keep the ROE healthy."

But in terms of what's different, I think there are a couple of things just to be mindful of. None of these things ultimately guarantee success, but there are some differences. I think number one, as we said before, we have seen very clearly the constructive outcomes that are resulting from the changes in the Illinois framework, constructive outcomes which are benefiting customers and clearly benefiting the entire state of Illinois. And so it isn't just one year. We're seeing several years of those constructive outcomes and those are certainly notable. I think the second thing to be mindful of is that earlier this year, the governor issued his comprehensive energy plan that included a host of things. But also incorporated in there was a recognition for the need to modernize the framework to support investment. So I think that too is something that -- that will be I'm sure a subject of discussion during the upcoming session. Certainly, I think when you look around at the nation and as you've follow, I think it's becoming clearer as part of our conversations with key stakeholders across the state, that Missouri is lagging behind in terms of their framework and their policies and their investment. So we put all those things together. I think those 2 are differences, coupled with the fact that we do have new leaders, both in the House and the Senate, and we look forward to working very closely with those new leaders, not just next year but in the years ahead. So all those things, I think, are certainly -- you asked for what were some of the differences, those are just some of the highlights, I would put out there. In terms of solutions, look the bottom line is that there are a lot of solutions that are being -- that are out there that we've talked about in the past, but also ones that are being used and utilized across the country. So I think it's -- these are things that we look at, but more importantly, we discuss with stakeholders. Because whether there's any legislative initiative that goes forward, it will be informed by those conversations with the key stakeholders across the state. So Michael, I'll ask you if there's anything else to add."

I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to overstate the importance of the comprehensive state energy plan. But anyhow really, it was a thoughtful document, it was a collaborative process, really brought together through both utilities as well as environmental groups and others. And there are a number of recommendations in there about modernizing the electric infrastructure, enacting legislation that provides for accelerated grid modernization, reforming Missouri's utility ratemaking process. And so there really is a framework, I think, to bring forth these discussions or a number of interested parties and trying to see that happen, because there's a number of things in there. They would like to get done as well. And so I think it really does provide a catalyst to try to put something forward."

And there was also -- they were very focused on reducing demand and our programs are really designed on reducing energy. So those are a couple of things, we just -- we have to go back and think about and see if there's a solution forward. These are important programs. They really have worked well.

Some of those are for NERC projects, especially those that are within Ameren Illinois. We don't call them out separately. There is certainly NERC-related projects happening in Missouri as well. And then also, as we've mentioned that while we got there 6% rate base growth out through 2019, it doesn't yet -- hasn't yet been updated to reflect any of the $500 million to $1 billion of incremental projects that we're evaluating. As you know, it's 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 between Illinois distribution, electric distribution, gas distribution and FERC-regulated transmission. A portion of those monies too could go to -- towards NERC reliability projects.
