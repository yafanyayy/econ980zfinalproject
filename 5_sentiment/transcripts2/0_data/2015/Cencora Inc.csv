As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen Associates delivered excellent financial results in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $33.6 billion, our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 42% to $1.14 while we generated a very strong $900 million in operating cash flow. One of the most gratifying aspects of this quarter's results is that it was driven by strong performance from virtually every one of our businesses. The strength of these core business positions and offerings, combined with our disciplined capital management, gives us the flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we make plans to broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings to a new market segment. 
Earlier in January, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire MWI Veterinary Supply, a premier animal health distributor for $2.5 billion in cash. We commenced this tender offer for all outstanding shares of MWI on January 26, and we expect to close the transaction during the March quarter. As I said when we first announced the deal, ABC has delivered significant growth and shareholder value by staying focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain where we have developed unparalleled knowledge and expertise and by bringing a collaborative philosophy to all of our relationships. Jim Cleary and his team at MWI will be ideal partners with whom to build on that foundation and extend our reach into the growing global animal health sector. MWI is already well-respected for their great success since the company was founded in 1976 and went public in 2005, but we believe that by combining MWI's legacy of success and innovation with ABC's relevant experience in manufacturer and provider services and our global reach, we will create a compelling opportunity to launch the next generation of superior animal health products and services. I'm very excited about the future contributions that Jim and his team will make to AmerisourceBergen and about to the potential for growth that we see ahead. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the December quarter. Overall, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2015 and we have set ourselves up well to meet our strategic and updated financial objectives for the full year. Turning on the momentum as we exited fiscal 2014, our performance in the first quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth and a significant improvement in working capital led to stellar cash flow, especially for our December quarter. Let me provide further details, and I want to call out some highlights from our business units. Last quarter, I noted that our individual business units continuously became less distinct from one another by focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our ability to achieve comprehensive enterprise-wide solutions is particularly valuable in a fast-changing market and is a key driver of our results. Many of these solutions are, of course, in the specialty area, and the unique combination of services and expertise we offer how does manufacturers and customers manage the challenges of the fast-growing area of the market. Just as specialty products now permeate every segment of our business, discussions about opportunities within the specialty realm are top of mind from virtually all of our customers. We believe we are the best-positioned to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products -- of advanced specialty products for manufacturer health care providers and the patients they serve. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter, with revenues up 15% even as we anniversary-ed the first full quarter of the Walgreens brand business. Overall market growth trends remain quite good and a strong flu season was clearly helpful to our overall retail and vaccine sales numbers. The December quarter was the first full quarter where we had all of the branded generic business from Walgreens, and we are very pleased to have the distribution contract fully implemented. Good organic growth overcame the rolloff of some old business, and the sales of the new hepatitis C drug class also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall, drug pricing trends remain quite favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers, all performed well in the quarter.  A good number of pharmacy customers benefiting from favorable market conditions, as well as some ABC-specific programs, including those that include independent retail pharmacies' access to specialty products such as the new hepatitis C drugs and other therapies. Our diverse customer base helps us ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies, as well as long-established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships ensures our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. 
During the quarter, we continue to reap the benefits of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots alliance in both the distribution to Walgreens stores and the contribution from the sourcing joint venture. We are very pleased with the progress the JV has made to date and going forward, we will work collaboratively to ensure the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers. In addition, we have made significant progress in our BluePoint private label program and in ramping up activities in ABC Switzerland. All of these activities are demonstrative of the value that whole set has bring to the supply chain and of the specific innovations AmerisourceBergen brings to the table. 
During the quarter, we officially opened our national distribution center in Columbus, the state-of-the-art facility helped drive logistics and inventory management efficiency for both ABC and our manufacture partners. This and other investments we have made and continue to make in our infrastructure enable us to meaningfully enhance our services and strengthen our ability to grow our business over the long term. ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing post changes on certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG's revenues were up 17%. Our position distribution business performed very well, and ASG was particularly strong in the December quarter. Given my long history with our community oncology business and our confidence in our offerings in this area, it is especially gratifying to report that our community oncology business grew ahead of expectations in the December quarter. This was due to a mix of new business, earlier than expected price increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persists and sales of practices to help systems continues although at a smaller rate, we are hopefully seeing stabilization on the community oncology market which is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology treatments will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well-positioned to ensure that our customers remain in the forefront of the evolution of cancer care. 
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a strong quarter with both Consulting Services and World Courier performing very well. The unrivaled service offerings in this area are of keen interest to both our manufacturer and provider customers and a key driver of value as the cost and complexity of medication therapies increase. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy area, along with our experience in developing patient access and adherence programs is a clear differentiator today and an opportunity for growth in the future, particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market. Our knowledge base, combined with the immense scale of our distribution businesses and an increasingly global reach make us the ideal partner for those who want to be in the position to lead the next evolutionary change in health care. 
As I've said many times, it is an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. The R&D pipeline is full of innovative products that hold the potential to make great strides across many disease states. The combination of advanced therapeutic medicine and expanding access to health care drives growth opportunities and more importantly meaningfully improves patient lives. Many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. As Americans age, pet ownership is increasing, and pets themselves are living longer. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining pet health. In addition, the increasingly global demand for protein drives demands on the production side of the market. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding the transaction, and we firmly believe that MWI is a premier distributor in these 2 areas of business focus, and we are very excited to add animal health to our portfolio of services. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Generic inflation was strong in the December quarter but has been modest so far in January. We also had some brand price increases in December that we have been expecting to see in January, particularly in specialty. As a result, we expect that the contribution from generic inflation will be flat in the remaining quarters versus last year and that brand inflation will remain strong. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium approved by the FDA, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the timing of the launch of the product into the marketplace and the extent to which there will be competition manufacturers of the generic. Given these trends in our performance in the December quarter, it raised our guidance for the remainder of the year in a few key areas. Tim will provide greater detail, but in summary, on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 11%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 12% to 15%, free cash flow generation in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As a result of cash figures in part to fund the MWI transaction, we reduced the amount of share repurchases we expect to complete in fiscal 2015 and our regular share repurchase program to $200 million. But we will complete $400 million of repurchases under the special program as we have previously discussed. 
Another noteworthy event for AmerisourceBergen was the January 16 announcement that have joined our board. Is one of the most experienced wholesale executives in our global industry. Onella is a pharmacist by profession and has long championed the role of global community pharmacy during the well-regarded Alfaga Network of pharmacies. Currently serves as Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots alliance and President and Chief Executive of Global Wholesale and International Retail. We look forward to Onella's participation in our board. 
One final word about the December quarter before I hand over to Tim, I'm very pleased with outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved across our entire business. There are many moving parts in the remainder of fiscal 2015, but I'm confident that we will meet our objectives for the year. Meeting our financial and operational goals is only one dimension of success, however. It is the combination of unmatched execution and bold innovative thinking that really drives long-term value. So I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations while creatively looking forward to the future. The strength of our core business gives us a powerful platform upon which to build, and that gives me great confidence that we will continue to make new and vital contributions to the marketplace, and thereby continue to provide excellent returns to our shareholders. 
Now, here is Tim."

As Steve mentioned, we're off to an excellent start for fiscal '15. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are the first quarter ended December 2014 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have 2 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap first quarter consolidated and segment performance, and second, I will cover our revised fiscal '15 expectations. 
With that, we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 15%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continues to drive our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix and positive trends in the industry. As a reminder, this marks the first quarter that we had the Walgreens generic volume for all stores for the entire quarter. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for slightly over half of our 15% revenue growth. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 24% to $896 million. The growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth on both brand and generics. Also, we continue to benefit from a strong manufacturer pricing environment. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased 15% to $461 million. Expense increase correlated with a large revenue increase in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Consistent with past quarters, the increase in expenses were primarily related to distributions in our labor expense, delivery cost and depreciation of capital assets to support the business ramp. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $436 million, up about $130 million or a very strong 35% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.30%, up 19 basis points.  Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $15 million down about 19% due primarily to the refinancing of debt which we completed last year. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 37.9% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. Looking out for the full year, we still expect our tax rate to be about 37% driven by growth in our International businesses and for the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 43% to $1.14, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth.  Our adjusted diluted share count was 229 million shares down roughly 3%. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $33 billion, up 15%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Company led the way with a 15% revenue increase. Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 4 items. One, as I mentioned earlier, we reached full delivery of all generic drugs to all Walgreens locations for the full quarter; two, our sales to Walgreens exceeded our expectations, especially generics; and three, we continue to see the revenue benefit from the uptake in hepatitis C drugs. These drugs accounted for roughly 1/3 of the drug company's total revenue growth; and then, finally, four, overall market growth, driven by volume and strong pricing. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 26%. It is widely reported 2 manufacturers shifted certain infused oncology drugs from full line distribution to specialty distribution. Excluding this shift, our specialty business still grew an impressive 17%, with growth coming from oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We also had very good growth in our community oncology business, driven by positive pricing trends and some new business. Finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth due to new business wins, volume growth with existing manufacturer customers. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in the past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $752 million, up $158 million or about 27%. Drug Company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth. And in both drug and specialty, we experienced better-than-expected brand and generic price appreciation. This segment did see better-than-expected gross profit from a late flu season and also the continued growth of our private label program, BluePoint. Operating expenses were $362 million and were up about 18%. As I mentioned previously, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting of the segment's significant volume growth. As an example, our Drug Company shipped roughly 2x the number of units this quarter compared to last year. As a result of being fully ramped now with Walgreens generic volume, the growth in the Walgreens business and growth from our other customer counts. Segment operating income was $390 million and up about 36%, driven by the outstanding performance of the Drug Company. As Steve highlighted, we're also extremely pleased with our specialty business and the fast growth they have. The operating income growth rate in the mid-teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services and World Courier. In the quarter, segment revenues increased $92 million or about 15% to $696 million. Roughly 60% of the segment's revenue dollar growth came from TheraCom, our distribution business, within consulting. We did experienced a very good growth rate in our core consulting business in the teams during the start of several new manufacturer programs and the organic growth in existing programs. World Courier also had a solid revenue growth, however, their revenue growth was somewhat dampened by foreign currency exchange rates. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $45 million, reflecting growth of 26%. Consulting and World Courier each contributed about equally today income growth. Consulting contributed primarily through top line growth. World Courier contributed through a combination of top line growth and expense management. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and quickly cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants, the fair value of the warrants increased by about $600 million through approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, correlated to the increase in the ABC share price for the same period. This resulted in a total expense of $371 million for the quarter about 80% of this expense is the retroactive adjustment needed to properly report expense through the eighth quarters we've had the warrants outstanding. 
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expensive $144 million which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year LIFO expense was estimated using 2 key assumptions. One, price inflation remains at the same levels for both branded generics, as what we've experienced last year, and two, we are forecasting a higher inventory balance at year-end due to overall business growth versus our previous year end. These assumptions are driving the large expected full year LIFO expense. And we will, of course, update our assumptions moving forward each quarter. 
This wraps up our P&L review. I'd like to now cover working capital and cash flow items. This quarter, we had terrific cash flow, $840 million. We are clearly benefiting from the growth in our generic drug volumes which have much better payable terms, specifically our DPO or days payable to suppliers, improved nearly 6 days from last year. again, this reflects a larger mix of business being generics. Our free cash flow also benefited from a onetime reduction in inventory of about $150 million in the closing of our old Florida distribution center. The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks. Through the quarter, our regular share buybacks are $132 million. We ended the quarter with $443 million available and our regular share repurchase authorization. We also purchased the same dollar amount under our special share repurchase program. And as a reminder, these shares are specifically designated to offset expected dilution from the warrants. They are not included in our adjusted share count. We ended the quarter with $266 million available on our special share authorization. 
During the quarter, we also took steps to improve our warrant hedging position. We partnered with a bank to increase the ceilings specifically on our 2016 cap calls. Given the increase in our share price. As a result, we have incurred a liability of about $78 million through December 31. We finished the program in mid-January at a total cost of $100 million. And as a reminder, there's no P&L impact in connection with our hedging program. 
Now let's turn to our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My initial guidance comments that I will cover this morning excludes the impact from the MWI transaction. So you have a better comparable to the guidance we provided back in late October. Ant the very end I will make a few comments about to the impact to guidance with MWI included. Revenues based on positive trends in our business and the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 10% to 11% range. 
Gross profit. Let me comment on 2 specific items within gross profit. The first would be generic price appreciation. As I mentioned earlier, generic price inflation was better-than-expected in our first quarter. While the trend in the past several quarters is for manufacturers to raise prices in the first month of the quarter, so far in January, we haven't seen much activity in this area. Therefore, nearly 4 months into our fiscal year, we're not changing our full year assumption. We are confident that our annual expectation will be met, which is flat dollars compared to last year. The second item is generic drug launches. There has been recent news about generic Nexium entering the market. At this point, there are still many open questions about the launch, including when product would be available, how quickly the FDA will approve other manufacturers who have filed ANDAs, the timing of those launches, the ability of manufacturers to produce enough product to cover the large market and the impact of potential court action. At this point, we do not expect the launch of generic Nexium to be as beneficial as we originally expected. Therefore, we have lowered our assumption in the gross contribution from this item, especially in the second half of the year. 
Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be 9% to 11%, driven by our first quarter performance and higher anticipated full year revenue growth. However, the change in our generic Nexium contribution assumption that I just called out is a partial offset to income growth. 
Operating margin. We now expect our operating margin to be relatively flat in fiscal '15. This is due primarily to higher brand drug revenues, including the continued growth in hepatitis C drugs. Adjusted EPS, we now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% from last year's adjusted EPS. Importantly, as you think about our EPS quarterly progression, we now expect that our combined adjusted EPS in the first half of the fiscal year will be slightly greater than the combined adjusted EPS in our second half. 
Share repurchases. Our revised guidance for regular share repurchases is $200 million for the full year, down from previous guidance due to cash that will be used in conjunction with the MWI closing. We remain committed to $400 million in special share repurchases for the full year. 
Switching to our free cash flow guidance, the better growth in generic revenues and generics having significantly better working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As I highlighted, assuming that we successfully closed the MWI transaction in the March quarter, we will provide more detailed guidance on our April earnings call. For today's call, we will reiterate that MWI will add an incremental $0.08 to our adjusted EPS spread evenly between our June and September quarters. This means that our guidance range, including the contribution from MWI, will be $4.53 to $4.63. 
So in summary, one quarter doesn't make a year. We have a long way to go, but we are off to a great start. Our commitment is that we will continue to work hard servicing our customers. We will deploy capital properly and we will make the right decisions to grow our business for the long run. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

But we're not really affected by the economics, the economics on the buy-side between the various manufacturers are pretty similar, probably within few basis points of each other. So really, we are agnostic. But again, it's just a great -- it's a great boon to our customers. There's been a strong participation by community pharmacy, ABC is very strong in the alternate care segment where a lot of these products are being dispensed and patients are accessing their medications. So it's been a great trend for our whole industry. And we couldn't be more proud of our role in helping eliminate what is a serious health care issue.

The pricing, ins and outs, changes, what goes on now with patents is becoming more and more obtuse -- Nexium is another great example of how difficult this is to forecast.

As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen Associates delivered excellent financial results in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $33.6 billion, our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 42% to $1.14 while we generated a very strong $900 million in operating cash flow. One of the most gratifying aspects of this quarter's results is that it was driven by strong performance from virtually every one of our businesses. The strength of these core business positions and offerings, combined with our disciplined capital management, gives us the flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we make plans to broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings to a new market segment. 
Earlier in January, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire MWI Veterinary Supply, a premier animal health distributor, for $2.5 billion in cash. We commenced this tender offer for all outstanding shares of MWI on January 26, and we expect to close the transaction during the March quarter. As I've said when we first announced the deal, ABC has delivered significant growth and shareholder value by staying focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain where we have developed unparalleled knowledge and expertise and by bringing a collaborative philosophy to all of our relationships. Jim Cleary and his team at MWI will be ideal partners with whom to build on that foundation and extend our reach into the growing global animal health sector. MWI is already well respected for their great success since the company was founded in 1976 and went public in 2005, but we believe that by combining MWI's legacy of success and innovation with ABC's relevant experience in manufacturer and provider services and our global reach, we will create a compelling opportunity to launch the next generation of superior animal health products and services. I'm very excited about the future contributions that Jim and his team will make to AmerisourceBergen and about to the potential for growth that we see ahead. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the December quarter. Overall, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2015 and we have set ourselves up well to meet our strategic and updated financial objectives for the full year. Running on the momentum as we had -- as we exited fiscal 2014, our performance in the first quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth, combined with operating leverage, drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth and a significant improvement in working capital led to stellar cash flow, especially for our December quarter. Tim will provide further details, and I want to call out some highlights from our business units. Last quarter, I noted that our individual business units continuously became less distinct from one another by focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our ability to achieve comprehensive enterprise-wide solutions is particularly valuable in a fast-changing market and is a key driver of our results. Many of these solutions are, of course, in the specialty area, and the unique combination of services and expertise we offer helps manufacturers and customers manage the challenges of the fast-growing area of the market. Just as specialty products now permeate nearly every segment of our business, discussions about opportunities within the specialty realm are top of mind for virtually all of our customers. We believe we are the best physician to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products for manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter, with revenues up 15% even as we anniversary-ed the first full quarter of the Walgreens brand business. Overall market growth trends remain quite good and a strong flu season was clearly helpful to our overall retail and vaccine sales numbers. The December quarter was the first full quarter where we had all of the brand and generic business from Walgreens, and we are very pleased to have the distribution contract fully implemented. Good organic growth overcame the rolloff of some old business, and sales of the new hepatitis C drug class also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall drug pricing trends remain quite favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy customers are benefiting from favorable market conditions as well as some ABC-specific programs, including those that improve independent retail pharmacies' access to specialty products such as the new hepatitis C drugs and other therapies. Our diverse customer base helps us ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long-established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships ensures our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. 
During the quarter, we continue to reap the benefits of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance in both the distribution to Walgreens stores and the contribution from the sourcing joint venture. We are very pleased with the progress the JV has made to date and going forward, we will work collaboratively to ensure the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers. In addition, we have made significant progress in our BluePoint private label program and in ramping up activities in ABC Switzerland. All of these activities are demonstrative of the value that whole sellers bring to the supply chain and of the specific innovations AmerisourceBergen brings to the table. 
During the quarter, we officially opened our national distribution center in Columbus. The state-of-the-art facility helps drive logistics and inventory management efficiency for both ABC and our manufacture partners. This and other investments we have made and continue to make in our infrastructure enable us to meaningfully enhance our services and strengthen our ability to grow our business over the long term. ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing post changes on certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG's revenues were up 17%. Our physician distribution business performed very well, and ASG was particularly strong in the December quarter. Given my long history with our community oncology business and our confidence in our offerings in this area, it is especially gratifying to report that our community oncology business grew ahead of expectations in the December quarter. This was due to a mix of new business, some earlier than expected price increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persists and sales of practices to help systems continues, although at a slower rate, we are hopefully seeing stabilization on the community oncology market which is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology treatments will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well positioned to ensure that our customers remain in the forefront of the evolution of cancer care. 
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a strong quarter with both Consulting Services and World Courier performing very well. The unrivaled service offerings in this area are of keen interest to both our manufacturer and provider customers and a key driver of value as the cost and complexity of medication therapies increase. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy area, along with our experience in developing patient access and adherence programs is a clear differentiator today and an opportunity for growth in the future, particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market. Our knowledge base, combined with the immense scale of our distribution businesses and our increasingly global reach, make us the ideal partner for those who want to be in the position to lead the next evolutionary change in health care. 
As I've said many times, it is an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. R&D pipeline is full of innovative products that hold the potential to make great strides across many disease states. The combination of advanced therapeutic medicine and expanding access to health care drives growth opportunities and more importantly meaningfully improves patient lives. Many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. As Americans age, pet ownership is increasing, and pets themselves are living longer. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining pet health. In addition, the increasingly global demand for protein drives demands on the production side of the market. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding the transaction, and we firmly believe that MWI is a premier distributor in these 2 areas of business focus, and we are very excited to add animal health to our portfolio of services. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue, while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Generic inflation was strong in the December quarter but has been modest so far in January. We also had some brand price increases in December that we have been expecting to see in January, particularly in specialty. As a result, we expect that the contribution from generic inflation will be flat in the remaining quarters versus last year and that brand inflation will remain strong. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium approved by the FDA, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the timing of the launch of the product into the marketplace and the extent to which there will be competition between manufacturers of the generic. Given these trends in our performance in the December quarter, it raised our guidance for the remainder of the year in a few key areas. Tim will provide greater detail, but in summary, on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 11%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 12% to 15%, free cash flow generation in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As a result of cash figures in part to fund the MWI transaction, we reduced the amount of share repurchases we expect to complete in fiscal 2015 and our regular share repurchase program to $200 million. But we will complete $400 million of repurchases under the special program as we have previously discussed. 
Another noteworthy event for AmerisourceBergen was the January 16 announcement that Ornella Barra had joined our board. Ornella is one of the most experienced wholesale executives in our global industry. Ornella is a pharmacist by profession and has long championed the role of global community pharmacy during the well-regarded Alphega Network of pharmacies. Ms. Barra currently serves as Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President and Chief Executive of Global Wholesale and International Retail. We look forward to Ornella's participation on our board. 
One final word about the December quarter before I hand over to Tim. I'm very pleased with the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved across our entire business. There are many moving parts in the remainder of fiscal 2015, but I am confident that we will meet our objectives for the year. Meeting our financial and operational goals is only one dimension of success, however. It is a combination of unmatched execution and bold innovative thinking that really drives long-term value. So I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations while creatively looking forward to the future. The strength of our core business gives us a powerful platform upon which to build, and that gives me great confidence that we will continue to make new and vital contributions to the marketplace, and thereby continue to provide excellent returns to our shareholders. 
Now here is Tim."

As Steve mentioned, we're off to an excellent start for fiscal '15. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are the fi",2100,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we're off to an excellent start for fiscal '15. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are the first quarter ended December 2014 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have 2 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap first quarter consolidated and segment performance; and second, I will cover our revised fiscal '15 expectations. 
With that, we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 15%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continues to drive our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix and positive trends in the industry. As a reminder, this marks the first quarter that we had the Walgreens generic volume for all stores for the entire quarter. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for slightly over half of our 15% revenue growth. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 24% to $896 million. The growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth on both brand and generics. Also, we continue to benefit from a strong manufacturer pricing environment. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased 15% to $461 million. Expense increase correlated with a large revenue increase in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Consistent with past quarters, the increase in expenses were primarily related to distributions on our labor expense, delivery cost and depreciation of capital assets to support the business ramp. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $436 million, up about $130 million or a very strong 35% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.30%, up 19 basis points. Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $15 million, down about 19% due primarily to the refinancing of debt which we completed last year. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 37.9% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. Looking out for the full year, we still expect our tax rate to be about 37% driven by growth in our international businesses. And for the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 43% to $1.14, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was 229 million shares, down roughly 3%. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $33 billion, up 15%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company led the way with a 15% revenue increase. Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 4 items. One, as I mentioned earlier, we reached full delivery of all generic drugs to all Walgreens locations for the full quarter; two, our sales to Walgreens exceeded our expectations, especially generics; and three, we continue to see the revenue benefit from the uptake in hepatitis C drugs, these drugs accounted for roughly 1/3 of the drug company's total revenue growth; and then finally, four, overall market growth, driven by volume and strong pricing. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 26%. It is widely reported 2 manufacturers shifted certain infused oncology drugs from full line distribution to specialty distribution. Excluding this shift, our specialty business still grew an impressive 17%, with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We also had very good growth in our community oncology business, driven by positive pricing trends and some new business. Finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth due to new business wins, volume growth with existing manufacturer customers. The sales growth percentages for the drug company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations consistent with how we reported these growth rates in the past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $752 million, up $158 million or about 27%. Drug company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth. And in both drug and specialty, we experienced better-than-expected brand and generic price appreciation. This segment did see better-than-expected gross profit from a late flu season and also the continued growth of our private label program, BluePoint. Operating expenses were $362 million and were up about 18%. As I mentioned previously, expense increase was primarily due to supporting of the segment's significant volume growth. As an example, our drug company shipped roughly 2x the number of units this quarter compared to last year. As a result of being fully ramped now with Walgreens generic volume, growth in the Walgreens business and growth from our other customer accounts. Segment operating income was $390 million and up about 36%, driven by the outstanding performance of the drug company. As Steve highlighted, we're also extremely pleased with our specialty business and the fast start they had. Then operating income growth rate in the mid-teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services and World Courier. In the quarter, segment revenues increased $92 million or about 15% to $696 million. Roughly 60% of the segment's revenue dollar growth came from TheraCom, our distribution business within consulting. We did experience a very good growth rate in our core consulting business in the teams due to the start of several new manufacturer programs and organic growth in existing programs. World Courier also had solid revenue growth, however, their revenue growth was somewhat dampened by foreign currency exchange rates. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $45 million, reflecting growth of 26%. Consulting and World Courier each contributed about equally to the income growth. Consulting contributed primarily to top line growth. World Courier contributed through a combination of top line growth and expense management. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and quickly cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants increased about $600 million through approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, correlated to the increase in the ABC share price for the same period. This resulted in a total expense of $371 million for the quarter. About 80% of this expense is the retroactive adjustment needed to properly report expense through the 8 quarters we've had the warrants outstanding. 
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expensive $144 million which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year LIFO expense was estimated using 2 key assumptions. One, price inflation remains at the same levels for both branded generics, as what we experienced last year; and two, we are forecasting a higher inventory balance at year end due to overall business growth versus our previous year end. These assumptions are driving the large expected full year LIFO expense. And we will, of course, update our assumptions moving forward each quarter. 
This wraps up our P&L review. I'd like to now cover working capital and cash flow items. This quarter, we had terrific cash flow, $840 million. We are clearly benefiting from the growth in our generic drug volumes which have much better payable terms, specifically our DPO or days payable to suppliers, improved nearly 6 days from last year. Again, this reflects a larger mix of our business being generics. Our free cash flow also benefited from a onetime reduction in inventory of about $150 million in the closing of our old Florida distribution center. The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks. Through the quarter, our regular share buybacks were $132 million. We ended the quarter with $443 million available on our regular share repurchase authorization. We also purchased the same dollar amount under our special share repurchase program. And as a reminder, these shares are specifically designated to offset expected dilution from the warrants and are not included in our adjusted share count. We ended the quarter with $266 million available on our special share authorization. 
During the quarter, we also took steps to improve our warrant hedging position. We partnered with a bank to increase the ceilings specifically on our 2016 cap calls given the increase in our share price. As a result, we have incurred a liability of about $78 million through December 31. We finished the program in mid-January at a total cost of $100 million. And as a reminder, there's no P&L impact in connection with our hedging program. 
Now let's turn to our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My initial guidance comments that I will cover this morning exclude the impact from the MWI transaction so you have a better comparable to the guidance we provided back in late October. At the very end, I will make a few comments about the impact to guidance with MWI included. Revenues. Based on positive trends in our business and the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 10% to 11% range. 
Gross profit. Let me comment on 2 specific items within gross profit. The first will be generic price appreciation. As I mentioned earlier, generic price inflation was better-than-expected in our first quarter. While the trend in the past several quarters is for manufacturers to raise prices in the first month of the quarter, so far in January, we haven't seen much activity in this area. Therefore, nearly 4 months into our fiscal year, we are not changing our full year assumption. We are confident that our annual expectation will be met, which is flat dollars compared to last year. The second item is generic drug launches. There has been recent news about generic Nexium entering the market. At this point, there are still many open questions about the launch, including when product will be available, how quickly the FDA will approve other manufacturers who have filed ANDAs, the timing of those launches, the ability of manufacturers to produce enough product to cover the large market and the impact of potential court actions. At this point, we do not expect the launch of generic Nexium to be as beneficial as we originally expected. Therefore, we have lowered our assumption in the gross contribution from this item, especially in the second half of the year. 
Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be 9% to 11%, driven by our first quarter performance and higher anticipated full year revenue growth. However, the change in our generic Nexium contribution assumption that I just called out is a partial offset to income growth. 
Operating margin. We now expect our operating margin to be relatively flat in fiscal '15. This is due primarily to higher brand drug revenues, including the continued growth in hepatitis C drugs. Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% from last year's adjusted EPS. Importantly, as you think about our EPS quarterly progression, we now expect that our combined adjusted EPS in the first half of the fiscal year will be slightly greater than the combined adjusted EPS in our second half. 
Share repurchases. Our revised guidance for regular share repurchases is $200 million for the full year, down from previous guidance due to cash that will be used in conjunction with the MWI closing. We remain committed to $400 million in special share repurchases for the full year. 
Switching to our free cash flow guidance. The better growth in generic revenues and generics having significantly better working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As I highlighted, assuming that we successfully close the MWI transaction in the March quarter, we will provide more detailed guidance on our April earnings call. For today's call, we will reiterate that MWI will add an incremental $0.08 to our adjusted EPS spread evenly between our June and September quarters. This means that our guidance range, including the contribution from MWI, will be $4.53 to $4.63. 
So in summary, 1 quarter doesn't make a year. We have a long way to go, but we are off to a great start. Our commitment is that we will continue to work hard servicing our customers. We will deploy capital properly and we will make the right decisions to grow our business for the long run. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

So everyone really understands how the treatment is being conducted and it's being conducted at the highest of standards.

But it's not where it was. So I think with the impacts of the ASP change and the sequestration, the market's properly stabilized, those who are going to sell or those who are going to merge with another larger practice in the area may have done that. We didn't have an Investor Day in December but oncology business, it's -- we have the oncology supply and ion business which is a big part of specialty, but even within ASD, for example, which is primarily non-core distribution to hospitals is a big oncology segment because they do a lot of the oral oncology programs to ultimate care mail order, specialty pharmacy. So it's complex, but oncology permeates not only our specialty business, but more and more of our health systems distribution business. And also our manufacturer services business, so much of it in the reimbursement and patient programs business. Even the World Courier clinical trial, so much of it is oncology. So we've always been very proud of the oncology franchise AmerisourceBergen has. And it's getting harder and harder to put it into discrete buckets.

And then we have our ProGen formulary which contracts with WBAD. But our goal there is to have competitive pricing everyday but also make sure that there's continuity of supply because, again, if any product that our customers and ultimately their patients can't access is very debilitating to patient care. So we focus both on price and on quality, and I think ABC does a great job. I can tell you, we're adding more and more resources into this kind of business intelligence area to make sure that we have the pricing quality that our customers are demanding. So I don't have a perfect answer. I just will tell you that it always is of great fascination to me, I think that's the right word, how dynamic the generic business is. The pricing, ins and outs, changes, what goes on now with patents is becoming more and more obtuse. Nexium is another great example of how difficult this has been to forecast. So I just would say it's a very dynamic market. I think our customers are giving us good adherence. We're getting good compliance. It can always be better. We're not happy, we like it to be even higher. This is something that we pay attention to if not on a daily basis, virtually on a daily basis. This is Tim's favorite here. I think he's involved with the generic guys all the time. So this is something that is of great fascination and I think it's a very strong area for ABC and it's probably one of the key areas of opportunity, but also where we've done very well with the partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance."

Since then, we've had a good resumption of dialogue with Walgreens Boots Alliance at the top level because we -- obviously, they had a lot going on in the last 2 or 3 quarters. So we're very positive about the opportunities. I think Ornella and I served on the IPW board for many years together. She's extremely experienced, Alphega has over 7,000 community pharmacy members. So our Good Neighbor Pharmacy is about 4,500. We think that there's an opportunity on contracting. We think the private label, Almus is something we're working hard on. You would expect that we should have more clarity over the next couple of quarters, but it's a great passion for Ornella, it's a great passion for ABC and we are really proud of how well BluePoint has done and I think it's paved the way for a stronger private label offering for the combined family of companies as we look at our market position.

In fact, our new AmerisourceBergen Bern, Switzerland office, this is an area of great promise. And also Walgreens has a strong specialty presence. So we think -- and our whole system business. So this is a natural area for us. Other areas we could look at is the 3PL. Tim highlighted earlier the success of ICS. There certainly are comparable offerings on the Alliance wholesale side which seems that there could be a much stronger bond there and a much stronger offering, which we have worked on.

I mean they probably added 3% to 4%. And we don't see these based on the last quarter on adoption of Olysio and the new therapies, we just don't see that backing off. It's very strong segment for us and our customers. And I met with one of our customers recently and they said to me -- I said, ""What can we do a better job?"" They said, ""We need more credit for our stores."" Because they're doing more and more hep C patients and you get a couple of hep C patients and it totally changes the dynamic. So the market is robust. I think we do go manual for IMS forecast. So -- I forget what exactly the latest forecast they have for this year is, but pretty it's healthy out there. Frankly, Lisa, just not to change gears on you but -- and we are very interested in development internationally, particularly on our specialty franchise, and we're seeing some progress in Brazil with our specialty JV, although the problems in the Brazilian overall retail market and the economy are well noted. But it's just one of the great things about MWI is how strong the U.S. business is. It's such a good mix there and we see such strong trends in the U.S. vet market.

So we're going to be working with countries that we're very used to working with, the top 4 or 5 global manufacturers. They're used to buying services from AmerisourceBergen and from our type or class of trade. And then a lot of the key products will be physician-administered products. So this is an area of strength for us. We know how to work on the pricing issues, on the market acceptance issues, on the contracting issues, on the reimbursement issues. This is -- I was out in Washington a couple of weeks ago, it's a question we're getting asked by regulators a lot more. So we think that the pricing environment will be favorable for the type of services that AmerisourceBergen offers to manufacturers. And also it will be of interest to our customers.

As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen Associates delivered excellent financial results in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $33.6 billion. Our adjuste",2017,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen Associates delivered excellent financial results in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $33.6 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 42% to $1.14 while we generated a very strong $900 million in operating cash flow. One of the most gratifying aspects of this quarter's results is that it was driven by strong performance from virtually every one of our businesses. The strength of these core business positions and offerings, combined with our disciplined capital management, gives us the flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we make plans to broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings to a new market segment. 
Earlier in January, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire MWI Veterinary Supply, a premier animal health distributor, for $2.5 billion in cash. We commenced this tender offer for all outstanding shares of MWI on January 26, and we expect to close the transaction during the March quarter. As I said when we first announced the deal, ABC has delivered significant growth and shareholder value by staying focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain where we have developed unparalleled knowledge and expertise and by bringing a collaborative philosophy to all of our relationships. Jim Cleary and his team at MWI will be ideal partners with whom to build on that foundation and extend our reach into the growing global animal health sector. MWI is already well respected for their great success since the company was founded in 1976 and went public in 2005, but we believe that by combining MWI's legacy of success and innovation with ABC's relevant experience in manufacturer and provider services and our global reach, we will create a compelling opportunity to launch the next generation of superior animal health products and services. I'm very excited about the future contributions that Jim and his team will make to AmerisourceBergen and about the potential for growth that we see ahead. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the December quarter. Overall, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2015, and we have set ourselves up well to meet our strategic and updated financial objectives for the full year. Turning on the momentum as we had -- as we exited fiscal 2014, our performance in the first quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth, and a significant improvement in working capital led to stellar cash flow, especially for a December quarter. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. Last quarter, I noted that our individual business units continuously became less distinct from one another by focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our ability to achieve comprehensive enterprise-wide solutions is particularly valuable in a fast-changing market and is a key driver of our results. Many of these solutions are, of course, in the specialty area, where the unique combination of services and expertise we offer helps manufacturers and customers manage the challenges of the fast-growing area of the market. Just as specialty products now permeate nearly every segment of our business, discussions about opportunities within the specialty realm are top of mind for virtually all of our customers. We believe we are the best position to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products for manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter with revenues up 15% even as we anniversary-ed the first full quarter of the Walgreens brand business. Overall market growth trends remain quite good and a strong flu season was clearly helpful to our overall retail and vaccine sales numbers. The December quarter was the first full quarter where we had all of the brand and generic business from Walgreens, and we are very pleased to have the distribution contract fully implemented. Good organic growth overcame the rolloff of some old business, and sales of the new hepatitis C drug class also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall drug pricing trends remain quite favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy customers are benefiting from favorable market conditions as well as some ABC-specific programs, including those that improve independent retail pharmacies' access to specialty products such as the new hepatitis C drugs and other therapies. Our diverse customer base helps us ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long-established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships ensured our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. 
During the quarter, we continued to reap the benefits of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance in both the distribution to Walgreens stores and the contribution from the sourcing joint venture. We are very pleased with the progress the JV has made to-date, and going forward, we will work collaboratively to ensure the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers. In addition, we have made significant progress in our BluePoint private label program and in ramping up activities in ABC Switzerland. All of these activities are demonstrative of the value that wholesellers bring to the supply chain and of the specific innovations AmerisourceBergen brings to the table. 
During the quarter, we officially opened our national distribution center in Columbus. This state-of-the-art facility helps drive logistics and inventory management efficiency for both ABC and our manufacture partners. This and other investments we have made and continue to make in our infrastructure enable us to meaningfully enhance our services and strengthen our ability to grow our business over the long term. ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing posed changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG's revenues were up 17%. Our physician distribution business performed very well, and ASD was particularly strong in the December quarter. Given my long history with our community oncology business and our confidence in our offerings in this area, it is especially gratifying to report that our community oncology business grew ahead of expectations in the December quarter. This was due to a mix of new business, some earlier than expected price increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persist and sales of practices to help systems continue, although at a slower rate, we are hopefully seeing stabilization on the community oncology market, which is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology treatments will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well positioned to ensure that our customers remain in the forefront of the evolution of cancer care. 
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a strong quarter with both Consulting Services and World Courier performing very well. The unrivaled service offerings in this area are of keen interest to both our manufacturer and provider customers and a key driver of value as the cost and complexity of medication therapies increase. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy area, along with our experience in developing patient access and adherence programs is a clear differentiator today and an opportunity for growth in the future, particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market. Our knowledge base combined with the immense scale of our distribution businesses and our increasingly global reach make us the ideal partner for those who want to be in the position to lead the next evolutionary change in health care. 
As I've said many times, it is an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. Our R&D pipeline is full of innovative products that hold the potential to make great strides across many disease states [ph]. The combination of advanced therapeutic medicine and expanding access to health care drives growth opportunities and, more importantly, meaningfully improves patient lives. Many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. As Americans age, pet ownership is increasing, and pets themselves are living longer. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining pet health. In addition, the increasingly global demand for protein drives demands on the production side of the market. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding the transaction, and we firmly believe that MWI is a premier distributor in these 2 areas of business focus, and we are very excited to add animal health to our portfolio of services. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Generic inflation was strong in the December quarter but has been modest so far in January. We also had some brand price increases in December that we had been expecting to see in January, particularly in specialty. As a result, we expect that the contribution from generic inflation will be flat in the remaining quarters versus last year and that brand inflation will remain strong. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium approved by the FDA, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the timing of the launch of the product into the marketplace and the extent to which there will be competition between manufacturers of the generic. Given these trends and our performance in the December quarter, we have raised our guidance for the remainder of the year in a few key areas. Tim will provide greater detail, but in summary, on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 11%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 12% to 15%, free cash flow generation in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As a result of cash figures in part to fund the MWI transaction, we've reduced the amount of share repurchases we expect to complete in fiscal 2015 and our regular share repurchase program to $200 million. But we will complete $400 million of repurchases under the special program as we have previously discussed. 
Another noteworthy event for AmerisourceBergen was the January 16 announcement that Ornella Barra had joined our board. Ornella is one of the most experienced wholesale executives in our global industry. Ornella is a pharmacist by profession and has long championed the role of global community pharmacy through the well-regarded Alphega network of pharmacies. Ms. Barra currently serves as Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President and Chief Executive of Global Wholesale and International Retail. We look forward to Ornella's participation on our board. 
One final word about the December quarter before I hand over to Tim. I'm very pleased with the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved across our entire business. There are many moving parts in the remainder of fiscal 2015, but I'm confident that we will meet our objectives for the year. Meeting our financial and operational goals is only one dimension of success, however. It is a combination of unmatched execution and bold innovative thinking that really drives long-term value. So I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations while creatively looking forward to the future. The strength of our core business gives us a powerful platform upon which to build, and that gives me great confidence that we will continue to make new and vital contributions to the marketplace, and thereby, continue to provide excellent returns to our shareholders. 
Now here is Tim."

As Steve mentioned, we're off to an excellent start for fiscal '15. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are the fi",2106,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we're off to an excellent start for fiscal '15. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are the first quarter ended December 2014 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have 2 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap first quarter consolidated and segment performance; and second, I will cover our revised fiscal '15 expectations. 
With that, we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 15%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continued to drive our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix and positive trends in the industry. As a reminder, this marks the first quarter that we had the Walgreens generic volume for all stores for the entire quarter. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for slightly over half of our 15% revenue growth. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 24% to $896 million. The growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth on both brand and generics. Also, we continue to benefit from a strong manufacturer pricing environment. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased 15% to $461 million. The expense increase correlated with a large revenue increase in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Consistent with past quarters, the increase in expenses were primarily related to distributions on our labor expense, delivery cost and depreciation of capital assets to support the business ramp. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $436 million, up about $113 million or a very strong 35% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.30%, up 19 basis points. Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $15 million, down about 19% due primarily to the refinancing of debt which we completed last year. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 37.9% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. Looking out for the full year, we still expect our tax rate to be about 37% driven by growth in our international businesses. And for the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 43% to $1.14 driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was 229 million shares, down roughly 3%. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. And let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $33 billion, up 15%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company led the way with a 15% revenue increase. Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 4 items. One, as I mentioned earlier, we reached full delivery of all generic drugs to all Walgreens locations for the full quarter; two, our sales to Walgreens exceeded our expectations, especially generics; and three, we continued to see the revenue benefit from the uptake in hepatitis C drugs. These drugs accounted for roughly 1/3 of the drug company's total revenue growth; and then finally, four, overall market growth driven by volume and strong pricing. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 26%. As widely reported, 2 manufacturers shifted certain infused oncology drugs from full line distribution to specialty distribution. Excluding this shift, our specialty business still grew an impressive 17% with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We also had very good growth in our community oncology business driven by positive pricing trends and some new business. Finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth due to new business wins and volume growth with existing manufacturer customers. The sales growth percentages for the drug company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations consistent with how we've reported these growth rates in the past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $752 million, up $158 million or about 27%. Drug company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth. And in both drug and specialty, we experienced better-than-expected brand and generic price appreciation. This segment did see better-than-expected gross profit from a late flu season and also the continued growth of our private label program, BluePoint. Operating expenses were $362 million and were up about 18%. As I mentioned previously, expense increase was primarily due to supporting of the segment's significant volume growth. As an example, our drug company shipped roughly 2x the number of units this quarter compared to last year as a result of being fully ramped now with Walgreens generic volume, growth in the Walgreens business and growth from our other customer accounts. Segment operating income was $390 million and up about 36% driven by the outstanding performance of the drug company. As Steve highlighted, we're also extremely pleased with our specialty business and the fast start they had with an operating income growth rate in the mid-teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services and World Courier. In the quarter, segment revenues increased $92 million or about 15% to $696 million. Roughly 60% of the segment's revenue dollar growth came from TheraCom, our distribution business within consulting. We did experience a very good growth rate in our core consulting business in the teams due to the start of several new manufacturer programs and organic growth in existing programs. World Courier also had solid revenue growth, however, their revenue growth was somewhat dampened by foreign currency exchange rates. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $45 million reflecting growth of 26%. Consulting and World Courier each contributed about equally to the income growth. Consulting contributed primarily to top line growth. World Courier contributed through a combination of top line growth and expense management. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and quickly cover our 2 large GAAP items: warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants increased about $600 million to approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, correlated to the increase in the ABC share price for the same period. This resulted in a total expense of $371 million for the quarter. About 80% of this expense is the retroactive adjustment needed to properly report expense through the 8 quarters we've had the warrants outstanding. 
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expense of $144 million, which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year LIFO expense was estimated using 2 key assumptions. One, price inflation remains at the same levels for both branded generics as what we experienced last year; and two, we are forecasting a higher inventory balance at year end due to overall business growth versus our previous year end. These assumptions are driving the large expected full year LIFO expense. And we will, of course, update our assumptions moving forward each quarter. 
This wraps up our P&L review. I'd like to now cover working capital and cash flow items. This quarter, we had terrific cash flow: $840 million. We are clearly benefiting from the growth in our generic drug volumes, which have much better payable terms, specifically our DPO, or days payable to suppliers, improved nearly 6 days from last year. Again, this reflects a larger mix of our business being generics. Our free cash flow also benefited from a onetime reduction in inventory of about $150 million from the closing of our old Florida distribution center. The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks. Through the quarter, our regular share buybacks were $132 million. We ended the quarter with $443 million available on our regular share repurchase authorization. We also purchased the same dollar amount under our special share repurchase program. And as a reminder, these shares are specifically designated to offset expected dilution from the warrants and are not included in our adjusted share count. We ended the quarter with $266 million available on our special share authorization. 
During the quarter, we also took steps to improve our warrant hedging position. We partnered with a bank to increase the ceilings specifically on our 2016 cap calls given the increase in our share price. As a result, we incurred a liability of about $78 million through December 31. We finished the program in mid-January at a total cost of $100 million. And as a reminder, there's no P&L impact in connection with our hedging program. 
Now let's turn to our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My initial guidance comments that I will cover this morning exclude the impact from the MWI transaction so you have a better comparable to the guidance we provided back in late October. At the very end, I will make a few comments about the impact to guidance with MWI included. Revenues. Based on positive trends in our business and the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 10% to 11% range. 
Gross profit. Let me comment on 2 specific items within gross profit. The first will be generic price appreciation. As I mentioned earlier, generic price inflation was better than expected in our first quarter. While the trend in the past several quarters is for manufacturers to raise prices in the first month of the quarter, so far in January, we haven't seen much activity in this area. Therefore, nearly 4 months into our fiscal year, we are not changing our full year assumption. We are confident that our annual expectation will be met, which is flat dollars compared to last year. The second item is generic drug launches. There has been recent news about generic Nexium entering the market. At this point, there are still many open questions about the launch, including when product will be available, how quickly the FDA will approve other manufacturers who have filed ANDAs, the timing of those launches, the ability of manufacturers to produce enough product to cover the large market and the impact of potential court actions. At this point, we do not expect the launch of generic Nexium to be as beneficial as we originally expected. Therefore, we have lowered our assumption in the gross profit contribution from this item, especially in the second half of the year. 
Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be 9% to 11% driven by our first quarter performance and higher anticipated full year revenue growth. However, the change in our generic Nexium contribution assumption that I just called out is a partial offset to income growth. 
Operating margin. We now expect our operating margin to be relatively flat in fiscal '15. This is due primarily to higher brand drug revenues, including the continued growth in hepatitis C drugs. 
Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% from last year's adjusted EPS. Importantly, as you think about our EPS quarterly progression, we now expect that our combined adjusted EPS in the first half of the fiscal year will be slightly greater than the combined adjusted EPS in our second half. 
Share repurchases. Our revised guidance for regular share repurchases is $200 million for the full year, down from previous guidance due to cash that will be used in conjunction with the MWI closing. We remain committed to $400 million in special share repurchases for the full year. 
Switching to our free cash flow guidance. With better growth in generic revenues and generics having significantly better working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As I highlighted, assuming that we successfully close the MWI transaction in the March quarter, we will provide more detailed guidance on our April earnings call. For today's call, we will reiterate that MWI will add an incremental $0.08 to our adjusted EPS spread evenly between our June and September quarters. This means that our guidance range, including the contribution from MWI, will be $4.53 to $4.63. 
So in summary, 1 quarter doesn't make a year. We have a long way to go, but we are off to a great start. Our commitment is that we will continue to work hard servicing our customers. We will deploy capital properly, and we will make the right decisions to grow our business for the long run. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

So there are various benefits. Essentially, the manufacturers that we're talking about are working with many participants in the supply channel, and we'll end up with a very big share of the health systems market which is certainly around the mid-30s. We'll end up servicing many of our own customers internally.

So everyone really understands how the treatment is being conducted, that it's being conducted at the highest of standards.

It's such a big brand drug that we thought it was going to be a big positive second half. We do slow it down a bit. We start to anniversary more of that Walgreens business revenue the second half of the year. And also the WBAD contribution, we start to anniversary that the second half of the year. That's why I think a little bit of my discussion of guidance we think we'll be a little bit heavier weighted to the first half than the second half."

But it's not where it was. So I think with the impacts of the ASP change and the sequestration, the market's probably stabilized, those who were going to sell or those who were going to merge with another larger practice in the area may have done that. We didn't have an Investor Day in December but oncology business, it's -- we have the oncology supply and ION business, which is a big part of specialty, but even within ASD, for example, which is primarily noncore distribution to hospitals, is a big oncology segment because they do a lot of the oral oncology programs to ultimate care mail order, specialty pharmacy. So it's complex, but oncology permeates not only our specialty business, but more and more of our health systems distribution business. And also our manufacturer services business, so much of it in the reimbursement and patient programs business. Even the World Courier clinical trial, so much of it is oncology. So we've always been proud of oncology franchise AmerisourceBergen has. And it's getting harder and harder to put it into discrete buckets. It truly is a business that permeates the whole of AmerisourceBergen. Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything to that."

But also, we talked earlier about the hepatitis drugs. So again, I think the generic profile we have, it's worth mentioning we have our other generic portfolio where we service contracts on behalf of our customers, and this is important business for us, and the largest player in that by far is Walgreens. And then we have our ProGen formulary which contracts with WBAD. But our goal there is to have competitive pricing every day but also make sure that there's continuity of supply because, again, if there are any products that our customers and ultimately their patients can't access, this is very debilitating to patient care. So we focus both on price and on quality, and I think ABC does a great job. I can tell you, we're adding more and more resources into this kind of business intelligence area to make sure that we have the pricing quality that our customers are demanding. So I don't have a perfect answer. I just will tell you that it always is of great fascination to me, I think that's the right word, how dynamic the generic business is. The pricing, ins and outs, changes, what goes on now with patents is becoming more and more obtuse. [indiscernible] Nexium is another great example of how difficult this has been to forecast. So I just would say it's a very dynamic market. I think our customers are giving us good adherence. We're getting good compliance. It can always be better. We're not happy. We'd like it to be even higher. This is something that we pay attention to if not on a daily basis, virtually on a daily basis. This is Tim's favorite area. I think he's involved with the generic guys all the time. So this is something that is of great fascination, and I think it's a very strong area for ABC, and it's probably one of the key areas of opportunity, but also where we've done very well with the partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance."

As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered outstanding financial results in our second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $32.7 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 36% to $1.45 while we generated a very strong $700 million in operating cash flow. In addition to the exited financial and operating performance, we also made important progress against our strategic objectives as we close of acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and we extended our contract with a PBM customer for an additional year. The strength of our core business combined with our discipline capital management adds up flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings through new market segments and continue to drive innovation across the pharmaceutical supply channel. We've had exceptional first half of fiscal 2015, and we are very well-positioned to meet our increased expectations for the full year. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the March quarter. Holding on the momentum we had coming out of our first quarter, our performance in the second quarter was very robust, but strong revenue growth, combined with operating leverage, both exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth and continuing improvement in working capital led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter, with revenues up 13% even as we continue to anniversary the Walgreens brand business and some of the generic business. Good organic growth rates will contain the roll off of some old business and sales of the new hepatitis C drugs also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall, direct pricing trends remain favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy, chains, health system and ultimate customers all performed well in the quarter. Our diverse customer base helps us ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long-established products. 
Our extensive manufacturer relationships help ensure our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. This throughput is a tremendous strategic and technical value, both for those launching new products and for those providing daily care to patients. We have a trusted partner that has a key role in improving patient access to pharmaceuticals, is critical in the health care system and is rapidly evolving with each passing day. Having a partner who works collaboratively to maximize efficiency and reach is essential in the market with increasing demand and decreasing resources. Our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is progressing very well. Sales of brand and generic products to Walgreens stores are growing faster than expected and we are very pleased with economic contributions on the sourcing JV. Our relationship evolves along with the markets we both serve, and we are continuously working collaboratively and the enhancement to bring to manufacturers and the program and services we bring to our customers. On the international front in our direct distribution business, our Blue Point profit label program is performing well, and we achieved an important milestone this quarter as we launched our first generic injectable product under the Blue Point level. Activities of ABDC Switzerland are well underway and are beginning to contribute value to both ABC and to the manufacturers we serve. ABC Switzerland functions as an intermediary for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturers, managing strategic relationships and fostering specific new value-added activities. It provides enhanced data analytics and market intelligence to assist manufacturers with their supply chain effectiveness and serve as a platform to manage and grow progenerics, our proprietary generics formulary and other global generic programs. Moreover, the location and time zone of ABC Switzerland takes coordination and activity with our partners [indiscernible]. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we have expanded our international presence by improving the services we offer our partners. 
In the U.S., and we continue to ramp activity at our national distribution center in Columbus. We have more than doubled the volume going to the facility during the March quarter and we will continue to add additional manufacturers to this program over the remainder of the fiscal year. All of these activities are great examples of new efficiencies and innovations that wholesalers bring to the supply chain and of the specific value AmerisourceBergen brings to the table. ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter, the number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing produce changes in certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from drug companies to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 16%. Our addition distribution business performs very well and ASG is again particularly strong in the March quarter. Our community oncology business performed well in the March quarter due to a mix of new business and brand oncology product price increases and overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persist, we are very pleased that the community oncology market stabilized, which we believe is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology care will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well-positioned to ensure that our customers remain at the forefront of cancer care. I have also noted that our individual business units increasingly become less distinct from one another while focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our leadership team is focused on achieving enterprise-wide solutions and will impact our customers and enhance our competitive position. This way is more evident than in the services area with a unique combination of services and expertise we offer, both manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunity and challenges of this dynamic segment of the market. We have spent virtually decades helping developing our portfolio of specialty offerings and building up the capabilities in industry to handle complex products with special needs. We spend well beyond sophisticated logistics and enter the distinct requirements with specific disease states and unique classes of products. We definitely meet the needs of physicians and health systems, and we acquire the development of commercialization and reimbursement consulting services and patient access and adherence programs. One of the work would've done and investments would've made in our facilities, our people and our technology has been done in an effort to collaboratively meet the need of biotech innovators, establish pharmaceutical companies and the physician and other providers to administer this life-changing therapies, which positively impacts the lives of the patients we all ultimately serve. 
Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biological product, a generic version of [indiscernible] therapy with promising growth areas such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the unique expertise and the right portfolio required to help ensure the widest market for our product, greatest patient access and the most [indiscernible] support of services, all conducted in an extremely efficient manner that generates tremendous value for all stakeholders. Our consolidation and the economic realities of health reform make us even more focused on the specialty product segments. I never felt more confident that AmerisourceBergen is the best positioned partner for our various stakeholders to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. 
Now let me say a few words about biosimilars specifically, which are understandably generating a great deal of attention. We believe that the introduction of biosimilars to U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further demonstrate our strengths in these areas. While we currently serve the timing of biosimilar introductions and many other questions still remain regarding the pricing of products, the degree of substitutability and the specific mechanisms of reimbursement, we are looking forward to working with our partners to ensure that patients will be the ultimate beneficiary of the introduction of biosimilars. We have the widest access possible to these products. The majority of the benefits from biosimilars are still [indiscernible], but we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new category of product. 
As we look ahead, we are thrilled to extend the distribution and specialty expertise we have accumulated into the animal health space. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the MWI transaction late February and we are pleased officially welcome Jim Terry, Mary Thompson and the rest of the MWI team to AmerisourceBergen. Jim is now a member of my executive lead team and the integration is off to a terrific start. Our results in this quarter include about 1 month of MWI's results, which were ahead of our expectations. We remain quite confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance, and that we will meet our targets for synergy capture as planned. MWI's results are now reported under our Other segment, along with our Consulting business and World Courier. 
Coincidentally, today marks the third year anniversary since we closed our World Courier transaction. World Courier has helped us think globally and we have together exceeded so many of the integration and strategic goals we laid out in our business case. Congratulations to all the associates at World Courier on the third anniversary of joining AmerisourceBergen. 
All the manufacture services businesses together had a solid March quarter. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and quality areas, our increasingly global reach and our experience in developing patients access and adherence program is the differentiator for AmerisourceBergen today and an opportunity for growth in the future particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market. 
It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. The combination of a pipeline full of innovative products and expanding access to health care drives meaningful improvement in patients' lives and growth opportunities epos of the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we have previously discussed, many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. [indiscernible] in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. As Americans age, pet ownership is increasing and pets themselves are living longer, thanks to improvements in pharmaceutical care and advance procedures that enhance the lives of pets. In addition, the increasing global demand for food drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has garnered in the U.S. and to developing global markets. Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while [indiscernible] in specific areas will moderate. Our year-over-year comparisons are much more difficult in the next 2 quarters, while our underlying business trends remain strong. For example, as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will gradually begin to fully anniversary the benefits from the Walgreens Generic business and the contributions from the sourcing joint venture. In addition, we need a substantial amount of generic inflation in the next 2 quarters just to match what we spent in the prior year. Brand inflation has been quite strong in the first 2 quarters of 2015, and we are seeing some brand pricing increases on specialty products that likely won't recur in the second half of the year. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic launch in the March quarter, there remains only one generic supplier. So the economic value of the product for ABC is not optimal. 
Given this strength. Our performance in the March quarter and the addition of MWI, we have raised our guidance for the remainder of the year. Tim will provide greater detail, but in summary, and on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 12% to 13%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 22% to 25% and free cash flow generation in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
As we reported in our press release this morning, our board has authorized a new $1 billion special share repurchase program designed to further offset the potential dilution from the future exercise of the warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance. As we approach the exercise dates on these warrants, we will continue to give value added to offset the dilutive impact of exercise and explore a variety of approaches to offset the diluted impact of exercises -- I beg your pardon, a strong variety of approaches to achieve our desired outcome, including through possible M&A. In addition to activity under the special program, we continue to expect to repurchase $200 million under our normal repurchase program. 
I'm very pleased with the outstanding financial and operating performance we achieved across our entire business in the first half of fiscal 2015. While there are many moving parts in the remainder of the year, I am confident that we will meet our financial and operational objectives for the year. As I said last quarter, generating strong business results requires more than meeting financial and operating goals. True value creation results from stellar execution, innovative thinking and the bald implementation of new ideas. I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations by partnering with them by creating new ways to meet current and future challenges. The tremendous strength of our now expanded core business is on a powerful platform upon which to build and to make vital contributions to the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of human and animal customers and by so doing continue to provide excellent returns to our stakeholders.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our second fiscal quarter ended March 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment [indiscernible] performance. I will also cover our consolidated cash flow highlights. As Steve mentioned, this is our first period that our results include MWI, which essentially means one month of their activity. The second topic I will spend a few minutes covering our warrant hedging progress to date and the last topic I will cover, our revised fiscal '15 expectations. 
So with that, we can begin our Q2 review. Revenues were $32.7 billion, up nearly 15%. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for just under half of that revenue growth. This is our second quarter of having all of this business, meaning their brand and generic volumes for the entire quarters. So a majority of this customer growth is due to the year-over-year ramping of the business. I should highlight that the addition of MWI contributed about 1% to our overall growth rate. The quarter's adjusted profit increased 25% to just over $1 billion, the strong growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth, especially generics. 
Operating expenses, our total adjusted operating expenses increased about 18% to approximately $490 million. Excluding MWI, our operating expense growth would've been 11% and roughly 2% of this growth was related to compensation accruals needed due to our year-to-date performance versus our internal plan. Consistent with past quarters, the remaining expense growth relates to higher overall business volumes and IT expenses.  Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $553 million, up about $136 million or a very strong 33% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.69%, up 23 basis points. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $21 million and included $5.5 million of interest in fees associated with the MWI financing to roughly 5 weeks in the quarter. Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 35.7% for the current quarter, down for the prior year. Growth in World Courier, Blue Point private label and now our Switzerland Manufacturer Services business is causing a change in our U.S. to international income mix and is consequently lowering our consolidated tax rate. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 37%. For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 37% to $1.45, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230.4 million shares, down just under 2%. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $31.8 billion [ph], up 14%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company led the way with a 13% revenue increase. Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 3 items: market growth -- one, market growth continues to be good, driven by volume, strong pricing and the new hepatitis C drugs; two, our sales to our largest customer exceeded our expectations; and three, as mentioned before, we have and anniversary the full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize this revenue benefit. In terms of a mix, Drug Company's total generic revenues increased nearly 50% year-over-year in dollars. Our specialty business group had an overall business increase of about 25% and similar to last quarter, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues on a comparable basis, our specialty business grew an impressive 16%, with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We continue to see solid growth in our community oncology business with the percentage growth rate in the high single digits. And, finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth, contributing about 1/3 of the 16% comparable growth rate due to new business wins and increased volumes.  The sales drove percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations consistent with how we reported these growth rates in past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $849 million, up about 22%. Drug Company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result to their high revenue growth, and as I've called out especially due to higher generic revenues. In terms of total segment price appreciation, we ended the quarter higher than we expected in terms of dollar contribution. We were better-than-expected in the contributions for brand inflation, and it's more than offset being slightly lower on the prices from generic inflation. Operating expenses were $361 million and were up about 12%. As I mentioned previously, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting the segment significant volume growth. OpEx also includes the additional incentive compensation accrual, primarily related to strong performance of the 2 businesses in the segment. Segment operating income was $489 million and up about 31% driven by the outstanding performance of the Drug Company. As Steve highlighted, we are often extremely pleased with our specialty business with an operating income growth rate in the high teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and beginning in this quarter, MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $986 million, up 72%. Excluding the impact of MWI, the revenue growth would have been slightly less than 20%, with most of this coming from our consulting business and specifically, at TheraCom distribution business. MWI had a very good revenue month prime as a result of its companion animal business, positive trends in the industry, including new innovative drugs and increased visits to vet practices are driving high companion animal revenue growth. During this period, production animal revenues were up modestly, impacted primarily by cattle feed lot placement being down year-over-year. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $64 million reflecting growth of 47%. The segments benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. 
Let me highlight from a margin standpoint, MWI's margin was better this period versus what they've had historically did having a better mix of companion animal revenue. This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants, the fair value, the warrants increased significantly to $2.7 billion as of March 31. This increase in value was related to the 26% increase in the EVP share price during the March quarter. Our gap warrant expense was $753 million for the quarter and roughly 75% of this expense represented a cumulative adjustment as the accounting rules require featured record expenses SF $2.7 billion fair value was that the fair value back on the day one of warrants issuing. LIFO this quarter recorded in the expense of $151 million. This means on a year-to-date basis, we have recorded about half of our full year estimates to $586 million, which is slightly greater than our estimates for the first fiscal quarter. This wraps up our P&L review and let me switch and cover cash. This quarter, we again had very good free cash flow, $690 million. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues, about 50% year-over-year continue to drive improved working capital metrics. Specifically, our DPO or days payable to suppliers, improved about 6 days to last year. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.3 billion, which is very good considering we partially funded the MWI acquisition and also continued with our warrant hedging activity. 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our second topic, warrant hedging. As we talked investors, we're receiving a number of warrant question, especially now that the 1st of May 24 Walgreens Boots Alliance to exercise is less than a year away, March 2016. As a reminder, the this 2016 and 2017 warrants each represent an option to buy approximately 23 million shares. ABC will receive roughly $1.2 billion in proceeds at the time of each exercise. To date, we have used 3 strategies to offset the expected warrant dilution. The first strategy we entered into the original cap call that can be exercised by ABC in 2016 and 2017, we plan to use 16% [ph] of the warrant proceed to fund the exercise of these cash calls. The second strategy, we have repurchased 5.1 million shares to date under our special share repurchase program. The third strategy in the March 2015 quarter, we purchased call options for 6 million shares for $80 million. We have the right to exercise the option during designated time period between April 2015 and the end of October 2015. Funding these exercises will require the use of capital of approximately $570 million. The average strike price of the call options is $95. 
Let me switch gears and address warrant coverage. First, the 2016 warrants, at March 31, and based on our closing share price on that date, which was $113.67, the cap calls covered 47% of the expected dilution. Adding the 1.51 million shares arrived repurchased, we come about 70% hedged on the 2016 warrants. Now looking forward, and assuming we successfully exercise the call option representing 6 million shares, we move to 95% hedged. For the 2017 warrants, again, at March 31, and based on our closing share price on that date, the cap call covered 42% of the expected dilution. We have not completed any other share repurchases or hedging activity related to the 2017 warrants yet. To enable our investors to better track our coverage, as our share price changes, I'd like to highlight that for every $5 increase from our March 31 closing share price, our total hedging coverage on each warrant will decrease by about 2%. Likewise, if our share price decreases by $5, our total coverage will increase by about 2% on each warrant. As a reminder, premiums paid for call options are not expensed in our P&L. This directly impacts our equity account. And shares earmarked we're hedging are not included in our adjusted share count for EPS purposes. We will not ourselves to share counts when the shares are issued at the time of warrant exercise. 
So to summarize this section, ABC remains committed to offsetting expected dilution in our adjusted EPS from the warrant exercises. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital deployment, including repurchasing shares and other hedging activity as well as looking for other means to fill the EPS gap from the warrant dilution including strategic M&A. Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My guidance comments will now include MWI. Revenues based on positive trends in our business and also the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 12% to 13% range. MWI is expected to account for about 2% for this growth. Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be in the range of 19% to 21%, driven by our first-half performance, stronger full year revenues especially generics, and adding MWI. Operating margin. We now expect that our operating margin will be up 8 to 10 basis points due to the performance of our business and mix with MWI having a higher margin in our drug and specialty businesses. Our adjusted dilution share count for the full year  is expected to be down just under 1% due to exercises under employee stock compensation plan and reduced share buybacks. In fact, we expect our Q3 and Q4 adjusted share count to be higher on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which reflects growth of 22% to 25% from last year's adjusted EPS. As we have said in prior investor calls, even though the second half of the year will include the contribution from MWI, we have a very tough EPS comparable due to strong generic price depreciation last year. We also begin to anniversary the Walgreens contribution and our renewed contract with the Department of Defense starts with revised market pricing. 
Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases remains at $200 million for the full year. Switching to our free cash flow guidance. Due to the combination of strong generic revenue growth and generics having positive working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
I would like to make one final comment about share repurchases and our share count. Historically, we've committed to deploying $400 million to $500 million for share repurchases in a given year subject to market conditions and other uses of cash like M&A. While we had a much lower share price, we are able to both offset employee stock option exercises and reduce our overall share count. As a reference point, our employee stock exercises can be roughly 2% of our outstanding shares in a given year. Going forward, due to our current share price, we will be challenged to just keep our adjusted share count flat while deploying the same approximate dollars. 
As I wrap up, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. I've covered several key areas, and I hope you found this information helpful. At the halfway point of our fiscal year, we are executing very well. We are working to integrate our new business MWI and we are thrilled with progress to date and we remain committed to making the right long-term investment to continue to grow our earnings. 
Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered outstanding financial results in our second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $32.7 billion. Our adju",2343,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered outstanding financial results in our second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $32.7 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 36% to $1.45 while we generated a very strong $700 million in operating cash flow. In addition to the excellent financial and operating performance, we also made important progress against our strategic objectives as we closed of acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and we extended our contract with our large PBM customer for an additional year. 
The strength of our core business, combined with our disciplined capital management, gives us the flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings to new market segments and continue to drive innovation across the pharmaceutical supply channel. We've had an exceptional first half of fiscal 2015, and we are very well positioned to meet our increased expectations for the full year. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the March quarter. Holding on to momentum we had coming out of our first quarter, our performance in the second quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth, and continuing improvement in working capital led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter with revenues up 13% even as we continued to anniversary the Walgreens brand business and some of the generic business. Good organic growth rates overcame the roll-off of some old business, and sales of the new hepatitis C drugs also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall, direct pricing trends remain favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. 
We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health system and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Our diverse customer base helps us to ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long-established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships help ensure our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. This footprint is a tremendous strategic and technical value, both for those launching new products and for those providing daily care to patients. 
To have a trusted partner who has a key role in improving patient access to pharmaceuticals is critical in a health care system that is rapidly evolving with each passing day. And having a partner who works collaboratively to maximize efficiency and reach is essential in a market with increasing demand and decreasing resources. Our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is progressing very well. Sales of brand and generic products to Walgreens stores are growing faster than expected, and we are very pleased with the economic contributions from the sourcing JV. Our relationship evolves along with the markets we both serve, and we are continuously working collaboratively to enhance the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers. 
On the international front in our direct distribution business, our BluePoint private label program is performing well, and we achieved an important milestone this quarter as we launched our first generic injectable product under the BluePoint label. Activities in ABC Switzerland are well under way, and we -- and are beginning to contribute value to both ABC and to the manufacturers we serve. ABC Switzerland functions as an intermediary for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturers, managing strategic relationships and fostering specific new value-added activities. It provides enhanced data analytics and market intelligence to assist manufacturers with their supply chain effectiveness and serves as a platform to manage and grow PROGenerics, our proprietary generics formulary, and other global generic programs. Moreover, the location and timezone of ABC Switzerland facilitates coordination and activity with our partners at WBAD. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we have expanded our international presence  while improving the services we offer our partners. 
In the U.S., we continue to ramp activity at our  National Distribution Center in Columbus. We have more than doubled the volume going through the facility during the March quarter, and we will continue to add additional manufacturers to its programs over the remainder of the fiscal year. All of these activities are great examples of new efficiencies and innovations that wholesalers bring to the supply chain and of the specific value AmerisourceBergen brings to the table. 
ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing process changes on certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 16%. Our physician distribution business performed very well, and ASP was again particularly strong in the March quarter. Our community oncology business performed well in the March quarter due to a mix of new business, some brand oncology product price increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persist, we are very pleased that the community oncology market stabilized, which we believe is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology care will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well positioned to ensure that our customers remain at the forefront of cancer care. 
I have also noted that our individual business units increasingly become less distinct from one another while focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our leadership team is focused on achieving enterprise-wide solutions that will impact our customers and enhance our competitive position. Nowhere is this more evident than in the specialty area where the unique combination of services and expertise we offer helps manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunity and challenges of this dynamic segment of the market. We have spent virtually decades carefully developing our portfolio of specialty offerings and building up the capabilities necessary to handle complex products with special needs. We extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products. We definitely meet the needs of physicians, clinics and health systems, and we have pioneered the development of commercialization and reimbursement consulting services and patient access and adherence programs. 
One of the work we have done and investments we have made in our facilities, our people and our technology has been done in an effort to collaboratively meet the needs of biotech innovators, established pharmaceutical companies and of physician and other providers who administer these life-changing therapies, which positively impacts the lives of the patients we all ultimately serve. 
Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biological product, a generic version of a mature therapy or a promising growth area such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the unique expertise and the right portfolio required to help ensure the widest market for a product, the greatest patient access and the most varied support services, all conducted in an extremely efficient manner that generates tremendous value for all stakeholders. 
As consolidation and the economic realities of health reform drive even more focus on the specialty product segment, I've never felt more confident that AmerisourceBergen is the best positioned partner for our various stakeholders to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. 
Now let me say a few words about biosimilars specifically, which are understandably generating a great deal of attention. We believe that the introduction of biosimilars to U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further demonstrate our strengths in these areas. While we cannot be certain of the timing of biosimilar introductions and many other questions still remain regarding the pricing of products, the degree of substitutability and the specific mechanisms of reimbursement, we are looking forward to working with our partners to ensure that patients will be the ultimate beneficiary of the introduction of biosimilars. We have the widest access possible to these products. The majority of the benefits from biosimilars are still [indiscernible] away, so -- but we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new category of products. 
As we look ahead, we are thrilled to extend the distribution and specialty expertise we have accumulated into the animal health space. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the MWI transaction in late February, and we are pleased officially welcome Jim Cleary, Mary Pat Thompson and the rest of the MWI team to AmerisourceBergen. Jim is now a member of my executive lead team, and the integration is off to a terrific start. Our results in this quarter include about 1 month of MWI's results, which were ahead of our expectations. We remain quite confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and that we will meet our targets for synergy capture as planned. MWI's results are now reported under our Other segment, along with our Consulting business and World Courier. 
Coincidentally, today marks the third year anniversary since we closed our World Courier transaction. World Courier has helped us think globally, and we have together exceeded so many of the integration and strategic goals we laid out in our business case. Congratulations to all the associates at World Courier on their third anniversary of joining AmerisourceBergen. 
All the manufacturer services businesses together had a solid March quarter. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas, our increasingly global reach and our experience in developing patient access and adherence program is a differentiator for AmerisourceBergen today and an opportunity for growth in the future, particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market. 
It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. The combination of a pipeline full of innovative products and expanding access to health care drives meaningful improvement in patients' lives and growth opportunities across the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we have previously discussed, many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. As Americans [ph] age, pet ownership is increasing and pets themselves are living longer, thanks to improvements in pharmaceutical care and advanced procedures that enhance the lives of pets. In addition, the increasing global demand for food drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has garnered in the U.S. into developing global markets. 
Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Our year-over-year comparisons are much more difficult in the next 2 quarters, while our underlying business trends remain strong. For example, as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will gradually begin to fully anniversary the benefits from the Walgreens generic business and the contributions from the sourcing joint venture. In addition, we need a substantial amount of generic inflation in the next 2 quarters just to match what we experienced in the prior year. Brand inflation has been quite strong in the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2015, and we are seeing some brand price increases on specialty products that likely won't recur in the second half of the year. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium launch in the March quarter, there remains only one generic supplier. So the economic value of the product for ABC is not optimal. 
Given these trends, our performance in the March quarter and the addition of MWI, we have raised our guidance for the remainder of the year. Tim will provide greater detail. But in summary, and on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 12% to 13%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 22% to 25% and free cash flow generation in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
As we reported in our press release this morning, our board has authorized a new $1 billion special share repurchase program designed to further offset the potential dilution from the future exercise of the warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance. As we approach the exercise dates on these warrants, we will continue to evaluate our efforts to offset the dilutive impact of exercise and explore a variety of approaches to offset the dilutive impact of exercises -- I beg your pardon, and explore a variety of approaches to achieve our desired outcome, including through possible M&A. In addition to activity under the special program, we continue to expect to repurchase $200 million under our normal repurchase program. 
I'm very pleased with the outstanding financial and operating performance we achieved across our entire business in the first half of fiscal 2015. While there are many moving parts in the remainder of the year, I'm confident that we will meet our financial and operational objectives for the year. As I said last quarter, generating strong business results requires more than meeting financial and operating goals. True value creation results from stellar execution, innovative thinking and the bold implementation of new ideas. I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations by partnering with them to find creative new ways to meet current and future challenges. The tremendous strength of our now expanded core business is such a powerful platform upon which to build and to make vital contributions to the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of human and animal customers and, by so doing, continue to provide excellent returns to our stakeholders. 
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our second fiscal quarter ended March 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. 
I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I will also cover our consolidated cash flow highlights. As Steve mentioned, this is our first period that our results include MWI, which essentially means one month of their activity. The second topic, I will spend a few minutes covering our warrant hedging progress to date. And the last topic, I will cover our revised fiscal '15 expectations. 
So with that, we can begin our Q2 review. Revenues were $32.7 billion, up nearly 15%. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for just under half of that revenue growth. This is our second quarter of having all of this business, meaning their brand and generic volumes, for the entire quarter. So a majority of this customer growth is due to the year-over-year ramping of the business. I should highlight that the addition of MWI contributed about 1% to our overall growth rate. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 25% to just over $1 billion. The strong growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth, especially generics. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased about 18% to approximately $490 million. Excluding MWI, our operating expense growth would have been 11%, and roughly 2% of this growth was related to compensation accruals needed due to our year-to-date performance versus our internal plan. Consistent with past quarters, the remaining expense growth relates to higher overall business volumes and IT expenses. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $553 million, up about $136 million or a very strong 33% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.69%, up 23 basis points. 
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense, net, was about $21 million and included $5.5 million of interest and fee associated with the MWI financing for roughly 5 weeks in the quarter. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 35.7% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. Growth in World Courier, BluePoint private label and now our Switzerland manufacturer services business is causing a change in our U.S.-to-international income mix and is consequently lowering our consolidated tax rate. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 37%. 
For the quarter, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 37% to $1.45, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230.4 million shares, down just under 2%. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $31.8 billion, up 14%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Company's led the way with a 13% revenue increase. 
Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 3 items: market growth -- one, market growth continues to be good, driven by volume, strong pricing and the new hepatitis C drugs; two, our sales to our largest customer exceeded our expectations; and three, as mentioned before, we haven't anniversary-ed the full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize this revenue benefit. 
In terms of mix, Drug Company's total generic revenues increased nearly 50% year-over-year in dollars. Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 25%. And similar to last quarter, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues on a comparable basis, our specialty business grew an impressive 16% with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We continue to see solid growth in our community oncology business with the percentage growth rate in the high single digits. And, finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth, contributing about 1/3 of the 16% comparable growth rate due to new business wins and increased volumes. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before intrasegment eliminations, consistent with how we've reported these growth rates in past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $849 million, up about 22%. Drug Company was the driver of a majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth, and, as I've called out, especially due to higher generic revenues. 
In terms of total segment price appreciation, we ended the quarter higher than we expected in terms of dollar contribution. We were better than expected in the contribution for brand inflation, and this more than offset being slightly lower on the benefit from generic inflation. 
Operating expenses were $361 million and were up about 12%. As I mentioned previously, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting this segment's significant volume growth. OpEx also includes the additional incentive compensation accruals primarily related to strong performance of the 2 businesses in this segment. 
Segment operating income was $489 million and up about 31%, driven by the outstanding performance of the Drug Company. As Steve highlighted, we're also extremely pleased with our specialty business with an operating income growth rate in the high teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and, beginning in this quarter, MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $986 million, up 72%. Excluding the impact of MWI, the revenue growth would have been slightly less than 20% with most of this coming from our Consulting business and specifically the TheraCom distribution business. MWI had a very good revenue month primarily as a result of its companion animal business. Positive trends in the industry, including new innovative drugs and increased visits to vet practices, are driving high companion animal revenue growth. During this period, production animal revenues were up modestly, impacted primarily by cattle feedlot placements being down year-over-year. 
From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $64 million, reflecting growth of 47%. The segment's growth benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. 
Let me highlight from a margin standpoint. MWI's margin was better this period versus what they've had historically due to having a better mix of companion animal revenue. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. 
Warrants. The fair value of the warrants increased significantly to $2.7 billion as of March 31. This increase in value was correlated to the 26% increase in the ABC share price during the March quarter. Our GAAP warrant expense was $753 million for the quarter, and roughly 75% of this expense represented a cumulative adjustment as the accounting rules require ABC to record expense as if the $2.7 billion fair value was the fair value back on day 1 of warrant issuance. 
LIFO this quarter, we recorded an expense of $151 million. This means on a year-to-date basis, we have recorded about half of our full year estimates of $586 million, which is slightly greater than our estimates for the first fiscal quarter. 
This wraps up our P&L review, and let me switch and cover cash. 
This quarter, we again had very good free cash flow, $690 million. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues, about 50% year-over-year, continue to drive improved working capital metrics. Specifically, our DPO or days payable to suppliers, improved about 6 days from last year. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.3 billion, which was very good considering we partially funded the MWI acquisition and also continued with our warrant hedging activities. 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our second topic, warrant hedging. As we talk to investors, we are receiving a number of warrant questions, especially now that the first opportunity for Walgreens Boots Alliance to exercise is less than a year away, March 2016. As a reminder, the 2016 and 2017 warrants each represent an option to buy approximately 23 million shares. ABC will receive roughly $1.2 billion in proceeds at the time of each exercise. 
To date, we have used 3 strategies to offset the expected warrant dilution. The first strategy: we entered into the original capped call that can be exercised by ABC. In 2016 and 2017, we plan to use 60% of the warrant proceeds to fund the exercise of these capped calls. The second strategy: we have repurchased 5.1 million shares to date under our special share repurchase program. The third strategy: in the March 2015 quarter, we purchased call options for 6 million shares for $80 million. We have the right to exercise the option during designated time periods between April 2015 and the end of October 2015. Funding these exercises will require the use of capital of approximately $570 million. The average strike price of the call options is $95. 
Let me switch gears and address warrant coverage. First, the 2016 warrants. At March 31 and based on our closing share price on that date, which was $113.67, the capped calls covered 46% of the expected dilution. Adding the 1.51 million shares already repurchased, we come about 70% hedged on the 2016 warrants. Now looking forward and assuming we successfully exercise the call options representing 6 million shares, we move to 95% hedged. 
For the 2017 warrants, again at March 31 and based on our closing share price on that date, the capped calls covered 42% of the expected dilution. We have not completed any other share repurchases or hedging activities related to the 2017 warrants yet. 
To enable our investors to better track our coverage as our share price changes, I'd like to highlight that for every $5 increase from our March 31 closing share price, our total hedging coverage on each warrant will decrease by about 2%. Likewise, if our share price decreases by $5, our total coverage will increase by about 2% on each warrant. 
As a reminder, premiums paid for call options are not expensed in our P&L. They directly impact our equity account. And shares specifically earmarked for hedging are not included in our adjusted share count for EPS purposes. We will net these shares into the adjusted share count when the new shares are issued at the time of warrant exercise. 
So to summarize this section, ABC remains committed to offsetting expected dilution in our adjusted EPS from the warrant exercises. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital deployment, including repurchasing shares and other hedging activity, as well as looking for other means to fill the EPS gap from the warrant dilution, including strategic M&A. 
Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My guidance comments will now include MWI. 
Revenues. Based on positive trends in our business and also the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 12% to 13% range. MWI is expected to account for about 2% for this growth. 
Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be in the range of 19% to 21%, driven by our first half performance, stronger full year revenues, especially generics, and adding MWI. 
Operating margin. We now expect that our operating margin will be up 8 to 10 basis points due to the performance of our business and mix with MWI having a higher margin in our drug and specialty businesses. 
Our adjusted dilution share count for the full year  is expected to be down just under 1% due to exercises under employee stock compensation plan and reduced share buybacks. In fact, we expect our Q3 and Q4 adjusted share count to be higher on a year-over-year basis. 
Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which reflects growth of 22% to 25% from last year's adjusted EPS. As we have said on prior investor calls, even though the second half of the year will include the contribution from MWI, we have a very tough EPS comparable due to strong generic price appreciation last year, we also begin to anniversary the Walgreens contribution and our renewed contract with the Department of Defense starts with revised market pricing. 
Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases remains at $200 million for the full year. 
Switching to our free cash flow guidance. Due to the combination of strong generic revenue growth and generics having positive working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
I would like to make one final comment about share repurchases and our share count. Historically, we've committed to deploying $400 million to $500 million for share repurchases in a given year subject to market conditions and other uses of cash like M&A. When we had a much lower share price, we were able to both offset employee stock option exercises and reduce our overall share count. As a reference point, our employee stock exercises can be roughly 2% of our outstanding shares in a given year. Going forward, due to our current share price, we will be challenged to just keep our adjusted share count flat while deploying the same approximate dollars. 
As I wrap up, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. I've covered several key areas, and I hope you found this information helpful. 
At the halfway point of our fiscal year, we are executing very well. We are working to integrate our new business, MWI, and we are thrilled with progress to date. And we remain committed to making the right long-term investment to continue to grow our earnings. 
Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

So I was just in a TDS convention, met with all the global heads and U.S. heads of just about every big generic company, and I believe we're very well positioned. Certainly, generic price increases are something that has added a little bit of upside to our performance.

And we never ever had a big chain customer that was buying their store business for us. We had -- others we have, of course, within the various companies, but we've never had a big chain customer. I think that's been very, very helpful. It's helped with the capacity and scale issues that we have in our distribution centers. And we certainly are having to make more investments to keep up with the pace with our largest customer. And, of course, our PBM customer is a huge driver, around -- somewhere in the high teens, as well of our revenues.

As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered outstanding financial results in our second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $32.7 billion. Our adju",2342,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered outstanding financial results in our second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $32.7 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 36% to $1.45 while we generated a very strong $700 million in operating cash flow. In addition to the excellent financial and operating performance, we also made important progress against our strategic objectives as we closed of acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and we extended our contract with our large PBM customer for an additional year. 
          
          The strength of our core business, combined with our disciplined capital management, gives us the flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings to new market segments and continue to drive innovation across the pharmaceutical supply channel. We've had an exceptional first half of fiscal 2015, and we are very well positioned to meet our increased expectations for the full year. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the March quarter. Holding on to momentum we had coming out of our first quarter, our performance in the second quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth, and continuing improvement in working capital led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. 
          
          AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter with revenues up 15% even as we continued to anniversary the Walgreens brand business and some of the generic business. Good organic growth rates overcame the roll-off of some old business, and sales of the new hepatitis C drugs also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall, drug pricing trends remain favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. 
          
          We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health system and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Our diverse customer base helps us to ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long-established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships help ensure our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. This footprint is a tremendous strategic and tactical value, both for those launching new products and for those providing daily care to patients. 
          
          To have a trusted partner who has a key role in improving patient access to pharmaceuticals is critical in a health care system that is rapidly evolving with each passing day. And having a partner who works collaboratively to maximize efficiency and reach is essential in a market with increasing demand and decreasing resources. Our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is progressing very well. Sales of brand and generic products to Walgreens stores are growing faster than expected, and we are very pleased with the economic contributions from the sourcing JV. Our relationship evolves along with the markets we both serve, and we are continuously working collaboratively to enhance the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers. 
          
          On the international front in our drug distribution business, our BluePoint private label program is performing well, and we achieved an important milestone this quarter as we launched our first generic injectable product under the BluePoint label. Activities in ABC Switzerland are well under way, and we -- and are beginning to contribute value to both ABC and to the manufacturers we serve. ABC Switzerland functions as an intermediary for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturers, managing strategic relationships and fostering specific new value-added activities. It provides enhanced data analytics and market intelligence to assist manufacturers with their supply chain effectiveness and serves as a platform to manage and grow PROGenerics, our proprietary generics formulary, and other global generic programs. Moreover, the location and timezone of ABC Switzerland facilitates coordination and activity with our partners at WBAD. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we have expanded our international presence  while improving the services we offer our partners. 
In the U.S., we continue to ramp activity at our  National Distribution Center in Columbus. We have more than doubled the volume going through the facility during the March quarter, and we will continue to add additional manufacturers to its programs over the remainder of the fiscal year. All of these activities are great examples of new efficiencies and innovations that wholesalers bring to the supply chain and of the specific value AmerisourceBergen brings to the table. 
          
          ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing process changes on certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 16%. Our physician distribution business performed very well, and ASP was again particularly strong in the March quarter. Our community oncology business performed well in the March quarter due to a mix of new business, some brand oncology product price increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persist, we are very pleased that the community oncology market stabilized, which we believe is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology care will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well positioned to ensure that our customers remain at the forefront of cancer care. 
          
          I have also noted that our individual business units increasingly become less distinct from one another while focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our leadership team is focused on achieving enterprise-wide solutions that will impact our customers and enhance our competitive position. Nowhere is this more evident than in the specialty area where the unique combination of services and expertise we offer helps manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunity and challenges of this dynamic segment of the market. We have spent virtually decades carefully developing our portfolio of specialty offerings and building up the capabilities necessary to handle complex products with special needs. We extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products. We definitely meet the needs of physicians, clinics and health systems, and we have pioneered the development of commercialization and reimbursement consulting services and patient access and adherence programs. 
          
          All of the work we have done and investments we have made in our facilities, our people and our technology has been done in an effort to collaboratively meet the needs of biotech innovators, established pharmaceutical companies and of physician and other providers who administer these life-changing therapies, which positively impacts the lives of the patients we all ultimately serve. 
Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biological product, a generic version of a mature therapy or a promising growth area such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the unique expertise and the right portfolio required to help ensure the widest market for a product, the greatest patient access and the most varied support services, all conducted in an extremely efficient manner that generates tremendous value for all stakeholders. 
          
          As consolidation and the economic realities of health reform drive even more focus on the specialty product segment, I've never felt more confident that AmerisourceBergen is the best positioned partner for our various stakeholders to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. 
Now let me say a few words about biosimilars specifically, which are understandably generating a great deal of attention. We believe that the introduction of biosimilars to U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further demonstrate our strengths in these areas. While we cannot be certain of the timing of biosimilar introductions and many other questions still remain regarding the pricing of products, the degree of substitutability and the specific mechanisms of reimbursement, we are looking forward to working with our partners to ensure that patients will be the ultimate beneficiary of the introduction of biosimilars. We have the widest access possible to these products. The majority of the benefits from biosimilars are still largely a ways off, but we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new category of products. 
As we look ahead, we are thrilled to extend the distribution and specialty expertise we have accumulated into the animal health space. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the MWI transaction in late February, and we are pleased officially welcome Jim Cleary, Mary Pat Thompson and the rest of the MWI team to AmerisourceBergen. Jim is now a member of my executive lead team, and the integration is off to a terrific start. Our results in this quarter include about 1 month of MWI's results, which were ahead of our expectations. We remain quite confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and that we will meet our targets for synergy capture as planned. MWI's results are now reported under our Other segment, along with our Consulting business and World Courier. 
Coincidentally, today marks the third year anniversary since we closed our World Courier transaction. World Courier has helped us think globally, and we have together exceeded so many of the integration and strategic goals we laid out in our business case. Congratulations to all the associates at World Courier on their third anniversary of joining AmerisourceBergen. 
All the manufacturer services businesses together had a solid March quarter. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas, our increasingly global reach and our experience in developing patient access and adherence program is a differentiator for AmerisourceBergen today and an opportunity for growth in the future, particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market. 
It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. The combination of a pipeline full of innovative products and expanding access to health care drives meaningful improvement in patients' lives and growth opportunities across the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we have previously discussed, many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. As Americans age, pet ownership is increasing and pets themselves are living longer, thanks to improvements in pharmaceutical care and advanced procedures that enhance the lives of pets. In addition, the increasing global demand for food drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has garnered in the U.S. into developing global markets. 
          
          Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Our year-over-year comparisons are much more difficult in the next 2 quarters, while our underlying business trends remain strong. For example, as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will gradually begin to fully anniversary the benefits from the Walgreens generic business and the contributions from the sourcing joint venture. In addition, we need a substantial amount of generic inflation in the next 2 quarters just to match what we experienced in the prior year. Brand inflation has been quite strong in the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2015, and we are seeing some brand price increases on specialty products that likely won't recur in the second half of the year. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium launch in the March quarter, there remains only one generic supplier. So the economic value of the product for ABC is not optimal. 
          
          Given these trends, our performance in the March quarter and the addition of MWI, we have raised our guidance for the remainder of the year. Tim will provide greater detail. But in summary, and on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 12% to 13%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 22% to 25% and free cash flow generation in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
As we reported in our press release this morning, our board has authorized a new $1 billion special share repurchase program designed to further offset the potential dilution from the future exercise of the warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance. As we approach the exercise dates on these warrants, we will continue to evaluate our efforts to offset the dilutive impact of exercise and explore a variety of approaches to offset the dilutive impact of exercises -- I beg your pardon, and explore a variety of approaches to achieve our desired outcome, including through possible M&A. In addition to activity under the special program, we continue to expect to repurchase $200 million under our normal repurchase program. 
I'm very pleased with the outstanding financial and operating performance we achieved across our entire business in the first half of fiscal 2015. While there are many moving parts in the remainder of the year, I'm confident that we will meet our financial and operational objectives for the year. As I said last quarter, generating strong business results requires more than meeting financial and operating goals. True value creation results from stellar execution, innovative thinking and the bold implementation of new ideas. I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations by partnering with them to find creative new ways to meet current and future challenges. The tremendous strength of our now expanded core business gives us a powerful platform upon which to build and to make vital contributions to the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of human and animal customers and, by so doing, continue to provide excellent returns to our stakeholders. 
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our second fiscal quarter ended March 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. 
          
          I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I will also cover our consolidated cash flow highlights. As Steve mentioned, this is our first period that our results include MWI, which essentially means one month of their activity. The second topic, I will spend a few minutes covering our warrant hedging progress to date. And the last topic, I will cover our revised fiscal '15 expectations. 
So with that, we can begin our Q2 review. Revenues were $32.7 billion, up nearly 15%. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for just under half of that revenue growth. This is our second quarter of having all of this business, meaning their brand and generic volumes, for the entire quarter. So a majority of this customer growth is due to the year-over-year ramping of the business. I should highlight that the addition of MWI contributed about 1% to our overall growth rate. 
          
          The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 25% to just over $1 billion. The strong growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth, especially generics. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased about 18% to approximately $490 million. Excluding MWI, our operating expense growth would have been 11%, and roughly 2% of this growth was related to compensation accruals needed due to our year-to-date performance versus our internal plan. Consistent with past quarters, the remaining expense growth relates to higher overall business volumes and IT expenses. 
          
          Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $553 million, up about $136 million or a very strong 33% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.69%, up 23 basis points. 
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense, net, was about $21 million and included $5.5 million of interest and fee associated with the MWI financing for roughly 5 weeks in the quarter. 
          
          Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 35.7% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. Growth in World Courier, BluePoint private label and now our Switzerland manufacturer services business is causing a change in our U.S.-to-international income mix and is consequently lowering our consolidated tax rate. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 37%. 
          
          For the quarter, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 37% to $1.45, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230.4 million shares, down just under 2%. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $31.8 billion, up 14%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Companies led the way with a 13% revenue increase. 
          
          Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 3 items: market growth -- one, market growth continues to be good, driven by volume, strong pricing and the new hepatitis C drugs; two, our sales to our largest customer exceeded our expectations; and three, as mentioned before, we haven't anniversary-ed the full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize this revenue benefit. 
          
          In terms of mix, Drug Company's total generic revenues increased nearly 50% year-over-year in dollars. Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 25%. And similar to last quarter, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues on a comparable basis, our specialty business grew an impressive 16% with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We continue to see solid growth in our community oncology business with a percentage growth rate in the high single digits. And, finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth, contributing about 1/3 of the 16% comparable growth rate due to new business wins and increased volumes. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before intrasegment eliminations, consistent with how we've reported these growth rates in past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $849 million, up about 22%. Drug Company was the driver of a majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth, and, as I've called out, especially due to higher generic revenues. 
          
          In terms of total segment price appreciation, we ended the quarter higher than we expected in terms of dollar contribution. We were better than expected in the contribution for brand inflation, and this more than offset being slightly lower on the benefit from generic inflation. 
          
          Operating expenses were $361 million and were up about 12%. As I mentioned previously, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting this segment's significant volume growth. OpEx also includes the additional incentive compensation accruals primarily related to strong performance of the 2 businesses in this segment. 
          
          Segment operating income was $489 million and up about 31%, driven by the outstanding performance of the Drug Company. As Steve highlighted, we're also extremely pleased with our specialty business with an operating income growth rate in the high teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and, beginning in this quarter, MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $986 million, up 72%. Excluding the impact of MWI, the revenue growth would have been slightly less than 20% with most of this coming from our Consulting business and specifically the TheraCom distribution business. MWI had a very good revenue month primarily as a result of its companion animal business. Positive trends in the industry, including new innovative drugs and increased visits to vet practices, are driving high companion animal revenue growth. During this period, production animal revenues were up modestly, impacted primarily by cattle feedlot placements being down year-over-year. 
          
          From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $64 million, reflecting growth of 47%. The segment's growth benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. 
Let me highlight from a margin standpoint. MWI's margin was better this period versus what they've had historically due to having a better mix of companion animal revenue. 
          
          This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. 
          
          Warrants. The fair value of the warrants increased significantly to $2.7 billion as of March 31. This increase in value was correlated to the 26% increase in the ABC share price during the March quarter. Our GAAP warrant expense was $753 million for the quarter, and roughly 75% of this expense represented a cumulative adjustment as the accounting rules require ABC to record expense as if the $2.7 billion fair value was the fair value back on day 1 of warrant issuance. 
          
          LIFO this quarter, we recorded an expense of $151 million. This means on a year-to-date basis, we have recorded about half of our full year estimates of $586 million, which is slightly greater than our estimates for the first fiscal quarter. 
          
          This wraps up our P&L review, and let me switch and cover cash. 
          
          This quarter, we again had very good free cash flow, $690 million. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues, about 50% year-over-year, continue to drive improved working capital metrics. Specifically, our DPO or days payable to suppliers, improved about 6 days from last year. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.3 billion, which was very good considering we partially funded the MWI acquisition and also continued with our warrant hedging activities. 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our second topic, warrant hedging. As we talk to investors, we are receiving a number of warrant questions, especially now that the first opportunity for Walgreens Boots Alliance to exercise is less than a year away, March 2016. As a reminder, the 2016 and 2017 warrants each represent an option to buy approximately 23 million shares. ABC will receive roughly $1.2 billion in proceeds at the time of each exercise. 
          
          To date, we have used 3 strategies to offset the expected warrant dilution. The first strategy: we entered into the original capped call that can be exercised by ABC. In 2016 and 2017, we plan to use 60% of the warrant proceeds to fund the exercise of these capped calls. The second strategy: we have repurchased 5.1 million shares to date under our special share repurchase program. The third strategy: in the March 2015 quarter, we purchased call options for 6 million shares for $80 million. We have the right to exercise the option during designated time periods between April 2015 and the end of October 2015. Funding these exercises will require the use of capital of approximately $570 million. The average strike price of the call options is $95. 
Let me switch gears and address warrant coverage. First, the 2016 warrants. At March 31 and based on our closing share price on that date, which was $113.67, the capped calls covered 46% of the expected dilution. Adding the 1.51 million shares already repurchased, we come about 70% hedged on the 2016 warrants. Now looking forward and assuming we successfully exercise the call options representing 6 million shares, we move to 95% hedged. 
          
          For the 2017 warrants, again at March 31 and based on our closing share price on that date, the capped calls covered 42% of the expected dilution. We have not completed any other share repurchases or hedging activities related to the 2017 warrants yet. 
          
          To enable our investors to better track our coverage as our share price changes, I'd like to highlight that for every $5 increase from our March 31 closing share price, our total hedging coverage on each warrant will decrease by about 2%. Likewise, if our share price decreases by $5, our total coverage will increase by about 2% on each warrant. 
          
          As a reminder, premiums paid for call options are not expensed in our P&L. They directly impact our equity account. And shares specifically earmarked for hedging are not included in our adjusted share count for EPS purposes. We will net these shares into the adjusted share count when the new shares are issued at the time of warrant exercise. 
So to summarize this section, ABC remains committed to offsetting expected dilution in our adjusted EPS from the warrant exercises. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital deployment, including repurchasing shares and other hedging activity, as well as looking for other means to fill the EPS gap from the warrant dilution, including strategic M&A. 
          
          Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My guidance comments will now include MWI. 
          
          Revenues. Based on positive trends in our business and also the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 12% to 13% range. MWI is expected to account for about 2% for this growth. 
          
          Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be in the range of 19% to 21%, driven by our first half performance, stronger full year revenues, especially generics, and adding MWI. 
          
          Operating margin. We now expect that our operating margin will be up 8 to 10 basis points due to the performance of our business and mix with MWI having a higher margin in our drug and specialty businesses. 
          
          Our adjusted dilution share count for the full year  is expected to be down just under 1% due to exercises under employee stock compensation plan and reduced share buybacks. In fact, we expect our Q3 and Q4 adjusted share count to be higher on a year-over-year basis. 
          
          Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which reflects growth of 22% to 25% from last year's adjusted EPS. As we have said on prior investor calls, even though the second half of the year will include the contribution from MWI, we have a very tough EPS comparable due to strong generic price appreciation last year, we also begin to anniversary the Walgreens contribution and our renewed contract with the Department of Defense starts with revised market pricing. 
Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases remains at $200 million for the full year. 
          
          Switching to our free cash flow guidance. Due to the combination of strong generic revenue growth and generics having positive working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
I would like to make one final comment about share repurchases and our share count. Historically, we've committed to deploying $400 million to $500 million for share repurchases in a given year subject to market conditions and other uses of cash like M&A. When we had a much lower share price, we were able to both offset employee stock option exercises and reduce our overall share count. As a reference point, our employee stock exercises can be roughly 2% of our outstanding shares in a given year. Going forward, due to our current share price, we will be challenged to just keep our adjusted share count flat while deploying the same approximate dollars. 
As I wrap up, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. I've covered several key areas, and I hope you found this information helpful. 
          
          At the halfway point of our fiscal year, we are executing very well. We are working to integrate our new business, MWI, and we are thrilled with progress to date. And we remain committed to making the right long-term investment to continue to grow our earnings. 
Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

And at the time, I think we maintained very strongly that it was very hard for others to match this portfolio of assets. And I think that has become even more so since -- as time has evolved. So I was just in a TDS convention, met with all the global heads and U.S. heads of just about every big generic company, and I believe we're very well positioned. Certainly, generic price increases are something that has added a little bit of upside to our performance, as there's variability from quarter to quarter, which we try to point out to the best of our ability as --  given that we want you to have full understanding of our financials. We've got a good headwind in the next 2 quarters. But we -- the challenge with our customers, all of them and particularly I've been talking here about the ProGen customers, is to get those reimbursement tables changed quicker. And that's what we really are focused on through Good Neighbor Pharmacy Provider Network and other resources that AmerisourceBergen has.

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release, our revenues increased 13%",2149,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release, our revenues increased 13% to $34.2 billion. Now adjusted earnings per share were up 19% to $1.2 billion, [indiscernible] $1.26, and we generated exceptional $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our results were driven by solid performance across all of our core businesses and include a full quarter impact from MWI Veterinary Supply, which is performing better-than-expected. The progress we have made in strengthening our existing platforms and investing in new ones demonstrates our commitment to providing our customers and suppliers with [indiscernible] solutions that enable us to collaboratively address the challenges of a cost-changing landscape. We constantly seek to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership, in an effort to drive innovation in both human and animal Healthcare Services. The quality of our offerings, a seamless execution and our disciplined capital management gives us the flexibility to grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for manufacturers and health care provider customers, our stakeholders, and our other stakeholders for many years to come. 
Our excellent performance through the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 sets us up very well to meet our objectives for the full year. As expected, we have begun to face some headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2015 and we are beginning to anniversary many of the significant benefits of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots alliance. However, organic growth rate remained strong, [indiscernible] growing faster than our overall market and I feel our excellent portfolio of leading pharmaceutical services companies positions us extremely well to continue to take advantage of the opportunities across the entire pharmaceutical supply channel. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the June quarter. Holding on the exceptional momentum we had in the first half of our year, our performance in the third quarter was very solid. Strong revenue and gross profit growth, both excellent adjusted earnings per share growth and continuing improvement in working capital terms led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter, with revenues up 9%, even as we continue to anniversary the on-boarding of the Walgreens business. [indiscernible] organic growth and strong brand drug pricing contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. While generic drug inflation is slowly increasing [ph] generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased that our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Next week, we will be hosting our annual trade show for our independent pharmacy customers in Las Vegas, and we are looking forward to presenting our enhanced offerings and new programs in this important customer segment. I've never been more excited about the opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists to impact the delivery of health care in the U.S. We have invested in several new initiatives that will enable us to offer independent pharmacies a set of enhanced capabilities that will support their efforts to improve patient care and to receive fair and accurate payments from payers with a new level of transparency. We are proud to be the advocate for community pharmacies by increasingly provide some of the most important touch points, ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care. You'll be hearing more about how we further empower the efforts and evolve our GNP network over the next few weeks. We're also very active with regulators and legislators both independently and through our trade associations, who expertly advise and inform those important constituents on personnel issues for our industry and our customers. 
We continue to be very pleased with the progress we have made in our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. As unique industry changing relationship is being both strategically and operationally important to ABC. Significantly as a customers, we continue to enjoy above-market growth from WBA this quarter. While we have almost fully anniversary-ed the on-boarding of the distribution business, we're not finished with the relationship and we are both focused on exploring additional ways in creating new value it points through WBAD and other share opportunities. 
As our retail business is growing substantially over the last 2 years, we would have strong performance in our health systems segments. During the quarter, we were very pleased to receive the Key Distributer of the Year and Mark McKenna Supplier of the Year Award for Innovation which is being a valued partner for many years. I believe this recognition from innovation [indiscernible] tremendous change for AmerisourceBergen highlights the tireless efforts our associates make everyday to ensure that all of our customers are well served. AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had impressive results in the quarter. There are number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of previously reported manufacturing post changes on certain oncology products which moved some revenues from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 13%. Opposition distribution business, ASD and our Community Oncology businesses all performed very well in the quarter. While reimbursement issues with ASP drive [indiscernible], market leadership and credibility in the specialty company and [indiscernible] the continued source of pride and differentiation for AmerisourceBergen. Our work with many of these leaders and associates in some cases [indiscernible] and are always passionate, constantly innovative and importantly, remain very customer-centric. Their performance this year has been especially strong and positions us well to continue to drive and be the leader in the specialty arena. The decades we have spent for developing our portfolio of specialty offerings, involving us of the expertise in the industry to handle complex products and services enabled us to play a leading role in dealing with products with special needs. Our capabilities extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and entered a distinct requirements of specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biological, the generic version of a mature therapy or a promising growth area such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the expertise required to help ensure product success across the entire life cycle of the drug. It helps reform other economic realities to even more focus on the specialty product safety. 
AmerisourceBergen is best-positioned to help our partners maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. Regarding biosimilars specifically, we continue to believe that their introduction to U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further develop and demonstrate our strength in these areas. We are not certain on the timing of specific product launches, while we remain excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new type of product, majority of the assets from biosimilars are still likely a ways for us. Of course, our collaborative afterwards are no longer confined to the U.S. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we've expanded our international presence by improving the services we offer our manufacturer and provider customers. Our Blue Point label program and ABC Switzerland are progressing well, now demonstrated of innovative services and solutions through develop in the years ahead. In addition, we are pleased with the progress we have made with our specialty joint venture in Brazil.  [indiscernible] U.S., we continue to add the measure in our programs, thanks to our national distribution center in Columbus. Wholesalers have never been more important to the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we move through a wave of customer and supplier consolidations, and the health care landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace, there is great opportunity for our industry and for AmerisourceBergen in particular to demonstrate the full value we can provide. 
Let's turn now to the other segments. As I mentioned earlier, this was the first time we had a full quarter of MWI in our results and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and on identification of synergies. I'm very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and will make important contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we expand our efforts into animal health. We continue to believe we acquired a first class company, an organization of MWI. [indiscernible] and his team are the acknowledged leaders in this field and enthusiastic about the way they can further enhance the offering with expanded opportunity under the ABC umbrella. Their willingness to embrace and innovative ideas and their commitment to both outstanding execution and customer service bodes well to the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. Our manufacture services business also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access in [indiscernible] program and experience would bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas is differentiated today. The increasingly global reach and our manufacturer services businesses further expect our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offset [indiscernible] global clinical and consulting solutions for virtually any specialty product launch in the developed world. It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, albeit driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, exceptional launches of new brand products and population demographics. 
Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality life of companion animals, and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining good health. In addition, the increasing global demand for protein drive the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has gone in the U.S. into developing global markets. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2015, we can expect the strong trend in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Tim will provide more detail, but given the strength in our performance in the June quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year to 4 92 to 4 97, which represent outstanding growth of 24% to 25% over last year. As we look further ahead to fiscal 2016, it is too early to give detailed guidance, but we can see a path to earnings per share growth in the low teens. 
We are still working through our in depth process, but there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we think you should bear in mind as you think about our growth rates for fiscal 2016. First, the tailwinds, continued solid organic revenue growth and brand drug inflation; secondly, better generic launches and 5 incremental [indiscernible] benefits from MWI acquisition. The headwinds are significant impact from [indiscernible] contract repricing in the first half of the year; other customer renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016 include Kaiser late in the fiscal year and declining contribution from generic inflation. There are a few additional assumptions to concentrate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution for [indiscernible] because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. We expect to repurchased $300 million in shares under our normal program. No contribution from M&A is planned in 2016 and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain hopeful that biosimilars are a great opportunity for ABC, particularly for the physician administered products, but it is too difficult to predict the timing of any launches at this time. However, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong. I want to reiterate that these are preliminary results and that we will give our detailed guidance when we report our fourth quarter in the full. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to commend our ABC associates for delivering stellar performance through 9 months of fiscal 2015. Over the last few years, we have challenged our people to develop our talent in new leadership areas, both with our existing associates and by recruiting high-quality individuals externally in order to ensure that we can grow our business while remaining the partner of choice in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The value creation we generate is the result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas. Our associates share my conviction that we make vital contributions to the health and well-being of humans and animals, and by setting in that role, we can continue to provide excellent returns through our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now, here is Tim."

As said in the past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same per",1993,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As said in the past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I will also cover a few consolidated cash flow highlights. The second topic I will briefly recap our warrant hedging progress to date, and the third topic, I will wrap up with comments about guidance for fiscal year '15 and also provide some preliminary thoughts on fiscal '16. 
So with that, we can begin our Q3 review. Revenues increased $3.9 billion to $34.2 billion or 13%. On an overall basis, sales to Walgreens stores accounted for roughly 50% of our revenue dollar increase. As a reminder, this is now our third quarter of having this key customers business hitting all their brands and generic volumes for the entire quarter. Consequently, majority of their growth continues to be related to year-over-year business ramping. Additionally, MWI contributed roughly 20% of our overall revenue down [indiscernible]. The quarter's adjusted gross margin increased $184 million or 22% to just over $1 billion. About 70% of the dollar growth came from our other segment, primarily as a result of adding a full quarter of MWI's result. The remaining dollar growth was from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment driven primarily by revenue growth. 
Operating expenses, our total adjusted operating expenses increased about $122 million or 28% to approximately $551 million. Consistent with the change in gross profit dollars that I just covered, the Other segment drove about 70% of the dollar growth, again primarily due to MWI. 
Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $455 million, up about $52 million for a very strong 15% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.33%, up 3 basis points, due to adding MWI as they have a higher margin profile than our core drug businesses. Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $28 million and roughly half of the quarterly expense was related to the MWI acquisition financing. Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 35.3% for the current quarter down from the prior year. We continue to realize the decrease in our tax rate due to income growth in our International businesses. Additionally, this quarter, we realized about a 40 basis point improvement in our tax rate related to the filing of our 2014 tax return and recognizing a favorable tax provision to return adjustment. So for the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 36.5%.  For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 19% to $1.20, driven by organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefit of a lower consolidated cash rate. Our adjusted diluted share count at 231.3 million shares was essentially flat to last year's quarter. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $32.8 billion, up 10%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Company had growth and revenues up 9% driven by 2 items. The first item, market growth continues to be good driven by volume and strong pricing, especially in the branded drug side. I should note that sales of hepatitis C drugs did not contribute meaningfully to the overall revenue growth in our Drug Company and the second item, we haven't anniversary-ed full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize a revenue benefit here also. 
In terms of mix, Drug Company's total generic revenues increased year-over-year just over 20% in dollars. Most of its increase is the result of servicing Walgreens fully this quarter while last year, in the June 14 quarter, we were servicing about 70% of their location for brands and generics. Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of 22%. Similar to the past 2 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues through our Drug Company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 13% from higher volumes. A good pricing environment and new brand drug introduction. Specialties growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs from our large businesses, ASD, Oncology Supply and [indiscernible] Medical. This is the fourth quarter in a row with dollar revenue growth in oncology supply, a business that focuses on service community oncologists. These sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we have reported each growth rates in the past quarter. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit $746 million, up about 8%. We saw a very big gross profit growth in our specialty business due to higher revenue growth. Our Drug Company had solid gross profit growth from higher revenues but as discussed in the past, these contributions were negatively impacted by 2 items. One, the start of the Department of Defense contract and we renewed at a margin in line with market. And 2, we had fewer generic drug price increases in the quarter and our total dollar contribution from generic inflation was down somewhat sequentially through the March quarter and meaningfully compared to last year's quarter. 
Segment operating expenses were $368 million and were up about 11%. This increase is primarily related to payroll, delivery costs, depreciation and IT costs to support the segment's large volume growth and operational complexity. Additionally, we continue to ramp our national distribution center in Ohio and our Switzerland business. Both are performing well, but are not yet fully optimized. 
Finally, operating expense also includes the additional incentive compensation accruals related to the strong year-to-date performance of the 2 business groups in the segment. Segment operating income was $378 million and up about 5%. Our specialty business group had good growth this quarter, offset by lower growth in our core drug business due to the items I just highlighted. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.5 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, though excluding MWI, the revenue growth would have been, as a percentage in the mid-teens, with a majority of the revenue growth coming from our TheraCom distribution business and the remainder from our core consulting business including Canada. MWI had a very good revenue quarter as a result of strong companion animal revenues. On a comparable basis to last year, the consolidated revenues increased at a high single digits as a percentage. As a result of increased volumes, new product introductions and a solid pricing environment. From an operating income standpoint, we had significant increase of $44 million to a total operating income of $77 million. The segment benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. In terms of MWI, we are pleased with our overall operating margin as a result of higher companion animal revenues. And we are tracking right on schedule in terms of integrating the business and capturing synergies.  Finally, we're also very pleased with both consulting and World Courier to make solid income growth in the June quarter as a result of better-than-expected revenues. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants decreased to $2.4 billion as of June 30. This decrease in value was due primarily to the 6% decrease in the ABC share price from March 31st to June 30th. This decrease in the ABC share price also drew GAAP P&L credit of $15 million for the quarter. LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expense of $159 million. Our full year LIFO estimate is now revised at $602 million. This represents an increase of $254 million versus the prior year. The increase is due primarily to an expected higher annualized brand inflation rate, now estimated to be in the mid-teens. And also a slightly higher inventory balance through the overall business growth. 
This wraps up our P&L review. Let me switch and cover cash and capital deployment. This quarter, we had excellent free cash flow, nearly $1.1 billion, a record quarter for ABC. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues for the last 2 quarters and the benefits of scale helped to drive our improved working capital metrics. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.6 billion, which is very good, considering we paid down $250 million on our term loan. We also repurchased about $112 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program, bringing our year-to-date total under this program to $260 million. We also continue to make steady progress under our special share repurchase program. As you remember, this program is designed to cover our [indiscernible] hedging. This quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares for about $133 million. We also exercised half of the call options that we executed back in March 2015, meaning we purchased 3 million shares for $287 million. This quarter, we included a table in this morning earnings release that covers our warrant hedging progress. I ask that you refer to the table for details under coverage. We are pleased that we are now 100% hedged against our 2016 [ph] warrants, leading to our investors that we will avoid adjusted EPS dilution upon the first warrant exercise. As we go forward, we expect to deploy the appropriate capital to remain 100% hedged. Offering the  remaining -- offsetting the remaining potential warrant dilution on the 2017 warrants remains a top priority as we thoughtfully consider our capital deployment. 
Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our guidance. I am first going to provide updated guidance for fiscal '15 in a few key areas. Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $4.92 to $4.97, which reflects growth of 24% to 25% to last year's adjusted EPS. Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases increases to $300 million for the full year. And wrapping up with free cash flow, we now expect to be in the $3 billion range for the full year, driven primarily by our much improved generic revenue mix. 
Let me switch and provide a few additional details to follow up on these commentary on fiscal '16. One, based on trend. Including activity in July to date, we continue to see a slowdown in generic drug price inflation as a result of fewer drugs having price increases, in addition to generic price increases being more modest in comparison to recent history. Consequently, we have changed our view in this area and we are now expecting that the associated income contribution in fiscal '15 [ph] will be lower. Two, our working assumption is that property income and adjusted EPS growth will be higher in the second half of fiscal '16 given that we still have significant Department of Defense contract headwinds in the first 2 quarters of fiscal '16 [ph]. Also, these first 2 quarters we will have a tougher comparable related to generic price appreciation. And 3, our free cash flow is benefiting fiscal '15 due to the onetime ramping of the Walgreens generic business, which also gives us significant scale. We expect to see some moderation in the cash flow area in fiscal '16. 
As I wrap up my prepared comments, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. We are in the home stretch of fiscal '15 and we are very pleased with the progress we made to date. We will provide specific fiscal '16 [ph] guidance at our fourth quarter earnings call in late October. Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

I think the other we've done really well managing inventory levels through the summer. That certainly has helped us. So it's been a good story for ABC. In terms of next year, we won't have a moderation. We did have a onetime benefit this year earlier in the year on reducing inventory.

So it happens on the back end side, off in negotiations between PBM and manufacturers directly that don't repack our economics directly but accept that we are all industry because system and that ultimately it has an impact on prescription and pharmaceutical suppliers chain care. So just last comment I may make, a bigger question. On the generic side, we have massive mergers when you look at at all the work we have against us and others in health care has grown over the years and it can be that [indiscernible]. We are confident that the value that we provide to generic manufacturers will sustain through any combination and that is also true for branded manufacturers and hybrid models as well."

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release, our revenues increased 13%",2190,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release, our revenues increased 13% to $34.2 billion. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 19% to $1.2 billion, [indiscernible] $1.20, and we generated an exceptional $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our results were driven by solid performance across all of our core businesses and include a full quarter impact from MWI Veterinary Supply, which is performing better than expected. 
The progress we have made in strengthening our existing platforms and investing in new ones demonstrates our commitment to providing our customers and suppliers with market-leading solutions that enable us to collaboratively address the challenges of a cost-changing landscape. We constantly seek to expand our knowledge, reach and partnerships, in effort to drive innovation in both human and animal healthcare services. The quality of our offerings, a seamless execution and our disciplined capital management give us the flexibility to grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for manufacturers and healthcare provider customers, our stakeholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. 
Our excellent performance through the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 sets us up very well to meet our objectives for the full year. As expected, we have begun to face some headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2015, and we are beginning to anniversary many of the significant benefits of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. However, organic growth rate remained strong, especially strength [ph] than the overall market, and I feel our excellent portfolio of leading pharmaceutical services companies positions us extremely well to continue to take advantage of the opportunities across the entire pharmaceutical supply channel. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the June quarter. Holding on the exceptional momentum we had in the first half of our year, our performance in the third quarter was very solid. Strong revenue and gross profit growth, post excellent adjusted earnings per share growth and continuing improvement in working capital terms led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter with revenues up 9%, even as we continue to anniversary the on-boarding of the Walgreens business. Part of organic growth and strong brand drug pricing contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. While generic drug inflation is slowly increasing, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments.
We are very pleased that our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Next week, we will be hosting our annual trade show for our independent pharmacy customers in Las Vegas, and we are looking forward to presenting our enhanced offerings and new programs in this important customer segment. I've never been more excited about the opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists to impact the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. We have invested in several new initiatives that will enable us to offer independent pharmacies a set of enhanced capabilities that will support their efforts to improve patient care and to receive fair and accurate payments from payers with a new level of transparency. We are proud to be the advocate for community pharmacies to increasingly provide some of the most important touch points, ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care. And you'll be hearing more about how we will further empower their efforts and evolve our GNP network over the next few weeks. 
We're also very active with regulators and legislators, both independently and through our trade associations, who expertly advise and inform those important constituents on pertinent issues for our industry and our customers. 
We continue to be very pleased with the progress we have made in our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This unique industry-changing relationship has been both strategically and operationally important to ABC. 
Significantly as a customer, we continue to enjoy above-market growth from WBA this quarter. While we have almost fully anniversary-ed the on-boarding of the distribution business, we are not finished growing the relationship, and we are both focused on exploring additional ways to create new value points through WBAD and other shared opportunities. 
As our retail business is growing substantially over the last 2 years, we both have strong performance in our health systems and alternate site segments. During the quarter, we were very pleased to receive the Acute Distributor of the Year and the Mark McKenna Supplier of the Year award from Novation, which has been our valued partner for many years. I believe this recognition from Novation, the year of tremendous change for AmerisourceBergen highlights the tireless efforts our associates make every day to ensure that all of our customers are well served. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturing post changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 13%. our position in distribution business, ASD and our community oncology businesses all performed very well in the quarter. While reimbursement issues with ASP drive specific [ph], market leadership and credibility in the specialty company and their leaders enjoy in a continual source of pride and differentiation for AmerisourceBergen. I have worked with many of these leaders and associates, in some cases, 2 decades, and they are always passionate, constantly innovative and importantly remain very customer-centered. Their performance this year has been especially strong and positions us well to continue to thrive and be the leader in the specialty arena. The decades we have spent [indiscernible] developing our portfolio of specialty offerings, involving us the capabilities and expertise necessary to handle complex products and services that enabled us to play a leading role in dealing with products with special needs. Our capabilities extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and enter the distinct requirement for specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and healthcare providers manage their opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. 
Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biologic product, a generic version or of a mature therapy or a promising growth area, such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the expertise required to help ensure product success throughout the entire life cycle of a drug. It helps reform an over economic realities and even more focus on the specialty product statements.
AmerisourceBergen is best positioned to help our partners maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. Regarding biosimilars specifically, we continue to believe that their introduction to the U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further develop our -- demonstrate our strength in these areas, and we are not certain on the timing of specific product launches. While we remain excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new type of product, majority of the assets from biosimilars are still likely a ways off.
Of course, our collaborative efforts are no longer confined to the U.S. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we have expanded our international presence by improving the services we offer our manufacturer and provider customers. Both our BluePoint private label program and ABC Switzerland are progressing well, have demonstrated of an innovative services and solutions that will continue to develop in the years ahead. In addition, we are pleased with the progress we have made with our specialty joint venture in Brazil. The U.S., we continue to add new measure [indiscernible] in our programs, thanks to our National Distribution Center in Columbus. 
Wholesalers have never been more important to the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we move through a wave of customer and supplier consolidations, and the health care landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace, there is great opportunity for our industry and for AmerisourceBergen in particular to demonstrate the full value we can provide. 
Let's turn now to the other segments. As I mentioned earlier, this was the first time we had a full quarter of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and on the identification of synergies. I am very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and will make important contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel, as we expand our efforts into animal health. We continue to believe we acquired a first-class company, an organization of MWI. 
Jim Cleary and his team are the acknowledged leaders in this field and enthusiastic -- and are enthusiastic about the way they can further enhance the offering with the expanded opportunity under the ABC umbrella. Their willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their commitment to both outstanding execution and customer service bodes well for the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. 
Our manufacture services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access in its [indiscernible] programs, and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas is differentiated today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacture services businesses further expands our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer fully tailored global clinical and consulting solutions for virtually any specialty product launch in the developed world. 
It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, albeit driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, exceptional launches of new brand products and population demographics. 
Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and give pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, the increasing global demand for protein the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI as is part of the U.S. into developing global markets. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2015, we can expect the strong trends and overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Tim will provide more detail, but given the strength in our performance in the June quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year to $4.92 to $4.97, which represents outstanding growth of 24% to 25% over last year. As we look further ahead to fiscal 2016, it is too early to give detailed guidance, but we can see a path to earnings per share growth in the low teens. 
We are still working through our in-depth planning process, but there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we think you should bear in mind as you think about our growth rates for fiscal 2016. First, the tailwinds, continued solid organic revenue growth and brand drug inflation; secondly, better generic launches and 5 incremental max [ph] benefits from MWI acquisition. The headwinds are significant impact from DOD contract repricing in the first half of the year. Other customer renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016, include Kaiser late in the fiscal year and declining contribution from generic inflation. 
There are a few additional assumptions to concentrate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution for warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. We expect to repurchase $300 million in shares under our normal program. No contribution from M&A is planned in 2016 and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain hopeful that biosimilars are a great opportunity for ABC, particularly for the physician-administered products. But it's too difficult to predict the timing of any launches at this time. However, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong. I want to reiterate that these are preliminary results, and that we will give our detailed guidance when we report our fourth quarter in the fall. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to commend our ABC associates for delivering stellar performance through 9 months of fiscal 2015. Over the last few years, we have challenged our people to develop our talent in new leadership areas, both with our existing associates and by recruiting high-quality individuals externally, in order to ensure that we can grow our business while remain the partner of choice in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The value creation we generate is the result of our flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas. Our associates share my conviction that we make vital contributions to the health and well-being of humans and animals. And by selling in that role, we can continue to provide excellent returns through our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same p",1990,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. 
I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I will also cover a few consolidated cash flow highlights. The second topic, I will briefly recap our warrant hedging progress to date, and my third topic, I will wrap up with comments about guidance for fiscal year '15 and also provide some preliminary thoughts on fiscal '16. 
So with that, we can begin our Q3 review. Revenues increased $3.9 billion to $34.2 billion or 13%. On an overall basis, sales to Walgreens stores accounted for roughly 50% of our revenue dollar increase. As a reminder, this is now our third quarter of having this key customers business meeting all their brands and generic volumes for the entire quarter. Consequently, a majority of their growth continues to be related to year-over-year business ramping. Additionally, MWI contributed roughly 20% of our overall revenue dollar growth. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased $184 million or 22% to just over $1 billion. About 70% of the dollar growth came from our other segment, primarily as a result of adding a full quarter of MWI's result. The remaining dollar growth was from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by revenue growth. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased about $122 million or 28% to approximately $551 million. Consistent with a change in gross profit dollars that I just covered, the Other segment drove about 70% of the dollar growth, again primarily due to MWI. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $455 million, up about $52 million for a very strong 16% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.33%, up 3 basis points, due to adding MWI as they have a higher margin profile than our core drug businesses. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $28 million. And roughly half of the quarterly expense was related to the MWI acquisition financing. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 35.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. We continue to realize the decrease in our tax rate due to income growth in our international businesses. Additionally, this quarter, we realized about a 40 basis point improvement in our tax rate related to the filing of our 2014 tax return and recognizing a favorable tax provision to return adjustment. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 36.5%.  
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 19% to $1.20, driven by organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefit of a lower consolidated cash rate. Our adjusted diluted share count at 231.3 million shares was essentially flat to last year's quarter. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $32.8 billion, up 10%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company had growth in revenues of 9%, driven by 2 items. The first item, market growth continues to be good, driven by volume and strong pricing, especially in the brand drug side. I should note that sales of hepatitis C drugs did not contribute meaningfully to the overall revenue growth in our drug company. And the second item, we haven't anniversary-ed the full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize a revenue benefit here also. 
In terms of mix, drug company's total generic revenues increased year-over-year, just over 20% in dollars. Most of its increase is the result of servicing Walgreens fully this quarter, while last year, in the June 14 quarter, we were servicing about 70% of their locations for brands and generics. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of 22%. Similar to the past 2 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues through our drug company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 13% from higher volumes, of good pricing environment and new brand drug introductions. Specialty's growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs from our large businesses, ASD, Oncology Supply and Besse Medica. 
This is the fourth quarter in a row with dollar revenue growth in Oncology Supply, our business that focuses on serving community oncologists. These sales growth percentages for the drug company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we have reported each growth rate in past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $746 million, up about 8%. We saw a very good gross profit growth in our specialty business due to higher revenue growth. Our drug company had solid gross profit growth from higher revenues, but as discussed in the past, these contributions were negatively impacted by 2 items. One, the start of the Department of Defense contract that we renewed at a margin in line with market. And two, we had fewer generic drug price increases in the quarter. And our total dollar contribution from generic inflation was down somewhat sequentially through the March quarter and meaningfully compared to last year's quarter. 
Segment operating expenses were $368 million and were up about 11%. This increase is primarily related to payroll, delivery costs, depreciation and IT costs to support the segment's large volume growth and operational complexity. Additionally, we continue to ramp our National Distribution Center in Ohio and our Switzerland business. Both are performing well but are not yet fully optimized. 
Finally, operating expense also includes the additional incentive compensation accruals related to the strong year-to-date performance of the 2 business groups in this segment. Segment operating income was $378 million and up about 5%. Our specialty business group had good growth this quarter, offset by lower growth in our core drug business due to the items I just highlighted. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.5 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, though excluding MWI, the revenue growth would have been as a percentage in the mid-teens, with a majority of the revenue growth coming from our TheraCom distribution business and the remainder from our core consulting business, including Canada. 
MWI had a very good revenue quarter as a result of strong companion animal revenues. On a comparable basis to last year, the consolidated revenues increased in the high single digits as a percentage, as a result of increased volumes, new product introductions and a solid pricing environment. 
From an operating income standpoint, we had significant increase of $44 million to a total operating income of $77 million. The segment benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. In terms of MWI, we are pleased with our overall operating margin as a result of higher companion animal revenues. And we are tracking right on schedule in terms of integrating the business and capturing synergies.  
Finally, we're also very pleased with both Consulting and World Courier who had solid income growth in the June quarter as a result of better-than-expected revenues. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants decreased to $2.4 billion as of June 30. This decrease in value was due primarily to the 6% decrease in the ABC share price from March 31 to June 30. This decrease in the ABC share price also drove a GAAP P&L credit of $15 million for the quarter. 
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expense of $159 million. Our full year LIFO estimate is now revised at $602 million. This represents an increase of $254 million versus the prior year. The increase is due primarily to an expected higher annualized brand inflation rate, now estimated to be in the mid-teens, and also a slightly higher inventory balance to the overall business growth. 
This wraps up our P&L review. Let me switch and cover cash and capital deployment. This quarter, we had excellent free cash flow, nearly $1.1 billion, a record quarter for ABC. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues for the last 2 quarters and the benefits of scale helped to drive our improved working capital metrics. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.6 billion, which is very good, considering we paid down $250 million on our term loan. We also repurchased about $112 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program, bringing our year-to-date total under this program to $260 million. We also continue to make steady progress under our special share repurchase program. As you remember, this program is designed to cover our warrant hedging. This quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares for about $133 million. We also exercised half of the call options that we executed back in March 2015, meaning we purchased 3 million shares for $287 million. 
This quarter, we included a table in this morning earnings release that covers our warrant hedging progress. I've asked that you refer to the table for the details under coverage. We are pleased that we are now 100% hedged against our 2016 warrant, meaning to our investors that we will avoid adjusted EPS dilution upon the first warrant exercise. As we go forward, we expect to deploy the appropriate capital to remain 100% hedged. Offering the remaining -- offsetting the remaining potential warrant dilution on the 2017 warrant remains a top priority as we thoughtfully consider our capital deployment. 
Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our guidance. I'm first going to provide updated guidance for fiscal '15 in a few key areas. Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $4.92 to $4.97, which reflects growth of 24% to 25% from last year's adjusted EPS. 
Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases increases to $300 million for the full year. 
And wrapping up with free cash flow, we now expect to be in the $3 billion range for the full year, driven primarily by our much improved generic revenue mix. 
Let me switch and provide a few additional details to follow up on these commentary on fiscal '16. One, based on trends. Including activity in July to date, we continue to see a slowdown in generic drug price inflation as a result of fewer drugs having price increases, in addition to generic price increases being more modest in comparison to recent history. Consequently, we have changed our view in this area, and we are now expecting that the associated income contribution in fiscal '15 will be lower. Two, our working assumption is that property income and adjusted EPS growth will be higher in the second half of fiscal '16, given that we still have significant Department of Defense contract headwind the first 2 quarters of fiscal '16. Also, these first 2 quarters, we will have a tougher comparable related to generic price appreciation. And three, our free cash flow is benefiting in fiscal '15 due to the onetime ramping of the Walgreens generic business, which also gives us significant scale. We expect to see some moderation in the cash flow area in fiscal '16. 
As I wrap up my prepared comments, I want to thank you for your time and your attention this morning. We are in the home stretch of fiscal '15, and we are very pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will provide specific fiscal '16 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in late October. 
Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

I think the other -- we've done really well in managing inventory levels through the summer. That certainly has helped us. So it's been a good story for ABC. In terms of next year, we will have a moderation. We did have a onetime benefit this year, earlier in the year on reducing inventory. But I think at this point, still a lot of moving parts. And we're saying for '16, we'll see a moderation, but I don't think we really want to quantify it yet. We're still trying to finish up our planning process."

They are great strategic and operational benefits to our company and also, a very strong culture. If you look back, I'm just reflecting on this in my remarks, in my prepared remarks, Oncology Supply is almost 20 years ago since we bought it, and they're worth $7 million. It's pretty remarkable. And then 2 years off of that, it was ION, Lash, Stacie [ph]. We started ASD, ICS. And we also quite said then it's not only the contributions from those businesses, it's a contribution from the people that we brought in. So -- and now we see this with some of the people we've brought in from World Courier and MWI as well, which is a larger organization. So it's bringing in the right mix of culture, people that are going to associate with the core business.

And we -- this is an area -- I think our industry, as a whole, has been the best friend that community pharmacy has. And some of the programs and services that we offer really do enable them to compete in a more challenging industry, but also with opportunities, say, from 82% of the scripts being generics with some of the specialty products, like the new [indiscernible] drugs being in community. So there are definitely going to be opportunities for them to access patients. We're also working very hard on the regulatory front. But we've got a lot of work, and we have [indiscernible] leader our drug company, who really comes from an analytics and consultative background. And we're doing a lot of work to understanding exactly what our customers value, and what they want help with is reimbursement, making sure that they get everything that they're entitled to, the merchandising front. We -- our family works for the Good Neighbor Pharmacy here in the area in Philadelphia we live in. I was actually there yesterday because we just did transformation there. And I said you -- I was talking to a patient there, a Medicare patient, and he was just saying -- he was saying, ""This is the guy who brought the people in. These are the guys who brought the people in to help make us sort of like [indiscernible]."" She just about gave me a hug and said, ""Thank you."" I mean, it just looks fantastic. The pharmacists said to me, I really know how to take care of my patients. I know how to run back into the store. A lot of merchandiser don't do the front end of the store. That's why you guys have helped make it look very professional, very bright, organized it. For example, they never had a quality [ph] station before. So we have the whole American green card is coming in. They've got a whole section there, and you could really like -- and they have a -- we never had a start [ph] poster before with anniversaries, what was birthdays. So all that is there now, and we did that all for the pharmacy. So just a very pragmatic illustration of the sort of things that we do and our industry does. And it's very, very value-creating. And hopefully, it gains us a lot of loyalty from our customers. And then we have the tools. You're also reasoning, for example, the insight there was showing me what that has made to is practice as he's able to track how scripts are managed from a 30-day to a 90-day script. So very, very interesting. And last, we've had in BC [ph]. One of the things that Rita [ph] have said, I've said this to you before on these calls, Rita [ph] thanked us for being a good advocate for our customers and helping share their issues. They've said no other companies, large companies coming here and talk about their customers as much as you do. So I think we try very hard. I think our customers appreciate it. Attendance next week will be up 13% So we're looking forward to -- actually, some -- it will be a very significant increase in the level of services and offerings that we have, with Dave Neu taking full time over the Good Neighbor Pharmacy position. I think you're going to see a whole lot of innovation and new ideas and new services, what we call the next level of Good Neighbor Pharmacy services. So thanks for the question. We're excited as you can tell. I probably took too long to answer that question. But I'm very excited about what we are going to be doing in this area."

And last month, Barbara and Tim and I were in London, and we got a lot of these questions because we arrived there at the time when, of course, [indiscernible] consolidation. So I think, first of all, consolidation, in a way, is a simplified number of parties to talk to and work on programs. There is no doubt that we're in the midst post the Affordable Care Act implementation, a significant change in our industry. And it's important for large companies like AmerisourceBergen to participate and again give that voice to the smaller customers. And we can provide oncologists. We can provide care onto care providers. We think about community pharmacists. And then when we think about also working within trade associations, our more -- our larger customers, like our PBM customer and our large-chain customer, to make sure that their issues get voiced and -- but in short, I think the scale and efficiency that we continue to provide will always be ratcheted up. That's not a surprise there. That's what we've done for decades. And the services that we provide need to be more thoughtful, new and provide new efficiencies for the customers. That's why comments about the talent that we have and knowledge of the market and the role of the wholesaler that we made our people are very pertinent. Just one thing that I think is worth mentioning, a lot of what goes on with rebating and contracting on pharmacy items is post our billing. So it happens on the back-end side, often negotiations between PBM and manufacturers directly that don't impact our economics directly but accept that we're all in the same ecosystem. And that ultimately does have an impact on prescription and pharmaceutical suppliers chain care. So just last comment and then maybe Tim because it is a big question. On the generic side, we've been through these massive mergers. You look at all the work that Alex Gourlay [ph] has done and others and health care has grown over the years and [indiscernible], and it can be like [indiscernible]. We're confident that the value that we provide to generic manufacturers will sustain through any combination, and that's also true for branded manufacturers and hybrid models as well."

I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release, our revenues increased 13%",2192,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release, our revenues increased 13% to $34.2 billion. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 19% to $1.2 billion, [indiscernible] $1.20, and we generated an exceptional $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our results were driven by solid performance across all of our core businesses and include a full quarter impact from MWI Veterinary Supply, which is performing better than expected. 
The progress we have made in strengthening our existing platforms and investing in new ones demonstrates our commitment to providing our customers and suppliers with market-leading solutions that enable us to collaboratively address the challenges of a cost-changing landscape. We constantly seek to expand our knowledge, reach and partnerships, in effort to drive innovation in both human and animal healthcare services. The quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our disciplined capital management give us the flexibility to grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for manufacturers and healthcare provider customers, our stakeholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. 
Our excellent performance through the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 sets us up very well to meet our objectives for the full year. As expected, we have begun to face some headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2015, and we are beginning to anniversary many of the significant benefits of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. However, organic growth rate remained strong, especially strength [ph] faster than the overall market, and I feel our excellent portfolio of leading pharmaceutical services companies positions us extremely well to continue to take advantage of the opportunities across the entire pharmaceutical supply channel. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the June quarter. Holding on the exceptional momentum we had in the first half of our year, our performance in the third quarter was very solid. Strong revenue and gross profit growth, post excellent adjusted earnings per share growth and continuing improvement in working capital terms led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter with revenues up 9%, even as we continue to anniversary the on-boarding of the Walgreens business. Part of organic growth and strong brand drug pricing contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. While generic drug inflation has slowed meaningfully, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments.
We are very pleased that our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Next week, we will be hosting our annual trade show for our independent pharmacy customers in Las Vegas, and we are looking forward to presenting our enhanced offerings and new programs to this important customer segment. 
I've never been more excited about the opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists to impact the delivery of health care in the U.S. We have invested in several new initiatives that will enable us to offer independent pharmacies a set of enhanced capabilities that will support their efforts to improve patient care and to receive fair and accurate payments from payers with a new level of transparency. We are proud to be the advocate for community pharmacies to increasingly provide some of the most important touch points, ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care. And you'll be hearing more about how we will further empower their efforts and evolve our GNP network over the next few weeks. 
We're also very active with regulators and legislators, both independently and through our trade associations, who expertly advise and inform those important constituents on pertinent issues for our industry and our customers. 
We continue to be very pleased with the progress we have made in our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This unique industry-changing relationship has been both strategically and operationally important to ABC. 
Significantly as a customer, we continue to enjoy above-market growth from WBA this quarter. While we have almost fully anniversary-ed the on-boarding of the distribution business, we are not finished growing the relationship, and we are both focused on exploring additional ways to create new value points through WBAD and other shared opportunities. 
As our retail business is growing substantially over the last 2 years, we both have strong performance in our health systems and alternate site segments. During the quarter, we were very pleased to receive the Acute Distributor of the Year and the Mark McKenna Supplier of the Year award from Novation, which has been our valued partner for many years. I believe this recognition from Novation, the year of tremendous change for AmerisourceBergen highlights the tireless efforts our associates make every day to ensure that all of our customers are well served. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturing post changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 13%. Our position in distribution business, ASD and our community oncology businesses all performed very well in the quarter. While reimbursement issues were ASP driver-specific, market leadership and credibility, the specialty company and their leaders enjoy, is a continual source of pride and differentiation for AmerisourceBergen. I have worked with many of these leaders and associates, in some cases, 2 decades, and they are always passionate, constantly innovative and importantly remain very customer-centered. Their performance this year has been especially strong and positions us well to continue to thrive and be the leader in the specialty arena. 
The decades we have spent thoughtfully developing our portfolio of specialty offerings, and bolting up the capabilities and expertise necessary to handle complex products and services have enabled us to play a leading role in dealing with products with special needs. Our capabilities extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and enter the distinct requirement for specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and healthcare providers manage their opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. 
Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biologic product, a generic version or of a mature therapy or a promising growth area, such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the expertise required to help ensure product success throughout the entire life cycle of a drug. With health reform and other economic realities, we're even more focused on the specialty product statements.
AmerisourceBergen is best positioned to help our partners maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. Regarding biosimilars specifically, we continue to believe that their introduction to the U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further develop our -- demonstrate our strength in these areas, and we are not certain on the timing of specific product launches. While we remain excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new type of product, majority of the benefits from biosimilars are still likely a ways off.
Of course, our collaborative efforts are no longer confined to the U.S. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we have expanded our international presence by improving the services we offer our manufacturer and provider customers. Both our BluePoint private label program and ABC Switzerland are progressing well and are demonstrative of the innovative services and solutions that we'll continue to develop in the years ahead. In addition, we are pleased with the progress we have made with our specialty joint venture in Brazil. Concerning the U.S., we continue to add new measure [indiscernible] in our programs, thanks to our National Distribution Center in Columbus. 
Wholesalers have never been more important to the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we move through a wave of customer and supplier consolidations, and the health care landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace, there is great opportunity for our industry and for AmerisourceBergen in particular to demonstrate the full value we can provide. 
Let's turn now to the other segments. As I mentioned earlier, this was the first time we had a full quarter of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and on the identification of synergies. I am very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and will make important contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel, as we expand our efforts into animal health. We continue to believe we acquired a first-class company, an organization of MWI. 
Jim Cleary and his team are the acknowledged leaders in this field and enthusiastic -- and are enthusiastic about the way they can further enhance their offering with the expanded opportunity under the ABC umbrella. Their willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their commitment to both outstanding execution and customer service bodes well for the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. 
Our manufacture services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs, and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas is differentiated today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacture services businesses further expands our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer fully tailored global clinical and consulting solutions for virtually any specialty product launch in the developed world. 
It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, exceptional launches of new brand products and population demographics. 
Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and give pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, the increasing global demand for protein drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise in MWI as part of the U.S. into developing global markets. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2015, we can expect the strong trends and overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Tim will provide more detail, but given the strength in our performance in the June quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year to $4.92 to $4.97, which represents outstanding growth of 24% to 25% over last year. As we look further ahead to fiscal 2016, it is too early to give detailed guidance, but we can see a path to earnings per share growth in the low teens. 
We are still working through our in-depth planning process, but there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we think you should bear in mind as you think about our growth rates for fiscal 2016. First, the tailwinds, continued solid organic revenue growth and brand drug inflation; secondly, better generic launches and 5 incremental match benefits from MWI acquisition. The headwinds are significant impact from DOD contract repricing in the first half of the year. Other customer renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016 include Kaiser late in the fiscal year and declining contribution from generic inflation. 
There are a few additional assumptions to contemplate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution for warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. We expect to repurchase $300 million in shares under our normal program. No contribution from M&A is planned in 2016 and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain hopeful that biosimilars are a great opportunity for ABC, particularly for the physician-administered products. But it's too difficult to predict the timing of any launches at this time. However, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. I want to reiterate that these are preliminary results, and that we will give our detailed guidance when we report our fourth quarter in the fall. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to commend our ABC associates for delivering stellar performance through 9 months of fiscal 2015. Over the last few years, we have challenged our people to develop our talent in new leadership areas, both with our existing associates and by recruiting high-quality individuals externally, in order to ensure that we can grow our business while remaining the partner of choice in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The value creation we generate is the result of our flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas. Our associates share my conviction that we make vital contributions to the health and well-being of humans and animals. And by selling in that role, we can continue to provide excellent returns through our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same p",1990,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. 
I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I will also cover a few consolidated cash flow highlights. The second topic, I will briefly recap our warrant hedging progress to date, and my third topic, I will wrap up with comments about guidance for fiscal year '15 and also provide some preliminary thoughts on fiscal '16. 
So with that, we can begin our Q3 review. Revenues increased $3.9 billion to $34.2 billion, up 13%. On an overall basis, sales to Walgreens stores accounted for roughly 50% of our revenue dollar increase. As a reminder, this is now our third quarter of having this key customers business meeting all their brands and generic volumes for the entire quarter. Consequently, a majority of their growth continues to be related to year-over-year business ramping. Additionally, MWI contributed roughly 20% of our overall revenue dollar growth. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased $184 million or 22% to just over $1 billion. About 70% of the dollar growth came from our other segment, primarily as a result of adding a full quarter of MWI's results. The remaining dollar growth was from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by revenue growth. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased about $122 million or 28% to approximately $551 million. Consistent with a change in gross profit dollars that I just covered, the Other segment drove about 70% of the dollar growth, again, primarily due to MWI. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $455 million, up about $52 million for a very strong 16% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.33%, up 3 basis points, due to adding MWI as they have a higher margin profile than our core drug businesses. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $28 million. And roughly half of the quarterly expense was related to the MWI acquisition financing. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 35.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. We continue to realize the decrease in our tax rate due to income growth in our international businesses. Additionally, this quarter, we realized about a 40 basis point improvement in our tax rate related to the filing of our 2014 tax return and recognizing a favorable tax provision to return adjustment. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 36.5%. 
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 19% to $1.20, driven by organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefit of a lower consolidated tax rate. Our adjusted diluted share count at 231.3 million shares was essentially flat to last year's quarter. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $32.8 billion, up 10%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company had growth in revenues of 9%, driven by 2 items. The first item, market growth continues to be good, driven by volume and strong pricing, especially in the brand drug side. I should note that sales of hepatitis C drugs did not contribute meaningfully to the overall revenue growth in our drug company. And the second item, we haven't anniversary-ed the full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize a revenue benefit here also. 
In terms of mix, drug company's total generic revenues increased year-over-year, just over 20% in dollars. Most of its increase is the result of servicing Walgreens fully this quarter, while last year, in the June '14 quarter, we were servicing about 70% of their locations for brands and generics. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of 22%. Similar to the past 2 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our drug company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 13% from higher volumes, a good pricing environment and new brand drug introductions. Specialty's growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs from our large businesses, ASD, Oncology Supply and Besse Medica. 
This is the fourth quarter in a row with solid revenue growth in Oncology Supply, our business that focuses on serving community oncologists. These sales growth percentages for the drug company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we have reported each growth rate in past quarters. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $746 million, up about 8%. We saw a very good gross profit growth in our specialty business due to higher revenue growth. Our drug company had solid gross profit growth from higher revenues, but as discussed in the past, these contributions were negatively impacted by 2 items. One, the start of the Department of Defense contract that we renewed at a margin in line with market. And two, we had fewer generic drug price increases in the quarter. And our total dollar contribution from generic inflation was down somewhat sequentially for the March quarter and meaningfully compared to last year's quarter. 
Segment operating expenses were $368 million and were up about 11%. This increase is primarily related to payroll, delivery costs, depreciation and IT costs to support the segment's large volume growth and operational complexity. Additionally, we continue to ramp our National Distribution Center in Ohio and our Switzerland business. Both are performing well but are not yet fully optimized. 
Finally, operating expense also includes the additional incentive compensation accruals related to the strong year-to-date performance of the 2 business groups in this segment. Segment operating income was $378 million and up about 5%. Our specialty business group had good growth this quarter, offset by lower growth in our core drug business due to the items I just highlighted. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.5 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, the revenue growth would have been as a percentage in the mid-teens, with a majority of the revenue growth coming from our TheraCom distribution business and the remainder from our core consulting business, including Canada. 
MWI had a very good revenue quarter as a result of strong companion animal revenues. On a comparable basis to last year, the consolidated revenues increased in the high single digits as a percentage, as a result of increased volumes, new product introductions and a solid pricing environment. 
From an operating income standpoint, we had significant increase of $44 million to a total operating income of $77 million. The segment benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. In terms of MWI, we are pleased with our overall operating margin as a result of higher companion animal revenues. And we are tracking right on schedule in terms of integrating the business and capturing synergies. 
Finally, we're also very pleased with both Consulting and World Courier who had solid income growth in the June quarter as a result of better-than-expected revenues. 
This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants decreased to $2.4 billion as of June 30. This decrease in value was due primarily to the 6% decrease in the ABC share price from March 31 to June 30. This decrease in the ABC share price also drove a GAAP P&L credit of $15 million for the quarter. 
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expense of $159 million. Our full year LIFO estimate is now revised at $602 million. This represents an increase of $254 million versus the prior year. The increase is due primarily to an expected higher annualized brand inflation rate, now estimated to be in the mid-teens, and also a slightly higher inventory balance to the overall business growth. 
This wraps up our P&L review. Let me switch and cover cash and capital deployment. This quarter, we had excellent free cash flow, nearly $1.1 billion, a record quarter for ABC. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues for the last 2 quarters and the benefits of scale helped to drive our improved working capital metrics. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.6 billion, which is very good, considering we paid down $250 million on our term loan. We also repurchased about $112 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program, bringing our year-to-date total under this program to $260 million. 
We also continue to make steady progress under our special share repurchase program. As you remember, this program is designed to cover our warrant hedging. This quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares for about $133 million. We also exercised half of the call options that we executed back in March 2015, meaning we purchased 3 million shares for $287 million. 
This quarter, we included a table in this morning earnings release that covers our warrant hedging progress. I'd ask that you refer to the table for the details under coverage. We are pleased that we are now 100% hedged against our 2016 warrant, meaning to our investors that we will avoid adjusted EPS dilution upon the first warrant exercise. As we go forward, we expect to deploy the appropriate capital to remain 100% hedged. Offering the remaining -- offsetting the remaining potential warrant dilution on the 2017 warrant remains a top priority as we thoughtfully consider our capital deployment. 
Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our guidance. I'm first going to provide updated guidance for fiscal '15 in a few key areas. Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $4.92 to $4.97, which reflects growth of 24% to 25% from last year's adjusted EPS. 
Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases increases to $300 million for the full year. 
And wrapping up with free cash flow, we now expect to be in the $3 billion range for the full year, driven primarily by our much improved generic revenue mix. 
Let me switch and provide a few additional details to follow up on these commentary on fiscal '16. One, based on trends. Including activity in July to date, we continue to see a slowdown in generic drug price inflation as a result of fewer drugs having price increases, in addition to generic price increases being more modest in comparison to recent history. Consequently, we have changed our view in this area, and we are now expecting that the associated income contribution in fiscal '16 will be lower. Two, our working assumption is that property income and adjusted EPS growth will be higher in the second half of fiscal '16, given that we still have significant Department of Defense contract headwind the first 2 quarters of fiscal '16. Also, these first 2 quarters, we will have a tougher comparable related to generic price appreciation. And three, our free cash flow is benefiting in fiscal '15 due to the onetime ramping of the Walgreens generic business, which also gives us significant scale. We expect to see some moderation in the cash flow area in fiscal '16. 
As I wrap up my prepared comments, I want to thank you for your time and your attention this morning. We are in the home stretch of fiscal '15, and we are very pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will provide specific fiscal '16 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in late October. 
Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

I think the other -- we've done really well in managing inventory levels through the summer. That certainly has helped us. So it's been a good story for ABC. In terms of next year, we will have a moderation. We did have a onetime benefit this year, earlier in the year on reducing inventory. But I think at this point, still a lot of moving parts. And we're saying for '16, we'll see a moderation, but I don't think we really want to quantify it yet. We're still trying to finish up our planning process."

If you look back, I'm just reflecting on this in my remarks, in my prepared remarks, Oncology Supply is almost 20 years ago since we bought it, and they're worth $7 million. It's pretty remarkable. And then 2 years after that, it was ION, Lash, Stacie [ph]. We started ASD, ICS. And we also quite said then it's not only the contributions from those businesses, it's a contribution from the people that we brought in. So -- and now we see this with some of the people we've brought in from World Courier and MWI as well, which is a larger organization. So it's bringing in the right mix of culture, people that are going to associate with the core business.

Our thesis that we can add value to a company that has some presence in specialty distribution in Brazil was the market that we chose to really invest behind.

So there are definitely going to be opportunities for them to access patients. We're also working very hard on the regulatory front. But we've done a lot of work, and we have Bob Mauch, the leader our drug company, who really comes from an analytics and consultative background. And we're doing a lot of work to understanding exactly what our customers value, and what they want help with is reimbursement, making sure that they get everything that they're entitled to, the merchandising front. We -- our family works for the Good Neighbor Pharmacy here in the area in Philadelphia we live in. I was actually there yesterday because we just did transformation there. And I said you -- I was talking to a patient there, a Medicare patient, and he was just saying -- he was saying, ""This is the guy who brought the people in. These are the guys who brought the people in to help make us sort of like [indiscernible]."" She just about gave me a hug and said, ""Thank you."" I mean, it just looks fantastic. The pharmacists said to me, I really know how to take care of my patients. I know how to run back-end of the store. A lot of merchandiser don't do the front end of the store. That's why you guys have helped make it look very professional, very bright, organized it. For example, they never had a card station before. So we have the whole American green card is coming in. They've got a whole section there, and you could really like -- and they have a -- they never had a staff person before who does [ph] anniversaries, or if it was birthdays. So all that is there now, and we did that all for the pharmacy. So just a very pragmatic illustration of the sort of things that we do and our industry does. And it's very, very value-creating. And hopefully, it gains us a lot of loyalty from our customers. And then we have the tools. You're also recently, for example, the inside there [ph] was showing me what that has made to is practice as he's able to track how scripts are managed from a 30-day to a 90-day script. So very, very interesting. And last week I was in , we've had in D.C. One of the things that regulators said, I've said this to you before on these calls, regulators thank us for being a good advocate for our customers and helping share their issues. They've said no other companies, large companies come in here and talk about their customers as much as you do. So I think we try very hard. I think our customers appreciate it. Our attendance next week will be up 13% So we're looking forward to -- actually, some -- it will be a very significant increase in the level of services and offerings that we have, with Dave Neu taking full time over the Good Neighbor Pharmacy position. I think you're going to see a whole lot of innovation and new ideas and new services, what we call the next level of Good Neighbor Pharmacy services. So thanks for the question.

So I think, first of all, consolidation, in a way, is a simplified number of parties to talk to and work on programs. There is no doubt that we're in the midst post the Affordable Care Act implementation of a significant change in our industry. And it's important for large companies like AmerisourceBergen to participate and again give that voice to the smaller customers. And we think about oncologists. We think about care -- long term care providers. We think about community pharmacists, et cetera. And then when we think about also working within trade associations, our more -- our larger customers, like our PBM customers and our large-chain customers, to make sure that their issues get voiced and. But in short, I think the scale and efficiency that we continue to provide will always be ratcheted up. That's not a surprise to us. That's what we've done for decades. And the services that we provide need to be more thoughtful, new and provide new efficiencies for the customers. That's why the comments about the talent that we have and knowledge of the market and the role of the wholesaler that we made our people are very pertinent. Just one thing that I think is worth mentioning, a lot of what goes on with rebating and contracting on pharmacy items is post our billing. So it happens on the back-end side, often in negotiations between PBM and manufacturers directly that don't impact our economics directly but accept that we're all in the same ecosystem. And that ultimately this has an impact on prescription and pharmaceutical suppliers chain care. So just last comment and then maybe Tim because it is a big question. On the generic side, we've been through these massive mergers. You look at all the work that Allergan has done and others and health care has grown over the years and [indiscernible], and a company like [indiscernible]. We're confident that the value that we provide to generic manufacturers will sustain through any combination, and that's also true for branded manufacturers and hybrid models as well."

We've actually changed locations within our headquarters here, so the train should not be very prominent today, and I assure you all appreciate that. I am just tremendously proud of the results that we are presenting today and I commend our highly engaged associates with the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieve this year. Our success is being driven by the approach we take to the market today. We constantly seek our initiative, we're going to take expense initiative to the ourselves of the opportunities that we see unfolding, and we work collaboratively and creatively to address challenges reach in front of us and the causes in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed, our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing innovative solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers. Our results are a testament of the precision and proficiency with which we run our business and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders. 
In financial terms, we see that all of our expectations for fiscal year 2015. Our revenues for the full year were up 14% to $136 million and adjusted earnings per share from continued operations -- from continuing operations were up 25% to $4.96. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong this year, coming in at a record $3.7 billion. The strength of our financial position enable us to make important strategic investments, including the acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply, and most recently, the pending acquisition of PharMEDium. The position of these 2 high-quality assets to AmerisourceBergen portfolio demonstrates our commitment to the pharmaceutical supply channel and the opportunities we see inherent in it. It also highlights our ability to extend our existing capability into new markets and to continuously enhance the services we are able to provide to our existing customers. We could not have made these 2 significant investments in the same calendar year if we did not have tremendous confidence in our ability to manage complex diverse businesses that enhance the level of range and services that we provide to the market. Moreover, in addition to making these investments, we have also made substantial progress in [indiscernible], the expected impact of warrant exercises we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. At this stage, e essentially completely offset the impact of the warrants and I'm very proud that we have been able to perform the commitment which we made to our shareholders when we first entered into the long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This relationship, which will be coming up to our 3-year anniversary, has thus far been a tremendous success, and we look forward to many more benefits in the years ahead. We selected WBA as our long-term partner not only for cultural fit but also because we believe long-term partner for us in the retail chain space and certainly their performances our largest customer and sourcing partner has been a very significant contributor to our performance over the last few years. 
Our operational execution is also very strong this year. All our customers have benefited from enhancements we have made to our infrastructure, and we have certainly been realizing the benefits of the increasing set of our business where we have more than doubled the number of lives we manage over the last 25 months. We have also continued to execute on our advanced programs and services from manufacturing customers, including those provided by AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. While we have substantially strengthened our whole business over the last 2 years, we always feel like we can and should do better. Our customers are being challenged, and they want and should expect that we should step up in new and innovative ways as well. But this is what excites and motivates our team. We also continue to work on the associate experience part of our business and I feel that we are not only attracting and importantly, retaining exceptional talents, but we are being recognized for our culture in the marketplace. Just this week, we were named one of the coolest places to work in Philadelphia, by Philadelphia Magazine, not that you can put this in our EPS guidance, but it's still a recognition we are proud of. 
For many, many years, wholesale is proven to be one of the most resilient and reliable components of the pharmaceutical channel. Over the last 2 years, our entire industry has successfully transformed itself in order to better address the changing and consolidating needs of the health care landscape. Wholesale is proven to be adept at providing value that goes well beyond the essential services of aggregating demand and the logistics of getting products from 1 point to another safely and security. We help enable efficient pharmaceutical care in the widest possible access to products, which allows our customers to focus on expertly caring for their patients. 
It remains an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are solid. Health reform initiatives continue to improve access to care and new and innovative products are coming to market. Through recent years, we have seen new products come to market that dramatically improve the lives of patients and often in cost effective ways. The R&D top line remains full of promising product and the combination of advanced therapies, and improving exits to care, not only drives growth opportunity but most importantly, meaningfully increase patient lives. The high percentage of generic prescription in the market also help pharmaceutical care given greater driver of efficient health care for the many of the therapies we deliver. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely good position to help ensure products get to markets as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapy across all sites of care. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. Tim will provide the financial details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter, with revenues of 8% even as we continue to fully anniversary the on-boarding of the Walgreens business. Our growth was driven in large part by solid organic volume growth. While generic drug inflation has slowed meaningfully over the course of the year, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chains, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Last quarter, I spoke about enhancements we have made to our programs for our independent pharmacy customers. The opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists to delivery of health care in the U.S. would be an important contributor to our growth going forward. For many years, we have been proud advocates for community pharmacies that increasingly provide some of the most important touch points to ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care. We also remain active with regulators and legislators both independently and through our trade associations to expertly advice and inform those important constituents on important issues in our industry and our customers, especially with respect to issues regarding the safety and security of the pharmaceutical supply channel. But the close of the September quarter, we have now fully anniversary-ed the on-boarding of the Walgreens distribution business. Since the implementation of this historic contribution contract, Walgreens has exceeded our internal growth estimates as the customer, this quarter, this year and last year. As our retail business has grown substantially over the last 2 fiscal years, we also had strong performance in our health system and [indiscernible]. In early October, we were very pleased to announce the [indiscernible] agreement to acquire PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. This acquisition represents an important investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to our health system customers. A customer segment that has played an increasingly important role in its tradition of health care in the U.S. PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality CSPs in key therapeutic orders, areas, combined with the impressive track record of growth made them a compelling addition to ABDC. Because [indiscernible] PharMEDium to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and we expect the transaction to close during the first quarter, we have included anticipated contribution from PharMEDium and the guidance we are giving for 2016 today. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact to some previously reported manufacturing imposed changes on certain oncology products which moved some revenue from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up an impressive 13% [ph]. Our physician distribution businesses, ASP, and our Community Oncology business, all performed very well in the quarter. We continue to be very confident and proud of our specialty franchise. Our market leadership in this area is rooted in customer intimacy and deep experience. This important knowledge has been an inspiration for investments we have made in this business and the portfolio of service we have developed over many years. Our capability to extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and enter the distinct requirements with specific disease states and unique [indiscernible] of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. Our belief is the true differentiator of our specialty business is our collaborative approach to bringing innovative solutions to both our physician and manufacture customers. Working in concept with our business partners is a best way to both discover and deliver value in the long run, especially in the marketplace that is increasingly focused on the cost of care. During the year, our GSMR global supply manufacturer relations business unit based principally out of Bern, Switzerland, was announced as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, has made important inroads in the brand, specialty, generic and consumer area to establish an even greater level of professionals and coordination between suppliers and our customers. This also includes an almost 24/7 communication rhythm with our partners that we've had. 
Let's turn now to the other segments. We had a full quarter of MWI in our results and we're very pleased with their performance. We've made excellent progress on their integration. We've made most animal health manufacturers and made good progress on identification of synergies. One area where we see a lot of opportunity is in sharing enhancing technology, not just in our warehouse and distribution centers but also in the systems and proven methodologies with which we interact with customers and suppliers. We have made a few tuck-in acquisitions in this area, specifically over the last several months, and while they are small relative to the size of our total business, they are very important to the future of the animal health platform. The companion animal business was especially strong in the September quarter with growth in the low teens. I had to say that with just 7 [indiscernible] months on our belt, we are delighted by how the MWI integration into ABC has gone. Moreover we feel very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016 and will make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we add this complex new segment to our business. MWI's willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and the ongoing commitment to outstanding execution and customer service gives us great confidence in the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. 
Our manufacture services business also had a solid September quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and inherent program and experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacturer services and clinical trial logistics business further expand our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high value pharmaceutical products launched in most of the developed world. As I've said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segment. Better economic conditions help perform initiatives and successful launches of their brand products and population demographics drive organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmacy market. Advances in veterinary medicine improve the quality-of-life of companion animals and give owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, increasing global demand for [indiscernible] drive the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has gone in the U.S. and to developing global markets. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, and as I mentioned, last quarter, there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we ask you to bear in mind just we think about our growth rates next year. Some of this cover the specifics of our expectations but I want to highlight a few areas. First, the tailwinds. Continued solid organic revenue growth, driven primarily by customer and product mix. Better generic launch outlooks and far much incremental benefit from MWI. The headwinds are significant impact from DoD contracts repricing in the first-half of this recently [indiscernible] fiscal year. Other customer contract renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016, notably Kaiser, whose contract expires late in the fiscal year and as we've shared before, that contract would be 7 years from when we first entered into this generation of contract. Third, declining dollar contribution from generic inflation. No onetime benefits from some of the cash flow drivers we experienced in fiscal year 2015. 
There are a few additional assumptions to contemplate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution from warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. $0.22 to $0.26 of net contribution from PharMEDium and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain confident that biosimilars are an exciting opportunity for ABC and the market. As discussed before, we believe we would have a particularly strong role, especially in the physician administrative advice of new products. The challenges remain on the legal and regulatory side which prevent [indiscernible] quick contribution to ABC in the short to medium-term. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to take a moment to thank our associates for delivering excellent performance in fiscal 2015. Our value creation is result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas and our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is focused. I share my conviction that doing things efficiently and being an expanding and dynamic channel partner with a view to the future, would be what sets ABC apart. The always-improving quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our [indiscernible] capital management I'll help us go our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term by the for our manufacturer and health care provider customers. Our shareholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. Now here is Tim."

As Steve mentioned, we completed another excellent year in ABC. Let me spend a minute and quickly recap a few highlights. Our drug company executed extremely well this year. They finished the fiscal year spending internal records for both product service levels and order accuracy through all those customers. Our Specialty Group continues to grow and execute as well. They had their best revenue growth year in the last 8 years with all the businesses in the portfolio contributing. We added MWI and are in process of acquiring PharMEDium. Both are respected leaders with high market shares and both have excellent long-term business prospects. Finally, we exit the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet while virtually eliminating the expected impact of the dilution from the future exercise of the Walgreens warrants. 
I have 4 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance; next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance; the third topic, I will briefly cover are warrant hedging progress to date; and the fourth and final topic, I will wrap up covering our fiscal '15 expectations. So let's begin our Q4 review. The financial results that I provided this  morning will all be on an adjusted basis unless I specifically call them out as being GAAP. Also please note that all financial comparisons are for the fourth quarter ended September 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. For Q4 2015, our revenues increased roughly $4 billion to $35.5 million, up an outstanding 12%. Our growth on a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, was just under 10%. The quarter's gross profit increased $135 million, 15% to about $1.1 billion. Almost all of the dollar growth came from our Other segment primarily as a result of adding MWI. Our pharmaceutical segment was challenged this quarter with a tougher comparison which we anticipated and called out previously. The repricing of the Department of Defense contract and the specialty strong contribution from generic price appreciation back in the September 2015 quarter. Operating expenses, our total OpEx increased about $103 million or 20% to $606 million. Consistent with the change in gross profit dollars that I just covered, the Other segment drove virtually all of the dollar growth, again, due to the addition of MWI. Operating income was $456 million, up $32 million or 80%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down about 5 basis points, driven by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 11 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $27 million. 40% of this expense were all of the inquiries is related to our MWI acquisition financing. Income taxes. Our tax rate was 37% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. I should highlight that our tax expense and associated tax rate are higher this quarter because of a onetime $10 million reserve of a deferred tax asset originating from state net operating losses that we will not likely be able to utilize. This negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.04. Through the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $1.17, driven primarily by the addition of MWI. Our adjusted diluted share count was 230 million shares, essentially flat to last year. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $34 billion, up 9.5%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company had solid revenue growth of 8%, driven by 2 items. The first item we benefited by solid volume growth and to a lesser extent, a strong brand pricing environment. And the second item, we benefited from the final [indiscernible] in the Walgreens business. This key customer accounted for about 60% of the increase in revenue dollars. Beginning in Q1 2016, we anniversary-ed the full ramp of the Walgreens business and we look forward to growing with this customers in the years ahead. Our specialty business group had overall revenue increase of about 24%. Similar to the last 3 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our drug companies to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 15% from higher volumes, a continued good pricing environment and new drug introduction. Specialties growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs. The sales to the Drug Company and specialty are before interest segment elimination, consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in the past. 
Turning to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $794 million, essentially flat. We saw solid gross profit growth in our specialty business due to their higher revenue growth. Our drug company, even with strong revenue growth and a solid contribution from generic billify was still behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 sizable headwinds that I called out previously. Importantly, let me highlight that these 2 headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the segment in our first quarter 2016. So as you think about our quarterly progression, please remember that these will carry over into the first quarter. The segment's gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points, primarily because of these 2 items. 
Operating expenses were slightly over $400 million and were flat year-over-year. Adjusted segment operating income was $388 million and again, essentially flat. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the Drug Company. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, segment revenue growth would have been as a percentage in the low teens. MWI continues to have solid revenue performance as a result of their companion animal business. Excluding the [indiscernible] impact, companion would have had a growth rate us a percentage in the low teens. From an operating income standpoint, we had a significant increase about $30 million to a total operating income of $68 million. The segment benefited mostly from having MWI included in the quarterly results, but our consulting business also made a very good contribution this quarter. MWI did occur a onetime bad debt expense of about $4 million in the quarter related to a U.K. customer that negatively impacted their results. Results that have followed MWI in the past, you know it's highly unusual for the business to have a bad debt at this dollar level. 
Let me switch gears and cover a large GAAP item that occurred in the quarter. We determined that we have a permanent write-down of $31 million in our equity investment in Profarma, a Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler, the right on this due to the significant decline in Profarma stock price from our initial investment due to the date of our permit testing. We concluded that the decline in stock price is other than temporary. Since the stock price declined significantly over 1 year ago and has not recovered since. Let me point out, our investment in the specialty joint venture where we are 50/50 owners with ProFarma continues to ramp and is tracking the forecast. Because of this, there is no impairment of our specialty joint venture asset. 
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few key fiscal 2015 financial metrics. Overall, as Steve mentioned, we did very well meeting or exceeding our increased guidance target. Revenue on a full year basis our group was nearly 14%. Excluding the impact from MWI for approximately 7 months, our revenue growth would have been 12%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented roughly 30% of our total ABT revenues in fiscal '15 and finished slightly ahead our expectation. Our specialty business finished the year $24.4 billion. It was revenue growth of about 24%, both a record. Again, excluding the impact of the oncology drug revenue that shifted, ABSG's revenues on a comparable year-over-year basis was an impressive 15%. 
Our adjusted operating income increased 22% to $1.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.40% an increase of 10 basis points. MWI, our higher-margin business, drove about half of our 10 basis point improvement. EPS, our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.96, up 25%, mostly due to our strong organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefits from a lower consolidated tax rate. Cash flow, we are extremely pleased completing the fiscal year with free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We had a positive impact from higher total generic revenues, up more than 30% full year '15 versus full year '14 and by the onetime ramp of the Walgreens generics business. With better working capital metrics, this significant increase in generic volume [indiscernible] an important driver of our extraordinary cash flow this year. Let me also point out that we did have timing differences which had a positive impact of about $550 million to our free cash flow. Duplicate inventory of $150 million that was a negative in fiscal '14 reversed and helped us in early fiscal '15. We also had about $400 million of timing here recently in September, with 4 business days before Labor Day. We are able to order and receive some brand inventory, sell-through and collect most of the AR by September 30, while the AP wasn't due until October. This called the working capital benefit forward in fiscal '16. 
That's all I have for comments covering our full year 2015. Next, I will recap our warrant hedging progress. As Steve highlighted, we are 100% hedge against the 2016 warrant exercise, meaning we will not have an increased to our adjusted diluted share count. We will warrant this exercise by Walgreens, most likely in March 2016. This quarter, we also made significant progress against the 2017 warrant. We now believe we are 94% covered based on the September 30 ABC share price. This means the uncovered portion, the 6%, translates to about 1.4 million shares shortfall at September 30, 2015. As a reminder, the PharMEDium acquisition will help cover through an income growth any remaining EPS dilution from the anticipated share shortfall once the 2017 warrant is exercised. I'd ask people to refer to the new table we added in our press release that highlights our capped call option coverage and various ABC share prices which you should find helpful. 
Now let's turn to our fiscal '16 expectation. The guidance that I provide includes our plan for PharMEDium acquisition, our working assumption is we will report the business in our fiscal '16 results for about 10 months. Revenues, we expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range. Let me provide some overarching comments of our revenue growth. Approximately 1% of our expected consolidated revenue growth will be due to having MWI from an incremental 5 months from fiscal '15 [ph]. PharMEDium will add less than 1/2 of 1% to our consolidated revenue growth, and as a reminder, this business will become part of ABDC and will be included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. In terms of segments, we expect Pharmaceutical Distribution to grow revenues in the high single digits. Within the segment, our specialty business is expected to grow as a percentage in the low teens. We expect our other segments revenues to grow about 30%, which is aided by having MWI for the full fiscal year. Gross profit, we don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but here are a few key assumptions. Generic price inflation, consistent with what we communicated in the past, we expect to keep the moderation and the dollar contribution amount in fiscal '16 [ph] compared to fiscal '15. Consequently, this represents the headwind for us especially in quarter 1. For drug inflation, we expect to see some moderation in the inflation rates. Generic drug launches, we expect a better year in terms of dollar contributions. Contract renewals, as we have previously stated, ABDC will have a headwind for the first 2 quarters from the Department of Defense renewal and in the last quarter, we will have the impact from the Kaiser contract which we are working hard to renew. 
Next, operating expenses, we expect a fairly high percentage -- growth rate in this area due to adding the incremental 5 months of MWI and to a lesser degree, PharMEDium. About 60% of the consolidated expense increase will be related to these 2 new businesses. a portion of the remaining increase is related to additional IT and DC infrastructure costs related to our large CapEx projects. Examples of the cost include duplicate cost from unparalleled IT systems, additional labor and start-up costs that can't be capitalized. Operating income, we expect operating income dollars to grow between 16% and 18%, driven primarily by ABDC and the addition of PharMEDium. Also, we have the benefit of having MWI for the complete fiscal year. 
Switching to operating margin, we expect our margin and basis points to be up 8 to 12 basis points due primarily to the addition of higher-margin businesses. Interest expense, our interest expense is expected to increase significantly 35% to 40%, due to having a full year of financing related to MWI and the new financing for PharMEDium. Cash rate, our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 35.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Share repurchases, our guidance assumes that our adjusted share count will increase by about 1% in fiscal '15. This is due to curtailing our regular share repurchases until we make progress on our credit metrics, getting them back to target levels. As we make progress against our obligations during the year, we will be thoughtful and always with our capital deployment. Adjusted EPS, we expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.90, an increase of 15% to 19% over our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS of $4.96. This range includes the [indiscernible] of the PharMEDium acquisition that we've highlighted previously. A net contribution of $0.22 to $0.26 for ABC. 
Relative to the 2 large headwinds I called out previously, that DoD contract renewal and moderation in generic price appreciation, it's important again to cover our expected EPS quarterly progression. We expect Q1 to have growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range. By the time we hit to Q4, we expect EPS growth to be in the low 20% range. 
Switching to our cash flow, CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million. Given our cash outlook, we believe this is the right time to invest in our core drug business, and specifically, our distribution center network. We plan to spend about 25% of our CapEx to build one new distribution center and also replace or operate 4 existing DCs. We also expect to spend an incremental $100 million on IT infrastructure projects, including 2 large multiyear projects, a data center consolidation and a new business operating system for our consulting business. 
Free cash flow, we expect to return to a more normalized free cash flow this fiscal year, and as we anniversary the benefit of the significant increase in our generics business, consequently, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. 
In summary, I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to covering several topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention. Like Steve, I'd like to personally thank all the ABC associates for the efforts made this year, delivering these outstanding financial results. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year and we believe the company continues on the right course to deliver long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in ABC.

That's one of the reasons why we entered into this very complicated relationship with them. And so far, that thesis has proved to be very, very intact. And we were irrespective of any consolidation. We were expanding our network. Some of centers have definitely have been around 30 years. I remember when I joined [indiscernible]  1994, Black Houston was the standard in Mansfield. Those are some of the ones that are now older, they were standard most modern DCs in our network. On in a expand the network, but I think it's a good example of investing in our core business and being ready for new developments and new growth. We are with the customers and are growing the fastest, many of them. That is something that is always evident in our thinking when we select who we're going to try to retain and who we're going to go after any competitive key account situation. And then our exposure to specialty is a benefit, not only in growth but also any changes in price increases because specialty drugs, because of ASP in particular, have a lower exposure to price increases historically than other brand drugs and more top brand drugs and established therapies, even the self-administered ones with MS and rheumatoid [indiscernible] typically this position have the lowest exposure to price decreases. So not a good thing about our business so we were very well-prepared. We announced 4 new DCs and one that would be completed this year and we're looking more like [indiscernible] models with these new largest DCs where we have 300 to 400,000 square feet.

It was outside of our usual piers they also some other companies that came in to generic telemarketing and some those even operated by our peer companies so it is a very dynamic marketplace and we focus everyday on aching sure our customers understand it. We should be, I have been really impressed by some of the dashboard tools we have that our service to do on incredible deal, have great access to very powerful and up-to-date tools to show customers exactly what the true net pricing is taking into account full rebate, et cetera. We're doing a great job. I think we'll carry on even better. Again, the last [indiscernible] I think people really understand how we need to compete against [indiscernible] because there's a lot of strong commonality we have and they [indiscernible] based [indiscernible] very helpful. So that is one way that can ask question. Just quickly, because I know we are coming close to -- we actually are [indiscernible] GMP is pretty focused on that. We have announced that we have our strongest level service of offering next-generation services and a lot of that is around here, a lot of it is around new network program, a lot of that is really encouraging at the high level compliance on our customers. So that's all going well. We have over 800 customers sign up and we'll give you further update on that which is have to launch. We are very bullish about what is going."

We also have specialty, so franchise that the a little teams for '16. So we're pretty optimistic about our top line revenue growth. In terms of margin, margins will be flattish, again I called out that you're going to be up 10 basis points in '16 with most of that coming from the new businesses so it has MWI and PharMEDium. So we're really focused on growing on operating dollars. I mean, that's what we do and that's first and foremost and sometimes the margin is challenged because of these large customers and the pricing they get. So it puts a little bit a margin pressure on the P&L. But again, we focus on growing dollars to drive the EPS growth, I do most of it have any comments."

If you set aside the $3.7 billion we added, cash flow fiscal year '15 and go to the more normalized rate we predicted. You will note it has almost doubled our EPS growth rate a little bit less than that. Of course, when you look at it sales. However, we've done a great job of taking that cash flow, managing through the warrant hedging which is being significant and $2 billion of that and then 2 acquisitions with our strong balance sheet that the differentiate us both from services and margins. MWI I think [indiscernible] PharMEDium, if you look at the financial performance, it's been absolutely -- for a large business, one of the most impressive growth rates I have seen since specialty. It's pretty financial performance is what really, really attracted our attention and the ability that we can carry on driving significant numbers. If you look at the job ABC is this doing, we're investing in our core businesses with differentiated complex high margin services and that cash flow is what gives us ability to do it and we've always said our first project is great internal projects. So for example in Heathrow this week $300,000 testing machine I be is going to by which will save us $300,000 a year by the thing we normally talk about, but that's a great example of why investments work for us. Our national center has been an absolute homerun particularly now as we bring it into fiscal year '16. SAP, it cost us a lot more than we expected but we couldn't have gotten the things you that's product number one. Product number two is World Courier PharMEDium and MWI and PharMEDium but MWI and World Courier we feel terrific about the way we have been able to bring people and customers and suppliers. So I think we're doing the job that you are all pay us to do very, very well. I just wouldn't look underestimate the importance of that cash flow and how it's putting into our ability to carry on managing our margin, our growth rate and invest in both internal and external projects. So I did want to make that point as we ramped up. 
So thanks, Eric, and I'll just conclude by saying how proud we are of our performance this year. It really has been a great couple of years. We're excited about developments in the marketplace. No one can accuse us sector being boring at all. This is an incredibly dynamic time to be in the industry. I'm just really proud of the way ABC is positioned the way we approach the customers, the way we approach associates, actually the relationship we have with our board I should say is another great element of our success. So, hopefully, that this call will demonstrate both the value we're providing as well as the confidence we have in the future. Thanks for your time today."

We've actually changed locations within our headquarters here, so the train should not be very prominent today. And I'm sure you would appreciate that. 
I am just tremendously proud of the results that we are presenting today, and I commend our highly engaged associates for the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved this year. Our success is being driven by the approach we take in the marketplace. We constantly seek to examine our industry with fresh eyes. We've only taken the steps that are necessary to avail ourselves of the opportunities that we see unfolding, and we work collaboratively and creatively to address challenges we see in front of us and our partners in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed, our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing innovative solutions for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers. Our results are a testament of precision and proficiency with which we run our business and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders.
In financial terms, we exceeded all of our expectations for fiscal year 2015. Our revenues for the full year were up 14% to $136 billion, and adjusted earnings per share from continued operations -- from continuing operations were up 25% to $4.96. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong this year, coming in at a record $3.7 billion. The strength of our financial position enable us to make important strategic investments, including the acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and, most recently, the pending acquisition of PharMEDium. The addition of these 2 high-quality assets to the AmerisourceBergen portfolio demonstrates our commitment to the pharmaceutical supply channel and the opportunities we see inherent in it. It also highlights our ability to extend our existing capability into new markets and to continuously enhance the services we are able to provide to our existing customers. 
We could not have made these 2 significant investments in the same calendar year if we did not have tremendous confidence in our ability to manage complex, diverse businesses that enhance the level of range and services that we provide to the market. Moreover, in addition to making these investments, we have also made substantial progress in offsetting the expected impact of warrant exercises we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. At this stage, we have essentially completely offset the impact of the warrants, and I'm very proud that we have so adroitly been able to perform a commitment which we made to our shareholders when we first entered into the long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
This relationship, which will be coming up to our 3-year anniversary, has, thus far, been a tremendous success, and we look forward to many more benefits in the years ahead. We selected WBA as our long-term partner not only for cultural fit, but also because we believe they were the best long-term partner for us in the retail chain space. And certainly, their performance as our largest customer and sourcing partner has been a very significant contributor to our performance over the last few years. 
Our operational execution was also very strong this year. All our customers have benefited from enhancements we have made to our infrastructure, and we have certainly been realizing the benefits of the increasing scale of our business, where we have more than doubled the number of lives we manage over the last 25 months. We have also continued to execute on our advanced programs and services for our manufacturer customers, including those provided by AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. 
While we have substantially strengthened our core business over the last few years, we always feel like we can and should do better. 
Our customers are being challenged, and they want and should expect that we will step up in new and innovative ways as well. But this is what excites and motivates our team. We also continue to work on the associate experience part of our business, and I feel we are not only attracting and, importantly, retaining exceptional talent, but we are being recognized for our culture in the marketplace. Just this week, we were named one of the coolest places to work in Philadelphia by Philadelphia magazine. Not that you can put this in our EPS guidance, but it's still a recognition that we are proud of. 
For many, many years, wholesalers have proven to be one of the most resilient and reliable components of the pharmaceutical channel. Over the last 2 years, our entire industry has successfully transformed itself in order to better address the changing and consolidating needs of the health care landscape. Wholesalers have proven to be adept at providing value that goes well beyond the essential services of aggregating demand and the logistics of getting products from one point to another safely and securely. We help enable efficient pharmaceutical care and the widest possible access to products, which allows our customers to focus on expertly caring for their patients. 
It remains an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are solid. Health reform initiatives continue to improve access to care, and new and innovative products are coming to market. In recent years, we have seen new products come to market that dramatically improved the lives of patients and, often, in cost effective ways. The R&D pipeline remains full of promising new products, and the combination of advanced therapies and improving access to care not only drives growth opportunities but, most importantly, meaningfully increase patient lives. 
The higher percentage of generic scripts in the market is what helps [ph] pharmaceutical care be an even greater driver of efficient health care for the many of the therapies that we deliver. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapy across all sites of care. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. Tim will provide the financial details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter, with revenues up 8% even as we continue to fully anniversary the onboarding of the Walgreens business. Our growth was driven in large part by solid organic volume growth. While generic drug inflation has slowed meaningfully over the course of the year, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chain. Health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. 
Last quarter, I spoke about enhancements we have made to our programs for our independent pharmacy customers. The opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists that impact the delivery of health care in the U.S. will be an important contributor to our growth going forward. For many years, we have been proud advocates for community pharmacies that increasingly provide some of the most important touch points to ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care.  
We also remain very active with regulators and legislators, both independently and through our trade associations, to expertly advise and inform those important constituents on present issues for our industry and our customers, especially with respect to issues regarding the safety and security of the pharmaceutical supply channel. Through the close of the September quarter, we have now fully anniversary-ed the onboarding of the Walgreens distribution business. Since the implementation of this historic distribution contract, Walgreens has exceeded our internal growth estimates as a customer this quarter, this year and last year. 
As our retail business has grown substantially over the last 2 fiscal years, we've also had strong performance in our health systems and alternate site segments. In early October, we were very pleased to announce the definitive agreement to acquire PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. This acquisition represents an important investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to our health system customers, a customer segment that is playing increasingly important role in the provision of health care in the U.S. PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality CSPs in key therapeutic orders -- areas, combined with their impressive track record of growth, made them a compelling addition to ABDC. Because expect PharMEDium to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and we expect the transaction to close during the first quarter, we have included the anticipated contribution from PharMEDium in the guidance we are giving for fiscal 2016 today. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturer-imposed changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenue from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up an impressive 15%. Our physician distribution businesses, ASD and our community oncology business, all performed very well in the quarter. We continue to be very confident and proud of our specialty franchise. 
Our market share -- our market leadership in this area is rooted in customer intimacy and deep experience. This important knowledge has been the inspiration for the investments we have made in this business and the portfolio of service we have developed over many years. Our capability to extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. I believe the true differentiator of our specialty business is our collaborative approach to bringing innovative solutions to both our physician and manufacturer customers. 
Working in concert with our business partners is the best way to both discover and deliver value in the long run, especially in a marketplace that is increasingly focused on the cost of care. During the year, our GSMR, global supply manufacturer relations, business unit, based principally out of Bern, Switzerland, also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, has made important inroads on the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of professionalism and coordination between suppliers and our customers. This also includes an almost 24/7 communication rhythm with our partners at WBAD.
Let's turn now to the other segments. We had a full quarter of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on their integration. We have met with most of the large animal health manufacturers and made good progress on the identification of synergies. One area where we see a lot of opportunity is in sharing and enhancing technology, not just in our warehouses and distribution centers but also in the systems and proven methodologies with which we interact with customers and suppliers. We have made a few tuck-in acquisitions in this area, specifically over the last several months, and while they are small relative to the size of our total business, they are very important to the future of the animal health platform. 
The companion animal business was especially strong in the September quarter with growth in the low teens. I have to say that with just 7 completed months on our belt, we are delighted by how the MWI integration into ABC has gone. Moreover, we feel very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016, and we'll make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we add this complex new segment to our business. MWI's willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their ongoing commitment to outstanding execution and customer service gives us great confidence in the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. 
Our manufacturer services business also had a solid September quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence program and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacturer services and clinical trial logistic businesses further expand our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products, launched in most of the developed world. 
As I've said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segment. Better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics drive organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutic market. Advances in veterinary medicine improve the quality of life of companion animals and give pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, increasing global demand for protein drive the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has got in the U.S. and to developing global markets. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, and as I mentioned last quarter, there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we ask you to bear in mind as you think about our growth rates for next year. Tim will cover the specifics of our expectations, but I want to highlight a few areas. First, the tailwinds: continued solid organic revenue growth, driven primarily by customer and product mix; better generic launch outlooks; and 5 months incremental benefit from MWI. The headwinds are: significant impact from DoD contract repricing in the first half of this current -- of this recently past fiscal year; other customer contract renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016, notably Kaiser, whose contract expires late in the fiscal year, and as we have shared before, that contract will be about 7 years from when we first entered into this generation of a contract; third, declining dollar contribution from generic inflation; no onetime benefits from some of the cash flow drivers we experienced in fiscal year 2015. 
There are a few additional assumptions to contemplate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution from warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. $0.22 to $0.26 of net contribution from PharMEDium and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain confident that biosimilars are an exciting opportunity for ABC and the market. As discussed before, we believe we would have a particularly strong role, especially in the physician-administered biosimilar products. The challenges remain on the legal and regulatory side, which prevent us from being too bullish on what biosimilars could contribute to ABC in the short to medium term. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to take a moment to thank our associates for delivering excellent performance in fiscal 2015. Our value creation is the result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas, and our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is focused. They share my conviction that doing things efficiently and being part -- and being expanding and dynamic channel partner with a view to the future will be what sets ABC apart. The always-improving quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our thoughtful capital management will help us grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for our manufacturer and health care provider customers, our shareholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. 
Now here is Tim."

As Steve mentioned, we completed another excellent year in ABC. Let me spend a minute and quickly recap a few highlights. 
Our drug company executed extremely well this year. They finished the fiscal year setting internal records for both product service levels and order accuracy for all those customers. Our Specialty Group continues to grow and execute as well. They had their best revenue growth year in the last 8 years, with all the businesses in the portfolio contributing. We added MWI and are in process of closing PharMEDium. Both are respected leaders with high market shares, and both have excellent long-term business prospects. Finally, we exit the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet while virtually eliminating the expected impact of the dilution from the future exercise of the Walgreens warrants.

For Q4 2015, our revenues increased roughly $4 billion to $35.5 billion, up an outstanding 12%. Our growth on a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, was just under 10%. The quarter's gross profit increased $135 million, 15%, to about $1.1 billion. Almost all of the dollar growth came from our Other segment, primarily as a result of adding MWI. Our pharmaceutical segment was challenged this quarter with a tough comparison, which we anticipated and called out previously, the repricing of the Department of Defense contract and the especially strong contribution from generic price appreciation back in the September 2014 quarter. 
Operating expenses. Our total OpEx increased about $103 million or 20% to $606 million, consistent with the change in gross profit dollars that I just covered. The Other segment drove virtually all of the dollar growth, again, due to the addition of MWI. Operating income was $456 million, up $32 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down about 5 basis points, driven by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 11 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net was about $27 million. 40% of this expense or all of the increase is related to our MWI acquisition financing. 
Income taxes. Our tax rate was 37% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. I should highlight that our tax expense and associated tax rate are higher this quarter because of a onetime $10 million reserve of a deferred tax asset originating from state net operating losses that we will not likely be able to utilize. This negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.04. 
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $1.17, driven primarily by the addition of MWI. Our adjusted diluted share count was 230 million shares, essentially flat to last year. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $34 billion, up 9.5%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company had solid revenue growth of 8%, driven by 2 items. The first item, we benefited from solid volume growth and, to a lesser extent, a strong brand pricing environment. And the second item, we benefited from the final ramp of the Walgreens business. This key customer accounted for about 60% of the increase in revenue dollars. Beginning in Q1 2016, we anniversary the full ramp of the Walgreens business, and we look forward to growing with this customer in the years ahead. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 24%. Similar to the last 3 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our drug company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 15% from higher volumes, a continued good pricing environment and new drug introduction. Specialty's growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs. The sales percentages of the drug company and specialty are before intra-segment elimination, consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in the past. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, essentially flat. We saw solid gross profit growth in our specialty business due to their higher revenue growth. Our drug company, even with strong revenue growth and a solid contribution from generic Abilify, was still behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 sizable headwinds that I called out previously. Importantly, let me highlight that these 2 headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the segment in our first quarter 2016. So as you think about our quarterly progression, please remember that these will carry over into the first quarter. The segment's gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points, primarily because of these 2 items. 
Operating expenses were slightly over $400 million and were flat year-over-year. Adjusted segment operating income was $388 million and, again, essentially flat. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the drug company. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, segment revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the low teens. MWI continues to have solid revenue performance as a result of their companion animal business. Excluding the IDEXX impact, companion would have had a growth rate, as a percentage, in the low teens. 
From an operating income standpoint, we had a significant increase, about $30 million, to a total operating income of $68 million. The segment benefited mostly from having MWI included in the quarterly results, but our consulting business also made a very good contribution this quarter. MWI did incur a onetime bad debt expense of about $4 million in the quarter related to a U.K. customer that negatively impacted their results. For those that have followed MWI in the past, you know it's highly unusual for the business to have a bad debt at this dollar level. 
Let me switch gears and cover a large GAAP item that occurred in the quarter. We determined that we have a permanent write-down of $31 million in our equity investment in Profarma, a Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler. The write-down is due to the significant decline in Profarma stock price from our initial investment date to the date of our impairment testing. We concluded that the decline in stock price is other than temporary since the stock price declined significantly over 1 year ago and has not recovered since. Let me point out, our investment in the specialty joint venture, where we are 50/50 owners with Profarma, continues to ramp and is tracking to forecast. Because of this, there is no impairment of our specialty joint venture asset. 
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few key fiscal 2015 financial metrics. Overall, as Steve mentioned, we did very well meeting or exceeding our increased guidance targets. Revenue on a full year basis, our growth was nearly 14%. Excluding the impact from MWI for approximately 7 months, our revenue growth would have been 12%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented roughly 30% of our total ABC revenues in fiscal '15 and finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our specialty business finished the year at $24.4 billion. It was revenue growth of about 24%, both a record. Again, excluding the impact of the oncology drug revenue that shifted, ABSG's revenues on a comparable year-over-year basis was an impressive 15%. 
Our adjusted operating income increased 22% to $1.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.40%, an increase of 10 basis points. MWI, a higher-margin business, drove about half of our 10 basis point improvement. EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.96, up 25%, mostly due to our strong organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefits from a lower consolidated tax rate. 
Cash flow, we are extremely pleased completing the fiscal year with free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We had a positive impact from higher total generic revenues, up more than 30% full year '15 versus full year '14, aided by the onetime ramp of Walgreens generics business. With better working capital metrics, this significant increase in generic volume was an important driver of our extraordinary cash flow this year. Let me also point out that we did have timing differences, which had a positive impact of about $550 million to our free cash flow. 
Duplicate inventory of $150 million, that was a negative in fiscal '14, reversed and helped us in early fiscal '15. We also had about $400 million of timing here recently in September. With 4 business days before Labor Day, we are able to order and receive some brand inventory, sell through and collect most of the AR by September 30 while the AP wasn't due until October. This pulls a working capital benefit forward from fiscal '16. 
That's all I have for comments covering our full year 2015. Next, I will recap our warrant hedging progress. As Steve highlighted, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise, meaning we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreens, most likely in March 2016. This quarter, we also made significant progress against the 2017 warrant. We now believe we are 94% covered based on the September 30 ABC share price. This means the uncovered portion, the 6%, translates to about 1.4 million share shortfall at September 30, 2015. 
As a reminder, the PharMEDium acquisition will help cover, through income growth, any remaining EPS dilution from the anticipated share shortfall once the 2017 warrant is exercised. I'd ask people to refer to the new table we added in our press release that highlights our cash call option coverage at various ABC share prices, which you should find helpful. 
Now let's turn to our fiscal '16 expectations. The guidance that I provide will include our planned PharMEDium acquisition. Our working assumption is that we will report the business in our fiscal '16 results for about 10 months. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range. Let me provide some overarching comments about revenue growth. Approximately 1% of our expected consolidated revenue growth will be due to having MWI for an incremental 5 months in fiscal '16. PharMEDium will add less than 0.5% to our consolidated revenue growth, and as a reminder, this business will become part of ABDC and will be included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
In terms of segments, we expect Pharmaceutical Distribution to grow revenues in the high single digits. Within the segment, our specialty business is expected to grow, as a percentage, in the low teens. We expect our Other segment's revenues to grow about 30%, which is aided by having MWI for the full fiscal year. 
Gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but here are a few key assumptions. Generic price inflation, consistent with what we communicated in the past, we expect to achieve some moderation in the dollar contribution amount in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Consequently, this represents a headwind for us, especially in quarter 1. Brand drug inflation, we expect to see some moderation in the inflation rates. Generic drug launches, we expect a better year in terms of dollar contribution. Contract renewals. As we have previously stated, ABDC will have a headwind for the first 2 quarters from the Department of Defense renewal, and in the last quarter, we will have the impact from the Kaiser contract, which we are working hard to renew. 
Next, operating expenses. We expect a fairly high percentage of -- fairly high percentage growth rate in this area due to adding the incremental 5 months of MWI and, to a lesser degree, PharMEDium. About 60% of the consolidated expense increase will be related to these 2 new businesses. A portion of the remaining increase is related to additional IT and DC infrastructure costs related to our large CapEx projects. Examples of the costs include duplicate costs to run parallel IT systems, additional labor and start-up costs that can't be capitalized. 
Operating income. We expect operating income dollars to grow between 16% and 18%, driven primarily by ABDC and the addition of PharMEDium. Also, we have the benefit of having MWI for the complete fiscal year.  Switching to operating margin. We expect our margin in basis points to be up 8 to 12 basis points due primarily to the addition of higher-margin businesses. 
Interest expense. Our interest expense is expected to increase significantly, 35% to 40%, due to having a full year of financing relating to MWI and the new financing for PharMEDium. Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 35.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes that our adjusted share count will increase by about 1% in fiscal '16. This is due to curtailing our regular share repurchases until we make progress on our credit metrics, getting them back to target levels. As we make progress against our obligations during the year, we will be thoughtful, as always, with our capital deployment. 
Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.90, an increase of 15% to 19% over our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS of $4.96. This range includes the benefit of the PharMEDium acquisition that we've highlighted previously, a net contribution of $0.22 to $0.26 for ABC. Relative to the 2 large headwinds I've called out previously, that DoD contract renewal and moderation in generic price appreciation, it's important, again, to cover our expected EPS quarterly progression. We expect Q1 to have growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. By the time we head to Q4, we expect EPS growth to be in the low 20% range. 
Switching to our cash flow. CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million. Given our cash outlook, we believe this is the right time to invest in our core drug business and, specifically, our distribution center network. We plan to spend about 25% of our CapEx to build one new distribution center and also replace or upgrade 4 existing DCs. We also expect to spend an incremental $100 million on IT infrastructure projects, including 2 large multiyear projects, a data center consolidation and a new business operating system for our consulting business. 
Free cash flow. We expect to return to a more normalized free cash flow this fiscal year. And as we anniversary the benefit of the significant increase in our generics business, consequently, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. 
In summary, I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to covering several topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention. Like Steve, I'd like to personally thank all the ABC associates for the efforts made this year, delivering these outstanding financial results. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, and we believe the company continues on the right course to deliver long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in ABC.

I mean, these are actually some of the things that MWI appreciate about joining ABC, is a lot of the development programs we have. And yes, I think the culture is something that truly is setting us more and more apart with enthusiasm and passion people have for the business. For example, I was in our World Courier office in London on Monday, I'd tell you, it's very infectious, the passion that group has. Essentially, it's the same people there when we acquired the company, and that was the last time I was there, was actually just a little bit after we completed the acquisition. But the same is true wherever we go. I was in Ireland with our BluePoint folks Friday. So just -- but more importantly, from a scale perspective, the U.S. business is also very true of that, whether it's [indiscernible] the specialty group in Charlotte, the Consulting Services in Philadelphia and all that drug company regions. So just pointing out that our culture is really a strong driver of our performance, and the confidence that Tim and I have that we can pull off 2 maybe conflicting [ph] deals like this, we -- $5 billion in acquisition in 1 year is definitely a sign that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute."

And now that's turned out to be what we think is probably one of the key drivers for our investment decision guide, the quality requirements that are going to come that are already resident in that business, and we think that will only improve, increase the vigilance that will be required from the pharmacies. And the scale is only going to increase. And we were just so impressed with the company, the differentiation and the commitment to quality. The acquisition idea has been very well received by health systems customers. We had some -- one of our big customers said, ""Did you guys take your balls off?"" That was one of the comments they gave us back. But we had a quick diligence here. It's not of the overall footprint of, say, even a smaller acquisition at World Courier, with 4 very large compounding pharmacies, in which we manage to visit all of them during our diligence. But we're excited. And we think that there will be a very interesting dialogue, both with the FDA and other regulators, but we expect that we will continue to set the bar for quality in this area. And we think that the service will be -- it's not a commodity service at all. This is a high-quality service that is complex, and like I said when we announced it, if my family was being -- was getting a sterile IV, I'd like it to come from PharMEDium. I can't believe that a hospital on its own can create the center of excellence that a company like PharMEDium can fully be sterile preparation. So we're expecting to close some time in the next 2 to 3 weeks because we were having some bad news from SEC. But we're well positioned to close, and we're excited to bring them onboard. And we do expect that we will close fairly shortly because Tim wouldn't include it in guidance if we haven't had that strong expectation. So Tim, anything else to add?"

It's really early because, obviously, we would anticipate -- we anticipated that WBA would be a consolidator. That's one of the reasons why we entered into this very comprehensive relationship with them. And so far, that thesis has proved to be very, very intact, and. We were -- irrespective of any consolidation, we were expanding our network. Some of our centers definitely have been around 30 years. I remember when I joined Bergen, for example, in 1994, that Houston was the standard and Mansfield. Those are some of the ones that are now older. They were the standard, most modern DCs in our network. So it's definitely time that -- we needed to expand the network. But I think it's a good example of us investing in our core business and being ready for new developments and new growth. We are with the customers that are growing the fastest, many of them. That is something that is always evident in our thinking when we select who we're going to try to retain and who we're going to go after in a competitive or a key account [ph] situation. So -- and then our exposure to specialty is a benefit to us, not only in growth but also in any changes in price increases. Because specialty drugs, because of ASD in particular, have a lower exposure to price increases historically than other brand drugs and more -- or the top brand drugs and established therapies, even the self-administered ones with MS and rheumatoid arthritis, for example. Typically, those physician-administered have the lowest exposure to price increases. So not a good thing about our business, so we were very well prepared. We've announced 4 new DCs and one that will be completed this year, and we're looking more like the Orlando models with these new large DCs, where we have 300,000 to 400,000 square feet. So it's really impressive, and we use the same footprint. It's very efficient. We've retained a lot of the people that worked on the AmerisourceBergen integration, and we've retained very good engineering and distribution, science department that continues to perform excellently for us. And we use them to consult with customers on different project as well, so they're a great resource for us. It's probably something we don't talk about enough. So many things..."

So we continue to have great discussions about bucket 3. I'd tell you bucket 2, which is the sourcing, has been terrific. We still think we're the most global. We have overall still the largest sourcing, contracting ability. And I think you've seen Stefano's really strong inclination to growth, both organically and through acquisition, and Alex having a strong focus on the customer experience in the stores.

And then this seems to be a bit of a moving target, where inflation has been and where it's going. I guess, how much visibility do you guys have or do you feel you have around this important driver?"

If we take in that 2 quarter and -- period, so that's probably the run rate. So that's how we're thinking about '16, positive contribution to GP. In terms of inflation/deflation, we have a large portfolio of generics. I mean that basket can still be somewhat deflationary and still provide positive contribution to your P&L. We really haven't commented on where we think that portfolio would be. But again, I would assume, as we've been in the past, slightly positive with that portfolio, it's going to be slightly negative in '16."

It's some of the bigger products as well, which was -- has been well recorded. And I don't expect that -- we'd probably see more resumption to the low teens or even high single digits. That's the range that we would see. Again, ABC, our portfolio is very geared towards specialty, which, as I've said a little while ago, because of ASD, on the physician side, you don't see the big increases there that you see in other sectors. So we think that pharmaceuticals still, of course, provide excellent health care efficiency. And especially when they're administered in the correct settings with the right sort of adherence programs, that's the best driver of -- one of the best drivers of value. So we -- and I think manufacturers -- I think you just have a lot of therapies that provide excellent value. And then I look at new therapies being introduced and the efficacy of those drugs, and I think there's been a propensity to increase that. But we -- I think the change generally gets overestimated and things take a lot longer than you expect. And a good example I can give you is the pedigree rule. Everyone knew that it had to be made -- it had to be passed, it made sense but it was going to cause a lot of inefficiency in the system. So the states started passing their own pedigree rule, but it's very, very hard to get legislation passed, as you know. Although we had this week of events [ph], but notwithstanding that, it is -- it always does seem to get very hard -- very hard to get legislation passed. And I would just remember that when you're make any assumption on how things will change especially from legislation."

Something that's not in our control is generic price appreciation. It's -- again, that is an enhancer sure, but those other categories are really significant to our P&L."

So I can answer that a few ways, Lisa. Thanks for the question. The best way and the most practical way for an ABC customer to exit the WBAD benefit is through our ProGen formulary, and we are focused every day on making that the best overall value benefit. And so it doesn't -- it's not really the headline news, but it's one of the -- we do this monthly business reviews and the first -- I think on Page 8 or 9, we start getting to ProGen volume. And when I get the data, I know it's the first thing I look at, how we're doing in ProGen because it's so important to us and it's a key driver. And ABC, I think, with the SAP implementation and with Bob Mauch coming on as President and his strong analytical background, I know that it gets stronger and stronger all the time. And it's very complex because there's 2,000 important generic products, and a lot of our customers are in the market. And it was -- outside of our usual peers, there's also some other companies that get into generic telemarketing, and some of those are even operated by our peer companies. So it's a very dynamic marketplace, and we focus every day on making sure our customers understand it. Recently, I've been really impressed with some of the dashboard tools we have so that our sales reps can do incredible deals, have great access to very powerful and up-to-date tools to show customers exactly what the true net pricing is, taking into account full rebate, et cetera. So we're doing a great job. I think we'll carry on getting even better. Again, the Alliance Boots heritage, I think people really understand how we need to compete against [indiscernible] wholesalers, et cetera. So there's a lot of strong commonality we have. And then Peyton's group being based in Bern, I think, is also very helpful. So that must be one way to answer your question [ph]. Just quickly, I know because we're coming close to -- we actually are over our time. GNP, with David who's being fully focused on that, we've announced that we had our strongest new level of service offering. We called it the next generation of services, and a lot of that is around adherence. A lot of it is around new network program. A lot of that is really encouraging the highest level of compliance from our customers. So that's all going well. We have over 800 customers sign up the first month to go on the Elevate platform, and we'll give you further updates on that. We just had a lot to talk about on this call, but we're very bullish about where it's going."

That's why -- we do have inflation baked in there. We do sell a large mix of brand drugs. But at the end of the day, large customers, like a Walgreens and like a Kaiser and others, the GPOs, grow faster, and that helps us. and let's not forget we also have specialty, a strong franchise that we called out should grow in the low teens for '16. So we're pretty optimistic about our top line revenue growth. In terms of margin, margins will be flattish. Again, I called out that we're going to be up 10 basis points in '16, with most of that coming from the new businesses. So that's MWI and PharMEDium. We're really focused on growing on operating dollars. I mean, that's what we do, and that's first and foremost. And then sometimes, the margin is challenged because of these large customers and the pricing they get, so it puts a little bit of margin pressure on the P&L.

I think one thing we try to do, if you just -- I would love to make this comment because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of.

I think one thing we try to do, if you just -- I would love to make this comment because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of. If you look at -- set aside the $3.7 billion we had in cash flow in fiscal year '15 and go to the more normalized rate we predicted, but you'll note that it's almost double our EPS growth rate, a little bit less than that. Of course, when you look at it, it's only takes about 6 days [ph] sales. However, we've done a great job of taking that cash flow and managing through the warrant hedging, which has been significant. We have over $2 billion of that. And then 2 acquisitions with our strong balance sheet that will differentiate us both in services and margins. MWI, I think was what I [indiscernible]. But PharMEDium, if you look at their financial performance, it's been absolutely, for a large business, one of the most impressive growth rates I've seen since our early days of specialty. It's pretty -- their financial performance is what really, really attracted our attention and our ability that we can carry on driving significant numbers. So if you look at the job ABC is doing, we're investing in our core businesses with differentiated, complex, higher-margin services, and that cash flow is what gives us ability to do it. And we've always said our first pride is great internal projects. So for example, when I was in Heathrow this week, the $300,000 testing machine that they're going to buy, which will save us $300,000 a year in testing expenses, not anything we'd normally talk about, but that's a great example of why internal investments work the best for us. Our national distribution [ph] center has been an absolute home run, particularly now as we bring it into fiscal year '16. SAP, it cost us a lot more than we expected, but we couldn't have done the things we've done without it. So that's pride #1. Pride #2 is World Courier, PharMEDium and MWI. And PharMEDium, I spoke to earlier before. But MWI, I think, and World Courier, we feel terrific about the way we've been able to bring in the people, the customers and the suppliers. So I think we're doing the job that you're all paying us to do very, very well. And I just wouldn't, look, underestimate the importance of that cash flow and how it's putting into our ability to carry on managing our margins, our growth rates and invest both in internal and external projects. So I just -- I did want to make that point as we wrapped up. 
So thanks, Eric. And I'll just conclude by saying how proud we are of our performance this year. It really has been a great couple of years. We're excited about developments in the marketplace. No one can accuse our sector of being boring at all, And this is an incredibly dynamic time to be in this industry. And I'm just really proud of the way ABC is positioned, the way we're approaching customers, the way we're approaching associates. And actually, the relationship I have with our board, I should say, is another great element of our success. 
So hopefully, that this call will demonstrate both the value we're providing as well as the confidence we have in the future. Thanks for your time today. Barb, you're going to close?"

We've actually changed locations within our headquarters here, so the train should not be very prominent today. And I'm sure you all appreciate that. 
I am just tremendously proud of the results that we are presenting today, and I commend our highly engaged associates for the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved this year. Our success is being driven by the approach we take to marketplace. We constantly seek to examine our industry with fresh eyes. We always take the steps that are necessary to avail ourselves of the opportunities that we see unfolding, and we work collaboratively and creatively to address challenges we see in front of us and our partners in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed, our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing innovative solutions for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers. Our results are a testament to precision and proficiency with which we run our business and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders.
In financial terms, we exceeded all of our expectations for fiscal year 2015. Our revenues for the full year were up 14% to $136 billion, and adjusted earnings per share from continued operations -- from continuing operations were up 25% to $4.96. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong this year, coming in at a record $3.7 billion. The strength of our financial position enable us to make important strategic investments, including the acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and, most recently, the pending acquisition of PharMEDium. The addition of these 2 high-quality assets to the AmerisourceBergen portfolio demonstrates our commitment to the pharmaceutical supply channel and the opportunities we see inherent in it. It also highlights our ability to extend our existing capability into new markets and to continuously enhance the services we are able to provide to our existing customers. 
We could not have made these 2 significant investments in the same calendar year if we did not have tremendous confidence in our ability to manage complex, diverse businesses that enhance the level of range and services that we provide to the market. Moreover, in addition to making these investments, we have also made substantial progress in offsetting the expected impact of warrant exercises we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. At this stage, we have essentially completely offset the impact of the warrants, and I'm very proud that we have so adroitly been able to perform a commitment which we made to our shareholders when we first entered into the long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
This relationship, which will be coming up to our 3-year anniversary, has, thus far, been a tremendous success, and we look forward to many more benefits in the years ahead. We selected WBA as our long-term partner not only for cultural fit, but also because we believe they were the best long-term partner for us in the retail chain space. And certainly, their performance as our largest customer and sourcing partner has been a very significant contributor to our performance over the last few years. 
Our operational execution was also very strong this year. All our customers have benefited from enhancements we have made to our infrastructure, and we have certainly been realizing the benefits of the increasing scale of our business, where we have more than doubled the number of lines we manage over the last 25 months. We have also continued to execute on our advanced programs and services for our manufacturer customers, including those provided by AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. 
While we have substantially strengthened our core business over the last few years, we always feel like we can and should do better. 
Our customers are being challenged, and they want and should expect that we will step up in new and innovative ways as well. But this is what excites and motivates our team. We also continue to work on the associate experience part of our business, and I feel we are not only attracting and, importantly, retaining exceptional talent, but we are being recognized for our culture in the marketplace. Just this week, we were named one of the coolest places to work in Philadelphia by Philadelphia magazine. Not that you can put this in our EPS guidance, but it's still a recognition that we are proud of. 
For many, many years, wholesalers have proven to be one of the most resilient and reliable components of the pharmaceutical channel. Over the last 2 years, our entire industry has successfully transformed itself in order to better address the changing and consolidating needs of the health care landscape. Wholesalers have proven to be adept at providing value that goes well beyond the essential services of aggregating demand and the logistics of getting products from one point to another safely and securely. We help enable efficient pharmaceutical care and the widest possible access to products, which allows our customers to focus on expertly caring for their patients. 
It remains an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are solid. Health reform initiatives continue to improve access to care, and new and innovative products are coming to market. In recent years, we have seen new products come to market that dramatically improved the lives of patients and, often, in cost effective ways. The R&D pipeline remains full of promising new products, and the combination of advanced therapies and improving access to care not only drives growth opportunities but, most importantly, meaningfully increase patient lives. 
The high percentage of generic scripts in the market is what helps [ph] pharmaceutical care be an even greater driver of efficient health care for the many of the therapies that we deliver. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapy across all sites of care. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. Tim will provide the financial details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter, with revenues up 8% even as we continue to fully anniversary the onboarding of the Walgreens business. Our growth was driven in large part by solid organic volume growth. While generic drug inflation has slowed meaningfully over the course of the year, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chain, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. 
Last quarter, I spoke about enhancements we have made to our programs for our independent pharmacy customers. The opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists to impact the delivery of health care in the U.S. will be an important contributor to our growth going forward. For many years, we have been proud advocates for community pharmacies that increasingly provide some of the most important touch points to ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care.  
We also remain very active with regulators and legislators, both independently and through our trade associations, to expertly advise and inform those important constituents on pertinent issues for our industry and our customers, especially with respect to issues regarding the safety and security of the pharmaceutical supply channel. With the close of the September quarter, we have now fully anniversary-ed the onboarding of the Walgreens distribution business. Since the implementation of this historic distribution contract, Walgreens has exceeded our internal growth estimates as a customer this quarter, this year and last year. 
As our retail business has grown substantially over the last 2 fiscal years, we've also had strong performance in our health systems and alternate site segments. In early October, we were very pleased to announce the definitive agreement to acquire PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. This acquisition represents an important investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to our health system customers, a customer segment that is playing increasingly important role in the provision of health care in the U.S. PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality CSPs in key therapeutic orders -- areas, combined with their impressive track record of growth, made them a compelling addition to ABDC. Because we expect PharMEDium to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and we expect the transaction to close during the first quarter, we have included the anticipated contribution from PharMEDium in the guidance we are giving for fiscal 2016 today. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturer-imposed changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenue from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up an impressive 15%. Our physician distribution businesses, ASD and our community oncology business, all performed very well in the quarter. We continue to be very confident and proud of our specialty franchise. 
Our market share -- our market leadership in this area is rooted in customer intimacy and deep experience. This important knowledge has been the inspiration for the investments we have made in this business and the portfolio of service we have developed over many years. Our capability to extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. I believe the true differentiator of our specialty business is our collaborative approach to bringing innovative solutions to both our physician and manufacturer customers. 
Working in concert with our business partners is the best way to both discover and deliver value in the long run, especially in a marketplace that is increasingly focused on the cost of care. During the year, our GSMR, global supply manufacturer relations business unit, based principally out of Bern, Switzerland, also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, has made important inroads on the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of professionalism and coordination between suppliers and our customers. This also includes an almost 24/7 communication rhythm with our partners at WBAD.
Let's turn now to the other segments. We had a full quarter of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on their integration. We have met with most of the large animal health manufacturers and made good progress on the identification of synergies. One area where we see a lot of opportunity is in sharing and enhancing technology, not just in our warehouses and distribution centers but also in the systems and proven methodologies with which we interact with customers and suppliers. We have made a few tuck-in acquisitions in this area, specifically over the last several months, and while they are small relative to the size of our total business, they are very important to the future of the animal health platform. 
The companion animal business was especially strong in the September quarter with growth in the low teens. I have to say that with just 7 completed months on our belt, we are delighted by how the MWI integration into ABC has gone. Moreover, we feel very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016, and we'll make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we add this complex new segment to our business. MWI's willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their ongoing commitment to outstanding execution and customer service gives us great confidence in the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. 
Our manufacturer services business also had a solid September quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence program and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacturer services and clinical trial logistic businesses further expand our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products, launched in most of the developed world. 
As I've said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segment. Better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics drive organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Advances in veterinary medicine improve the quality of life of companion animals and give pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, increasing global demand for protein drive the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has got in the U.S. and to developing global markets. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, and as I mentioned last quarter, there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we ask you to bear in mind as you think about our growth rates for next year. Tim will cover the specifics of our expectations, but I want to highlight a few areas. First, the tailwinds: continued solid organic revenue growth, driven primarily by customer and product mix; better generic launch outlooks; and 5 months incremental benefit from MWI. The headwinds are: significant impact from DoD contract repricing in the first half of this current -- of this recently past fiscal year; other customer contract renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016, notably Kaiser, whose contract expires late in the fiscal year, and as we have shared before, that contract will be about 7 years from when we first entered into this generation of a contract; third, declining dollar contribution from generic inflation; no onetime benefits from some of the cash flow drivers we experienced in fiscal year 2015. 
There are a few additional assumptions to contemplate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution from warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. $0.22 to $0.26 of net contribution from PharMEDium and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain confident that biosimilars are an exciting opportunity for ABC and the market. As discussed before, we believe we would have a particularly strong role, especially in the physician-administered biosimilar products. The challenges remain on the legal and regulatory side, which prevent us from being too bullish on what biosimilars could contribute to ABC in the short to medium term. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to take a moment to thank our associates for delivering excellent performance in fiscal 2015. Our value creation is the result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas, and our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is focused. They share my conviction that doing things efficiently and being part -- and being expanding and dynamic channel partner with a view to the future will be what sets ABC apart. The always-improving quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our thoughtful capital management will help us grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for our manufacturer and health care provider customers, our shareholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. 
Now here is Tim."

Our drug company executed extremely well this year. They",2649,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Steve mentioned, we completed another excellent year in ABC. Let me spend a minute and quickly recap a few highlights. 
Our drug company executed extremely well this year. They finished the fiscal year setting internal records for both product service levels and order accuracy for all those customers. Our Specialty Group continues to grow and execute as well. They had their best revenue growth year in the last 8 years, with all the businesses in the portfolio contributing. We added MWI and are in process of closing PharMEDium. Both are respected leaders with high market shares, and both have excellent long-term business prospects. Finally, we exit the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet while virtually eliminating the expected impact of the dilution from the future exercise of the Walgreens warrants. 
I have 4 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. The third topic I will briefly cover, our warrant hedging progress to date. And the fourth and final topic, I will wrap up covering our fiscal '16 expectations.  
So let's begin our Q4 review. The financial results that I provide this  morning will all be on an adjusted basis unless I specifically call them out as being GAAP. Also, please note that all financial comparisons are for the fourth quarter ended September 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. 
For Q4 2015, our revenues increased roughly $4 billion to $35.5 billion, up an outstanding 12%. Our growth on a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, was just under 10%. The quarter's gross profit increased $135 million, 15%, to about $1.1 billion. Almost all of the dollar growth came from our Other segment, primarily as a result of adding MWI. Our pharmaceutical segment was challenged this quarter with a tough comparison, which we anticipated and called out previously, the repricing of the Department of Defense contract and the especially strong contribution from generic price appreciation back in the September 2014 quarter. 
Operating expenses. Our total OpEx increased about $103 million or 20% to $606 million, consistent with the change in gross profit dollars that I just covered. The Other segment drove virtually all of the dollar growth, again, due to the addition of MWI. Operating income was $456 million, up $32 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down about 5 basis points, driven by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 11 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net was about $27 million. 40% of this expense or all of the increase is related to our MWI acquisition financing. 
Income taxes. Our tax rate was 37% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. I should highlight that our tax expense and associated tax rate are higher this quarter because of a onetime $10 million reserve of a deferred tax asset originating from state net operating losses that we will not likely be able to utilize. This negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.04. 
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $1.17, driven primarily by the addition of MWI. Our adjusted diluted share count was 230 million shares, essentially flat to last year. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $34 billion, up 9.5%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company had solid revenue growth up 8%, driven by 2 items. The first item, we benefited by solid volume growth and, to a lesser extent, a strong brand pricing environment. And the second item, we benefited from the final ramp of the Walgreens business. This key customer accounted for about 60% of the increase in revenue dollars. Beginning in Q1 2016, we anniversary the full ramp of the Walgreens business, and we look forward to growing with this customer in the years ahead. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 24%. Similar to the last 3 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our drug company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 15% from higher volumes, a continued good pricing environment and new drug introduction. Specialty's growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs. The sales growth percentages of the drug company and specialty are before intra-segment elimination, consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in the past. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, essentially flat. We saw solid gross profit growth in our specialty business due to their higher revenue growth. Our drug company, even with strong revenue growth and a solid contribution from generic Abilify, was still behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 sizable headwinds that I called out previously. Importantly, let me highlight that these 2 headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the segment in our first quarter 2016. So as you think about our quarterly progression, please remember that these will carry over into the first quarter. The segment's gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points, primarily because of these 2 items. 
Operating expenses were slightly over $400 million and were flat year-over-year. Adjusted segment operating income was $388 million and, again, essentially flat. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the drug company. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, segment revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the low teens. MWI continues to have solid revenue performance as a result of their companion animal business. Excluding the IDEXX impact, companion would have had a growth rate, as a percentage, in the low teens. 
From an operating income standpoint, we had a significant increase, about $30 million, to a total operating income of $68 million. The segment benefited mostly from having MWI included in the quarterly results, but our consulting business also made a very good contribution this quarter. MWI did incur a onetime bad debt expense of about $4 million in the quarter related to a U.K. customer that negatively impacted their results. For those that have followed MWI in the past, you know it's highly unusual for the business to have a bad debt at this dollar level. 
Let me switch gears and cover a large GAAP item that occurred in the quarter. We determined that we have a permanent write-down of $31 million in our equity investment in Profarma, a Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler. The write-down is due to the significant decline in Profarma stock price from our initial investment date to the date of our impairment testing. We concluded that the decline in stock price is other than temporary since the stock price declined significantly over 1 year ago and has not recovered since. Let me point out, our investment in the specialty joint venture, where we are 50/50 owners with Profarma, continues to ramp and is tracking to forecast. Because of this, there is no impairment of our specialty joint venture asset. 
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few key fiscal 2015 financial metrics. Overall, as Steve mentioned, we did very well meeting or exceeding our increased guidance targets. Revenue on a full year basis, our growth was nearly 14%. Excluding the impact from MWI for approximately 7 months, our revenue growth would have been 12%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented roughly 30% of our total ABC revenues in fiscal '15 and finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our specialty business finished the year at $24.4 billion. It was revenue growth of about 24%, both are record. Again, excluding the impact of the oncology drug revenue that shifted, ABSG's revenues on a comparable year-over-year basis was an impressive 15%. 
Our adjusted operating income increased 22% to $1.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.40%, an increase of 10 basis points. MWI, a higher-margin business, drove about half of our 10 basis point improvement. EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.96, up 25%, mostly due to our strong organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefits from a lower consolidated tax rate. 
Cash flow, we are extremely pleased completing the fiscal year with free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We had a positive impact from higher total generic revenues, up more than 30% full year '15 versus full year '14, aided by the onetime ramp of Walgreens generics business. With better working capital metrics, this significant increase in generic volume was an important driver of our extraordinary cash flow this year. Let me also point out that we did have timing differences, which had a positive impact of about $550 million to our free cash flow. 
Duplicate inventory of $150 million, that was a negative in fiscal '14, reversed and helped us in early fiscal '15. We also had about $400 million of timing here recently in September. With 4 business days before Labor Day, we are able to order and receive some brand inventory, sell through and collect most of the AR by September 30 while the AP wasn't due until October. This pulls a working capital benefit forward from fiscal '16. 
That's all I have for comments covering our full year 2015. Next, I will recap our warrant hedging progress. As Steve highlighted, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise, meaning we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreens, most likely in March 2016. This quarter, we also made significant progress against the 2017 warrant. We now believe we are 94% covered based on the September 30 ABC share price. This means the uncovered portion, the 6%, translates to about 1.4 million share shortfall at September 30, 2015. 
As a reminder, the PharMEDium acquisition will help cover, through its income growth, any remaining EPS dilution from the anticipated share shortfall once the 2017 warrant is exercised. I'd ask people to refer to the new table we added in our press release that highlights our capped call option coverage at various ABC share prices, which you should find helpful. 
Now let's turn to our fiscal '16 expectations. The guidance that I provide will include our planned PharMEDium acquisition. Our working assumption is that we will report the business in our fiscal '16 results for about 10 months. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range. Let me provide some overarching comments about revenue growth. Approximately 1% of our expected consolidated revenue growth will be due to having MWI for an incremental 5 months in fiscal '16. PharMEDium will add less than 0.5% to our consolidated revenue growth, and as a reminder, this business will become part of ABDC and will be included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
In terms of segments, we expect Pharmaceutical Distribution to grow revenues in the high single digits. Within the segment, our specialty business is expected to grow, as a percentage, in the low teens. We expect our Other segment's revenues to grow about 30%, which is aided by having MWI for the full fiscal year. 
Gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but here are a few key assumptions. Generic price inflation, consistent with what we communicated in the past, we expect to see some moderation in the dollar contribution amount in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Consequently, this represents a headwind for us, especially in quarter 1. Brand drug inflation, we expect to see some moderation in the inflation rates. Generic drug launches, we expect a better year in terms of dollar contribution. Contract renewals. As we have previously stated, ABDC will have a headwind for the first 2 quarters from the Department of Defense renewal, and in the last quarter, we will have the impact from the Kaiser contract, which we are working hard to renew. 
Next, operating expenses. We expect a fairly high percentage of -- fairly high percentage growth rate in this area due to adding the incremental 5 months of MWI and, to a lesser degree, PharMEDium. About 60% of the consolidated expense increase will be related to these 2 new businesses. A portion of the remaining increase is related to additional IT and DC infrastructure costs related to our large CapEx projects. Examples of the costs include duplicate costs to run parallel IT systems, additional labor and start-up costs that can't be capitalized. 
Operating income. We expect operating income dollars to grow between 16% and 18%, driven primarily by ABDC and the addition of PharMEDium. Also, we have the benefit of having MWI for the complete fiscal year.  Switching to operating margin. We expect our margin in basis points to be up 8 to 12 basis points due primarily to the addition of higher-margin businesses. 
Interest expense. Our interest expense is expected to increase significantly, 35% to 40%, due to having a full year of financing relating to MWI and the new financing for PharMEDium. Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 35.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes that our adjusted share count will increase by about 1% in fiscal '16. This is due to curtailing our regular share repurchases until we make progress on our credit metrics, getting them back to target levels. As we make progress against our obligations during the year, we will be thoughtful, as always, with our capital deployment. 
Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.90, an increase of 15% to 19% over our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS of $4.96. This range includes the benefit of the PharMEDium acquisition that we've highlighted previously, a net contribution of $0.22 to $0.26 for ABC. Relative to the 2 large headwinds I've called out previously, that DoD contract renewal and moderation in generic price appreciation, it's important, again, to cover our expected EPS quarterly progression. We expect Q1 to have growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. By the time we get to Q4, we expect EPS growth to be in the low 20% range. 
Switching to our cash flow. CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million. Given our cash outlook, we believe this is the right time to invest in our core drug business and, specifically, our distribution center network. We plan to spend about 25% of our CapEx to build 1 new distribution center and also replace or upgrade 4 existing DCs. We also expect to spend an incremental $100 million on IT infrastructure projects, including 2 large multiyear projects, a data center consolidation and a new business operating system for our consulting business. 
Free cash flow. We expect to return to a more normalized free cash flow this fiscal year. And as we anniversary the benefit of the significant increase in our generics business, consequently, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. 
In summary, I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to covering several topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention. Like Steve, I'd like to personally thank all the ABC associates for the efforts made this year, delivering these outstanding financial results. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, and we believe the company continues on the right course to deliver long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in ABC.

The acquisition idea has been very well received by health systems customers. We had some -- one of our biggest customers said, ""Did you guys take your balls off?"" [ph] That was one of the comments they gave us back. But we had a quick diligence here. It's not of the overall footprint of, say, even a smaller acquisition like World Courier, with 4 very large compounding pharmacies, in which we manage to visit all of them during our diligence. But we're excited. And we think that there will be a very interactive dialogue, both with the FDA and other regulators, but we expect that we will continue to set the bar for quality in this area. And we think that the service will be -- it's not a commodity service at all. This is a high-quality service that is complex, and like I said when we announced it, if my family was being -- was getting a sterile IV, I'd like it to come from PharMEDium. I can't believe that a hospital on its own can create the center of excellence that a company like PharMEDium can fully be sterile preparation. So we're expecting to close some time in the next 2 to 3 weeks because we were having those bad years [ph] from SEC . But we're well positioned to close, and we're excited to bring them onboard.

It's really early because, obviously, we weren't under the tent [ph] -- we anticipated that WBA would be a consolidator. That's one of the reasons why we entered into this very comprehensive relationship with them. And so far, that thesis has proved to be very, very intact, and. We were -- irrespective of any consolidation, we were expanding our network. Some of our centers definitely have been around 30 years. I remember when I joined Bergen, for example, in 1994, that Houston was the standard and Mansfield. Those are some of the ones that are now older. They were the standard, most modern DCs in our network. So it's definitely time that -- we needed to expand the network. But I think it's a good example of us investing in our core business and being ready for new developments and new growth. We are with the customers that are growing the fastest, many of them. That is something that is always evident in our thinking when we select who we're going to try to retain and who we're going to go after in a competitive or a beat off [ph] situation. So -- and then our exposure to specialty is a benefit to us, not only in growth but also in any changes in price increases. Because specialty drugs, because of ASD in particular, have a lower exposure to price increases historically than other brand drugs and more the oral solid top brand drugs and established therapies, even the self-administered ones with MS and rheumatoid arthritis, for example. Typically, those physician-administers have the lowest exposure to price increases. So another good thing about our business, so we were very well prepared. We've announced 4 new DCs and one that will be completed this year, and we're looking more like the Orlando models with these new larger DCs, where we have 300,000 to 400,000 square feet. So it's really impressive, and we use the same footprint. It's very efficient. We've retained a lot of the people that worked on the AmerisourceBergen integration, and we've retained very good engineering and distribution, science department that continues to perform excellently for us. And we use them to consult with customers on different project as well, so they're a great resource for us. It's probably something we don't talk about enough. So many things..."

So we continue to have great discussions about bucket 3. I'd tell you bucket 2, which is the sourcing, has been terrific. We still think we're the most global. We have overall still the largest sourcing, contracting ability. And I think you've seen Stefano's really strong inclination to growth, both organically and through acquisition, and Alex having a strong focus on the customer experience in the stores.

And I don't expect that -- we'd probably see more resumption to the low teens or even high single digits. That's the range that we would see. Again, ABC, our portfolio is very geared towards specialty, which, as I've said a little while ago, because of ASP, on the physician side, you don't see the big increases there that you see in other sectors. So we think that pharmaceuticals still, of course, provide excellent health care efficiency. And especially when they're administered in the correct settings with the right sort of adherence programs, that's the best driver of -- one of the best drivers of value. So we -- and I think manufacturers -- I think you just have a lot of therapies that provide excellent value. And then I look at new therapies being introduced and the efficacy of those drugs, and I think there's been a propensity to increase that. But we -- I think the change generally gets overestimated and things take a lot longer than you expect. And a good example I can give you is the pedigree rule. Everyone knew that it had to be made -- it had to be passed, it made sense but it was going to cause a lot of inefficiency in the system. So the states started passing their own pedigree rule, but it's very, very hard to get legislation passed, as you know.

The best way and the most practical way for an ABC customer to exit the WBAD benefit is through our ProGen formulary, and we are focused every day on making that the best overall value basket. And so it doesn't -- it's not really the headline news, but it's one of the -- we do this monthly business reviews and the first -- I think on Page 8 or 9, we start getting to ProGen volume. And when I get the data, I know it's the first thing I look at, how we're doing in ProGen because it's so important to us and it's a key driver. And ABC, I think, with the SAP implementation and with Bob Mauch coming on as President and his strong analytical background, our analytics gets stronger and stronger all the time. And it's very complex because there's 2,000 important generic products, and a lot of our customers are in the market. And it was -- outside of our usual peers, there's also some other companies that get into generic telemarketing, and some of those are even operated by our peer companies. So it's a very dynamic marketplace, and we focus every day on making sure our customers understand it. Recently, I've been really impressed with some of the dashboard tools we have so that our sales reps can do incredible deals, have great access to very powerful and up-to-date tools to show customers exactly what the true net pricing is, taking into account full rebate, et cetera. So we're doing a great job. I think we'll carry on getting even better. Again, the Alliance Boots heritage, I think people really understand how we need to compete against short line wholesalers, et cetera. So there's a lot of strong commonality we have. And then Peyton's group being based in Bern, I think, is also very helpful. So that might be one way to answer your question. Just quickly, I know because we're coming close to -- we actually are over our time. GNP, with David who's being fully focused on that, we've announced that we had our strongest new level of service offering. We called it the next generation of services, and a lot of that is around adherence. A lot of it is around new network program. A lot of that is really encouraging the highest level of compliance from our customers. So that's all going well.

That's why -- we do have inflation baked in there. We do sell a large mix of brand drugs. But at the end of the day, large customers, like a Walgreens and like a Kaiser and others, the GPOs, grow faster, and that helps us. and let's not forget we also have specialty, a strong franchise set that we called out should grow in the low teens for '16. So we're pretty optimistic about our top line revenue growth. In terms of margin, margins will be flattish. Again, I called out that we're going to be up 10 basis points in '16, with most of that coming from the new businesses. So that's MWI and PharMEDium. We're really focused on growing on operating dollars. I mean, that's what we do, and that's first and foremost. And then sometimes, the margin is challenged because of these large customers and the pricing they get, so it puts a little bit of margin pressure on the P&L.

I think one thing we try to do, if you just -- I would love to make this comment because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of.

I think one thing we try to do, if you just -- I would love to make this comment because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of. If you look at -- set aside the $3.7 billion we had in cash flow in fiscal year '15 and go to the more normalized rate we predicted, but you'll note that it's almost double our EPS growth rate, a little bit less than that. Of course, when you look at it, it's only takes about 6 days [ph] sales. However, we've done a great job of taking that cash flow and managing through the warrant hedging, which has been significant, We over $2 billion about. And then 2 acquisitions with our strong balance sheet that will differentiate us both in services and margins. MWI, I think was what I understood. But PharMEDium, if you look at their financial performance, it's been absolutely, for a large business, one of the most impressive growth rates I've seen since our early days of specialty. It's pretty -- their financial performance is what really, really attracted our attention and our ability that we can carry on driving significant numbers. So if you look at the job ABC is doing, we're investing in our core businesses with differentiated, complex, higher-margin services, and that cash flow is what gives us ability to do it. And we've always said our first pride is great internal projects. So for example, when I was in Heathrow this week, there's a $300,000 testing machine that they're going to buy, which will save us $300,000 a year in testing expenses, not anything we'd normally talk about, but that's a great example of why internal investments work the best for us. Our national distribution [ph] center has been an absolute home run, particularly now as we bring it into fiscal year '16. SAP, it cost us a lot more than we expected, but we couldn't have done the things we've done without it. So that's pride #1. Pride #2 is World Courier, PharMEDium and MWI. And PharMEDium, still early to pull [ph]. But MWI, I think, and World Courier, we feel terrific about the way we've been able to bring in the people, the customers and the suppliers. So I think we're doing the job that you're all paying us to do very, very well. And I just wouldn't, look, underestimate the importance of that cash flow and how it's putting into our ability to carry on managing our margins, our growth rates and invest both in internal and external projects. So I just -- I did want to make that point as we wrapped up. 
So thanks, Eric. And I'll just conclude by saying how proud we are of our performance this year. It really has been a great couple of years. We're excited about developments in the marketplace. No one can accuse our sector of being boring at all, And this is an incredibly dynamic time to be in this industry. And I'm just really proud of the way ABC is positioned, the way we're approaching customers, the way we're approaching associates.

We've actually changed locations within our headquarters here, so the train should not be very prominent today. And I'm sure you all appreciate that. 
I am just tremendously proud of the results that we are presenting today, and I commend our highly engaged associates for the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved this year. Our success is being driven by the approach we take to  marketplace. We constantly seek to examine our industry with fresh eyes. We boldly take the steps that are necessary to avail ourselves of the opportunities that we see unfolding, and we work collaboratively and creatively to address challenges we see in front of us and our partners in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed, our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing innovative solutions for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers. Our results are a testament to precision and proficiency with which we run our business and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders.
In financial terms, we exceeded all of our expectations for fiscal year 2015. Our revenues for the full year were up 14% to $136 billion, and adjusted earnings per share from continued operations -- from continuing operations were up 25% to $4.96. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong this year, coming in at a record $3.7 billion. The strength of our financial position enable us to make important strategic investments, including the acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and, most recently, the pending acquisition of PharMEDium. The addition of these 2 high-quality acquisitions to the AmerisourceBergen portfolio demonstrates our commitment to the pharmaceutical supply channel and the opportunities we see inherent in it. It also highlights our ability to extend our existing capability into new markets and to continuously enhance the services we are able to provide to our existing customers. 
We could not have made these 2 significant investments in the same calendar year if we did not have tremendous confidence in our ability to manage complex, diverse businesses that enhance the level of range and services that we provide to the market. Moreover, in addition to making these investments, we have also made substantial progress in offsetting the expected impact of warrant exercises we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. At this stage, we have essentially completely offset the impact of the warrants, and I'm very proud that we have so adroitly been able to fulfill a commitment which we made to our shareholders when we first entered into the long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
This relationship, which will be coming up to our 3-year anniversary, has, thus far, been a tremendous success, and we look forward to many more benefits in the years ahead. We selected WBA as our long-term partner not only for cultural fit, but also because we believe they were the best long-term partner for us in the retail chain space. And certainly, their performance as our largest customer and sourcing partner has been a very significant contributor to our performance over the last few years. 
Our operational execution was also very strong this year. All our customers have benefited from enhancements we have made to our infrastructure, and we have certainly been realizing the benefits of the increasing scale of our business, where we have more than doubled the number of lines we manage over the last 25 months. We have also continued to execute on our advanced programs and services for our manufacturer customers, including those provided by AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. 
While we have substantially strengthened our core business over the last few years, we always feel like we can and should do better. 
Our customers are being challenged, and they want and should expect that we will step up in new and innovative ways as well. But this is what excites and motivates our team. We also continue to work on the associate experience part of our business, and I feel we are not only attracting and, importantly, retaining exceptional talent, but we are being recognized for our culture in the marketplace. Just this week, we were named one of the coolest places to work in Philadelphia by Philadelphia magazine. Not that you can put this in our EPS guidance, but it's still a recognition that we are proud of. 
For many, many years, wholesalers have proven to be one of the most resilient and reliable components of the pharmacy core channel. Over the last 2 years, our entire industry has successfully transformed itself in order to better address the changing and consolidating needs of the health care landscape. Wholesalers have proven to be adept at providing value that goes well beyond the essential services of aggregating demand and the logistics of getting products from one point to another safely and securely. We help enable efficient pharmaceutical care and the widest possible access to products, which allows our customers to focus on expertly caring for their patients. 
It remains an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are solid. Health reform initiatives continue to improve access to care, and new and innovative products are coming to market. In recent years, we have seen new products come to market that dramatically improved the lives of patients and, often, in cost effective ways. The R&D pipeline remains full of promising new products, and the combination of advanced therapies and improving access to care not only drives growth opportunities but, most importantly, meaningfully improves patients' lives. 
The high percentage of generic scripts in the market also helped pharmaceutical care be an even greater driver of efficient health care for the many of the therapies that we deliver. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapy across all sites of care. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. Tim will provide the financial details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter, with revenues up 8% even as we continue to fully anniversary the onboarding of the Walgreens business. Our growth was driven in large part by solid organic volume growth. While generic drug inflation has slowed meaningfully over the course of the year, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chain, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. 
Last quarter, I spoke about enhancements we have made to our programs for our independent pharmacy customers. The opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists, the impact of delivery of health care in the U.S. will be an important contributor to our growth going forward. For many years, we have been proud advocates for community pharmacies that increasingly provide some of the most important touch points to ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care.  
We also remain very active with regulators and legislators, both independently and through our trade associations, to expertly advise and inform those important constituents on pertinent issues for our industry and our customers, especially with respect to issues regarding the safety and security of the pharmaceutical supply channel. With the close of the September quarter, we have now fully anniversaried the onboarding of the Walgreens distribution business. Since the implementation of this historic distribution contract, Walgreens has exceeded our internal growth estimates as a customer this quarter, this year and last year. 
As our retail business has grown substantially over the last 2 fiscal years, we've also had strong performance in our health systems and alternate site segments. In early October, we were very pleased to announce the definitive agreement to acquire PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. This acquisition represents an important investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to our health system customers, a customer segment that is playing increasingly important role in the provision of health care in the U.S. PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality CSPs in key therapeutic orders -- areas, combined with their impressive track record of growth, made them a compelling addition to ABDC. Because we expect PharMEDium to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and we expect the transaction to close during the first quarter, we have included the anticipated contribution from PharMEDium in the guidance we are giving for fiscal 2016 today. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturer-imposed changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenue from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up an impressive 15%. Our physician distribution businesses, ASD and our community oncology business, all performed very well in the quarter. We continue to be very confident and proud of our specialty franchise. 
Our market share -- our market leadership in this area is rooted in customer intimacy and deep experience. This important knowledge has been the inspiration for the investments we have made in this business and the portfolio of service we have developed over many years. Our capability to extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. I believe the true differentiator of our specialty business is our collaborative approach to bringing innovative solutions to both our physician and manufacturer customers. 
Working in concert with our business partners is the best way to both discover and deliver value in the long run, especially in a marketplace that is increasingly focused on the cost of care. During the year, our GSMR, global supply manufacturer relations business unit, based principally out of Bern, Switzerland, also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, has made important inroads on the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of professionalism and coordination between suppliers and our customers. This also includes an almost 24/7 communication rhythm with our partners at WBAD.
Let's turn now to the other segments. We had a full quarter of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on their integration. We have met with most of the large animal health manufacturers and made good progress on the identification of synergies. One area where we see a lot of opportunity is in sharing and enhancing technology, not just in our warehouses and distribution centers but also in the systems and proven methodologies with which we interact with customers and suppliers. We have made a few tuck-in acquisitions in this area, specifically over the last several months, and while they are small relative to the size of our total business, they are very important to the future of the animal health platform. 
The companion animal business was especially strong in the September quarter with growth in the low teens. I have to say that with just 7 completed months on our belt, we are delighted by how the MWI integration into ABC has gone. Moreover, we feel very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016, and we'll make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we add this complex new segment to our business. MWI's willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their ongoing commitment to outstanding execution and customer service gives us great confidence in the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. 
Our manufacturer services business also had a solid September quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence program and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacturer services and clinical trial logistic businesses further expand our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products, launched in most of the developed world. 
As I've said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segment. Better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics drive organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Advances in veterinary medicine improve the quality of life of companion animals and give pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, increasing global demand for protein drive the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has garnered in the U.S. into developing global markets. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, and as I mentioned last quarter, there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we ask you to bear in mind as you think about our growth rates for next year. Tim will cover the specifics of our expectations, but I want to highlight a few areas. First, the tailwinds: continued solid organic revenue growth, driven primarily by customer and product mix; better generic launch outlooks; and 5 months incremental benefit from MWI. The headwinds are: significant impact from DoD contract repricing in the first half of this current -- of this recently past fiscal year; other customer contract renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016, notably Kaiser, whose contract expires late in the fiscal year, and as we have shared before, that contract will be about 7 years from when we first entered into this generation of a contract; third, declining dollar contribution from generic inflation; no onetime benefits from some of the cash flow drivers we experienced in fiscal year 2015. 
There are a few additional assumptions to contemplate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no dilution from warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. $0.22 to $0.26 of net contribution from PharMEDium and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain confident that biosimilars are an exciting opportunity for ABC and the market. As discussed before, we believe we would have a particularly strong role, especially in the physician-administered biosimilar products. The challenges remain on the legal and regulatory side, which prevent us from being too bullish on what biosimilars could contribute to ABC in the short to medium term. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to take a moment to thank our associates for delivering excellent performance in fiscal 2015. Our value creation is the result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas, and our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is focused. They share my conviction that doing things efficiently and being part -- and being expanding and dynamic channel partner with a view to the future will be what sets ABC apart. The always-improving quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our thoughtful capital management will help us grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for our manufacturer and health care provider customers, our shareholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. 
Now here is Tim."

Our drug company executed extremely well this year. They",2649,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Steve mentioned, we completed another excellent year in ABC. Let me spend a minute and quickly recap a few highlights. 
Our drug company executed extremely well this year. They finished the fiscal year setting internal records for both product service levels and order accuracy for all those customers. Our Specialty Group continues to grow and execute as well. They had their best revenue growth year in the last 8 years, with all the businesses in the portfolio contributing. We added MWI and are in process of closing PharMEDium. Both are respected leaders with high market shares, and both have excellent long-term business prospects. Finally, we exit the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet while virtually eliminating the expected impact of the dilution from the future exercise of the Walgreens warrants. 
I have 4 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. The third topic I will briefly cover, our warrant hedging progress to date. And the fourth and final topic, I will wrap up covering our fiscal '16 expectations.  
So let's begin our Q4 review. The financial results that I provide this  morning will all be on an adjusted basis unless I specifically call them out as being GAAP. Also, please note that all financial comparisons are for the fourth quarter ended September 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. 
For Q4 2015, our revenues increased roughly $4 billion to $35.5 billion, up an outstanding 12%. Our growth on a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, was just under 10%. The quarter's gross profit increased $135 million, 15%, to about $1.1 billion. Almost all of the dollar growth came from our Other segment, primarily as a result of adding MWI. Our pharmaceutical segment was challenged this quarter with a tough comparison, which we anticipated and called out previously, the repricing of the Department of Defense contract and the especially strong contribution from generic price appreciation back in the September 2014 quarter. 
Operating expenses. Our total OpEx increased about $103 million or 20% to $606 million, consistent with the change in gross profit dollars that I just covered. The Other segment drove virtually all of the dollar growth, again, due to the addition of MWI. Operating income was $456 million, up $32 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down about 5 basis points, driven by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 11 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net was about $27 million. 40% of this expense or all of the increase is related to our MWI acquisition financing. 
Income taxes. Our tax rate was 37% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. I should highlight that our tax expense and associated tax rate are higher this quarter because of a onetime $10 million reserve of a deferred tax asset originating from state net operating losses that we will not likely be able to utilize. This negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.04. 
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $1.17, driven primarily by the addition of MWI. Our adjusted diluted share count was 230 million shares, essentially flat to last year. 
Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $34 billion, up 9.5%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company had solid revenue growth up 8%, driven by 2 items. The first item, we benefited by solid volume growth and, to a lesser extent, a strong brand pricing environment. And the second item, we benefited from the final ramp of the Walgreens business. This key customer accounted for about 60% of the increase in revenue dollars. Beginning in Q1 2016, we anniversary the full ramp of the Walgreens business, and we look forward to growing with this customer in the years ahead. 
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 24%. Similar to the last 3 quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our drug company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 15% from higher volumes, a continued good pricing environment and new drug introduction. Specialty's growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs. The sales growth percentages of the drug company and specialty are before intra-segment elimination, consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in the past. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, essentially flat. We saw solid gross profit growth in our specialty business due to their higher revenue growth. Our drug company, even with strong revenue growth and a solid contribution from generic Abilify, was still behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 sizable headwinds that I called out previously. Importantly, let me highlight that these 2 headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the segment in our first quarter 2016. So as you think about our quarterly progression, please remember that these will carry over into the first quarter. The segment's gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points, primarily because of these 2 items. 
Operating expenses were slightly over $400 million and were flat year-over-year. Adjusted segment operating income was $388 million and, again, essentially flat. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the drug company. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, segment revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the low teens. MWI continues to have solid revenue performance as a result of their companion animal business. Excluding the IDEXX impact, companion would have had a growth rate, as a percentage, in the low teens. 
From an operating income standpoint, we had a significant increase, about $30 million, to a total operating income of $68 million. The segment benefited mostly from having MWI included in the quarterly results, but our consulting business also made a very good contribution this quarter. MWI did incur a onetime bad debt expense of about $4 million in the quarter related to a U.K. customer that negatively impacted their results. For those that have followed MWI in the past, you know it's highly unusual for the business to have a bad debt at this dollar level. 
Let me switch gears and cover a large GAAP item that occurred in the quarter. We determined that we have a permanent write-down of $31 million in our equity investment in Profarma, a Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler. The write-down is due to the significant decline in Profarma stock price from our initial investment date to the date of our impairment testing. We concluded that the decline in stock price is other than temporary since the stock price declined significantly over 1 year ago and has not recovered since. Let me point out, our investment in the specialty joint venture, where we are 50/50 owners with Profarma, continues to ramp and is tracking to forecast. Because of this, there is no impairment of our specialty joint venture asset. 
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few key fiscal 2015 financial metrics. Overall, as Steve mentioned, we did very well meeting or exceeding our increased guidance targets. Revenue on a full year basis, our growth was nearly 14%. Excluding the impact from MWI for approximately 7 months, our revenue growth would have been 12%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented roughly 30% of our total ABC revenues in fiscal '15 and finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our specialty business finished the year at $24.4 billion. It was revenue growth of about 24%, both are record. Again, excluding the impact of the oncology drug revenue that shifted, ABSG's revenues on a comparable year-over-year basis was an impressive 15%. 
Our adjusted operating income increased 22% to $1.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.40%, an increase of 10 basis points. MWI, a higher-margin business, drove about half of our 10 basis point improvement. EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.96, up 25%, mostly due to our strong organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefits from a lower consolidated tax rate. 
Cash flow, we are extremely pleased completing the fiscal year with free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We had a positive impact from higher total generic revenues, up more than 30% full year '15 versus full year '14, aided by the onetime ramp of Walgreens generics business. With better working capital metrics, this significant increase in generic volume was an important driver of our extraordinary cash flow this year. Let me also point out that we did have timing differences, which had a positive impact of about $550 million to our free cash flow. 
Duplicate inventory of $150 million, that was a negative in fiscal '14, reversed and helped us in early fiscal '15. We also had about $400 million of timing here recently in September. With 4 business days before Labor Day, we are able to order and receive some brand inventory, sell through and collect most of the AR by September 30 while the AP wasn't due until October. This pulls a working capital benefit forward from fiscal '16. 
That's all I have for comments covering our full year 2015. Next, I will recap our warrant hedging progress. As Steve highlighted, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise, meaning we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreens, most likely in March 2016. This quarter, we also made significant progress against the 2017 warrant. We now believe we are 94% covered based on the September 30 ABC share price. This means the uncovered portion, the 6%, translates to about 1.4 million share shortfall at September 30, 2015. 
As a reminder, the PharMEDium acquisition will help cover, through its income growth, any remaining EPS dilution from the anticipated share shortfall once the 2017 warrant is exercised. I'd ask people to refer to the new table we added in our press release that highlights our capped call option coverage at various ABC share prices, which you should find helpful. 
Now let's turn to our fiscal '16 expectations. The guidance that I provide will include our planned PharMEDium acquisition. Our working assumption is that we will report the business in our fiscal '16 results for about 10 months. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range. Let me provide some overarching comments about revenue growth. Approximately 1% of our expected consolidated revenue growth will be due to having MWI for an incremental 5 months in fiscal '16. PharMEDium will add less than 0.5% to our consolidated revenue growth, and as a reminder, this business will become part of ABDC and will be included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
In terms of segments, we expect Pharmaceutical Distribution to grow revenues in the high single digits. Within the segment, our specialty business is expected to grow, as a percentage, in the low teens. We expect our Other segment's revenues to grow about 30%, which is aided by having MWI for the full fiscal year. 
Gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but here are a few key assumptions. Generic price inflation, consistent with what we communicated in the past, we expect to see some moderation in the dollar contribution amount in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Consequently, this represents a headwind for us, especially in quarter 1. Brand drug inflation, we expect to see some moderation in the inflation rates. Generic drug launches, we expect a better year in terms of dollar contribution. Contract renewals. As we have previously stated, ABDC will have a headwind for the first 2 quarters from the Department of Defense renewal, and in the last quarter, we will have the impact from the Kaiser contract, which we are working hard to renew. 
Next, operating expenses. We expect a fairly high percentage of -- fairly high percentage growth rate in this area due to adding the incremental 5 months of MWI and, to a lesser degree, PharMEDium. About 60% of the consolidated expense increase will be related to these 2 new businesses. A portion of the remaining increase is related to additional IT and DC infrastructure costs related to our large CapEx projects. Examples of the costs include duplicate costs to run parallel IT systems, additional labor and start-up costs that can't be capitalized. 
Operating income. We expect operating income dollars to grow between 16% and 18%, driven primarily by ABDC and the addition of PharMEDium. Also, we have the benefit of having MWI for the complete fiscal year.  Switching to operating margin. We expect our margin in basis points to be up 8 to 12 basis points due primarily to the addition of higher-margin businesses. 
Interest expense. Our interest expense is expected to increase significantly, 35% to 40%, due to having a full year of financing relating to MWI and the new financing for PharMEDium. Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 35.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes that our adjusted share count will increase by about 1% in fiscal '16. This is due to curtailing our regular share repurchases until we make progress on our credit metrics, getting them back to target levels. As we make progress against our obligations during the year, we will be thoughtful, as always, with our capital deployment. 
Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.90, an increase of 15% to 19% over our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS of $4.96. This range includes the benefit of the PharMEDium acquisition that we've highlighted previously, a net contribution of $0.22 to $0.26 for ABC. Relative to the 2 large headwinds I've called out previously, that DoD contract renewal and moderation in generic price appreciation, it's important, again, to cover our expected EPS quarterly progression. We expect Q1 to have growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. By the time we get to Q4, we expect EPS growth to be in the low 20% range. 
Switching to our cash flow. CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million. Given our cash outlook, we believe this is the right time to invest in our core drug business and, specifically, our distribution center network. We plan to spend about 25% of our CapEx to build 1 new distribution center and also replace or upgrade 4 existing DCs. We also expect to spend an incremental $100 million on IT infrastructure projects, including 2 large multiyear projects, a data center consolidation and a new business operating system for our consulting business. 
Free cash flow. We expect to return to a more normalized free cash flow this fiscal year. And as we anniversary the benefit of the significant increase in our generics business, consequently, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. 
In summary, I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to covering several topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention. Like Steve, I'd like to personally thank all the ABC associates for the efforts made this year, delivering these outstanding financial results. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, and we believe the company continues on the right course to deliver long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in ABC.

I mean, these are actually some of the things that MWI appreciate about joining ABC, is a lot of the development programs we have. And yes, I think the culture is something that truly is setting us more and more apart with enthusiasm and passion people have for the business. For example, I was in our World Courier office in London on Monday, I'd tell you, it's very infectious, the passion that group has. Essentially, it's the same people that were there when we acquired the company, and that was the last time I was there, was actually just a little bit after we completed the acquisition. But the same is true wherever we go. I was in Ireland with our BluePoint folks Friday. So just -- but more importantly, from a scale perspective, the U.S. business is also very true of that, whether it's Frisco, the specialty group in Charlotte, the Consulting Services in Philadelphia and all our drug company regions. So just pointing out that our culture is really a strong driver of our performance, and the confidence that Tim and I have that we can pull off 2 fairly complex deals like this, we -- $5 billion in acquisitions in 1 year is definitely a sign that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute."

And now that's turned out to be what we think is probably one of the key drivers for our investment decision here, the quality requirements that are going to come that are already resident in that business, and we think that will only improve, increase the vigilance that will be required from the pharmacies. And the scale is only going to increase. And we were just so impressed with the competitive  differentiation and the commitment to quality. The acquisition idea has been very well received by health systems customers. We had some -- one of our biggest customers said, ""Did you guys take your balls off?"" [ph] That was one of the comments they gave us back. But we had a quick diligence here. It's not of the overall footprint of, say, even a smaller acquisition like World Courier, with 4 very large compounding pharmacies, in which we manage to visit all of them during our diligence. But we're excited. And we think that there will be a very interactive dialogue, both with the FDA and other regulators, but we expect that we will continue to set the bar for quality in this area. And we think that the service will be -- it's not a commodity service at all. This is a high-quality service that is complex, and like I said when we announced it, if my family was being -- was getting a sterile IV, I'd like it to come from PharMEDium. I can't believe that a hospital on its own can create the center of excellence that a company like PharMEDium can fully be sterile preparation. So we're expecting to close some time in the next 2 to 3 weeks. We haven't heard back yet from FCC but we're well positioned to close, and we're excited to bring them onboard. And we do expect that we will close fairly shortly because Tim wouldn't include it in guidance if we haven't had that strong expectation. So Tim, anything else to add?"

It's really early because, obviously, we weren't under the tent [ph] -- we anticipated that WBA would be a consolidator. That's one of the reasons why we entered into this very comprehensive relationship with them. And so far, that piece has proved to be very, very intact, and. We were -- irrespective of any consolidation, we were expanding our network. Some of our centers definitely have been around 30 years. I remember when I joined Bergen, for example, in 1994, that Houston was the standard in Mansfield. Those are some of the ones that are now older. They were the standard, most modern DCs in our network. So it's definitely time that -- we needed to expand the network. But I think it's a good example of us investing in our core business and being ready for new developments and new growth. We are with the customers that are growing the fastest, many of them. That is something that is always evident in our thinking when we select who we're going to try to retain and who we're going to go after in a competitive RFP-type situation. So -- and then our exposure to specialty is a benefit to us, not only in growth but also in any changes in price increases. Because specialty drugs, because of ASD in particular, have a lower exposure to price increases historically than other brand drugs and more  the oral solid top brand drugs and established therapies, even the self-administered ones with MS and rheumatoid arthritis, for example. Typically, those physician-administers have the lowest exposure to price increases. So another  good thing about our business, so we were very well prepared. We've announced 4 new DCs and one that will be completed this year, and we're looking more like the Orlando models with these new larger DCs, where we have 300,000 to 400,000 square feet. So it's really impressive, and we use the same footprint. It's very efficient. We've retained a lot of the people that worked on the AmerisourceBergen integration, and we've retained very good engineering and distribution, science department that continues to perform excellently for us. And we use them to consult with customers on different project as well, so they're a great resource for us. It's probably something we don't talk about enough. So many things..."

Clinics is one that we pride some models on, for example, but also network co-development. So those are the areas. And I think having Ornella on our board, who's been a champion of independent pharmacy in Europe and having, I suppose, Stefano and Ornella and a lot of the former Alliance Boots people, having more exposures to the U.S. market, but the wonderful heritage that they have in wholesale, I think, is going to really bode well for us also. So we continue to have great discussions about bucket 3. I'd tell you bucket 2, which is the sourcing, has been terrific. We still think we're the most global. We have overall still the largest sourcing, contracting ability. And I think you've seen Stefano's really strong inclination to growth, both organically and through acquisition, and Alex having a strong focus on the customer experience in the stores. So we're very pleased with where we are. And there's more chances [ph] in international specialty. I think we did -- a lot that we're working on. It's just -- within the type  of size that they are, but even AmerisourceBergen is as well, it's hard for them to show up directly in any of the results from quarter-to-quarter, but you will see a long trend, I believe, towards more collaboration and joint innovation, co-investments we're looking at in a few markets, et cetera."

And I don't expect that -- we'd probably see more resumption to the low teens or even high single digits. That's the range that we would see. Again, ABC, our portfolio is very geared towards specialty, which, as I've said a little while ago, because of ASP, on the physician side, you don't see the big increases there that you see in other sectors. So we think that pharmaceuticals still, of course, provide excellent health care efficiency. And especially when they're administered in the correct settings with the right sort of adherence programs, that's the best driver of -- one of the biggest drivers of value. So we -- and I think manufacturers -- I think you just have a lot of therapies that provide excellent value. And then I look at new therapies being introduced and the efficacy of those drugs, and I think there's been a propensity to increase that. But we -- I think the change generally gets overestimated and things take a lot longer than you expect. And a good example I can give you is the pedigree rule. Everyone knew that it had to be made -- it had to be passed, it made sense but it was going to cause a lot of inefficiency in the system. So the states started passing down pedigree rule, but it's very, very hard to get legislation passed, as you know.

And so it doesn't -- it's not really the headline news, but it's one of the -- we do this monthly business reviews and the first -- I think on Page 8 or 9, we start getting to ProGen volume. And when I get the data, I know it's the first thing I look at, how we're doing in ProGen because it's so important to us and it's a key driver. And ABC, I think, with the SAP implementation and with Bob Mauch coming on as President and his strong analytical background, our analytics  gets stronger and stronger all the time. And it's very complex because there's 2,000 important generic products, and a lot of our customers are in the market. And it was -- outside of our usual peers, there's also some other companies that get into generic telemarketing, and some of those are even operated by our peer companies. So it's a very dynamic marketplace, and we focus every day on making sure our customers understand it. Recently, I've been really impressed with some of the dashboard tools we have so that our sales reps can do incredible deals, have great access to very powerful and up-to-date tools to show customers exactly what the true net pricing is, taking into account full rebate, et cetera. So we're doing a great job. I think we'll carry on getting even better. Again, the Alliance Boots heritage, I think people really understand how we need to compete against short line wholesalers, et cetera. So there's a lot of strong commonality we have. And then Peyton's group being based in Bern, I think, is also very helpful. So that might be one way to answer your question.  Just quickly, I know because we're coming close to -- we actually are over our time. GNP, with David who's being fully focused on that, we've announced that we had our strongest new level of service offering. We called it the next generation of services, and a lot of that is around adherence. A lot of it is around new network program. A lot of that is really encouraging the highest level of compliance from our customers. So that's all going well.

I'm looking at 8% to 10% growth, less, of course, a little bit of acquisition. These are high numbers relative to recent history. It sounds like you're taking a prudent amount of brand inflation, perhaps returning to the mean a bit from this high-growth year. As you look at 8% to 10% or maybe it's 6.5% to 8% once you pull in acquisitions, do you think that's the sustainable growth rate going forward? And then as you look to your margin, on the growth that you're getting here, obviously, we don't have generic conversion in the same way. In fact, we have generic inflation working against us. How do you think about the margin profile and your ability to drive margins, understanding that you have a couple of factors working against you this year?"

And they're large and they're fast growers so that we think we're advantaged in that way to grow faster than the market. I think we've proven that the last few years. That's why -- we do have inflation baked in there. We do sell a large mix of brand drugs. But at the end of the day, large customers, like a Walgreens and like a Kaiser and others, the GPOs, grow faster, and that helps us. and let's not forget we also have specialty, a strong franchise set that we called out should grow in the low teens for '16. So we're pretty optimistic about our top line revenue growth. In terms of margin, margins will be flattish. Again, I called out that we're going to be up 10 basis points in '16, with most of that coming from the new businesses. So that's MWI and PharMEDium. We're really focused on growing on operating dollars. I mean, that's what we do, and that's first and foremost. And then sometimes, the margin is challenged because of these large customers and the pricing they get, so it puts a little bit of margin pressure on the P&L. But again, we focus on growing dollars to drive the EPS growth. I don't know, Steve, if you have any comments."

I think one thing we try to do, if you just -- I would love to make this comment because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of.

I think one thing we try to do, if you just -- I would love to make this comment because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of. If you look at -- set aside the $3.7 billion we had in cash flow in fiscal year '15 and go to the more normalized rate we predicted, but you'll note that it's almost double our EPS growth rate, a little bit less than that. Of course, when you look at it, it's only takes about 6 days [ph] sales. However, we've done a great job of taking that cash flow and managing through the warrant hedging, which has been significant, We  over $2 billion about.  And then 2 acquisitions with our strong balance sheet that will differentiate us both in services and margins. MWI, I think was what I understood. But PharMEDium, if you look at their financial performance, it's been absolutely, for a large business, one of the most impressive growth rates I've seen since our early days of specialty. It's pretty -- their financial performance is what really, really attracted our attention and our ability that we can carry on driving significant numbers. So if you look at the job ABC is doing, we're investing in our core businesses with differentiated, complex, higher-margin services, and that cash flow is what gives us ability to do it. And we've always said our first pride is great internal projects. So for example, when I was in Heathrow this week, there's a $300,000 testing machine that they're going to buy, which will save us $300,000 a year in testing expenses, not anything we'd normally talk about, but that's a great example of why internal investments work the best for us. Our national distribution [ph] center has been an absolute home run, particularly now as we bring it into fiscal year '16. SAP, it cost us a lot more than we expected, but we couldn't have done the things we've done without it. So that's pride #1. Pride #2 is World Courier, PharMEDium and MWI. And PharMEDium, still early to pull [ph]. But MWI, I think, and World Courier, we feel terrific about the way we've been able to bring in the people, the customers and the suppliers. So I think we're doing the job that you're all paying us to do very, very well. And I just wouldn't, look, underestimate the importance of that cash flow and how it's putting into our ability to carry on managing our margins, our growth rates and invest both in internal and external projects. So I just -- I did want to make that point as we wrapped up. 
So thanks, Eric. And I'll just conclude by saying how proud we are of our performance this year. It really has been a great couple of years. We're excited about developments in the marketplace. No one can accuse our sector of being boring at all, And this is an incredibly dynamic time to be in this industry. And I'm just really proud of the way ABC is positioned, the way we're approaching customers, the way we're approaching associates. And actually, the relationship I have with our board, I should say, is another great element of our success. 
So hopefully, that this call will demonstrate both the value we're providing as well as the confidence we have in the future. Thanks for your time today. Barb, you're going to close?"
