We saw great user growth and engagement around the world especially on mobile devices, and we made nice progress on our various growth initiatives. Total revenue grew 35% for",1759,"Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone. 2014 was a strong year for TripAdvisor. We saw great user growth and engagement around the world especially on mobile devices, and we made nice progress on our various growth initiatives. Total revenue grew 35% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the year to more than $1.2 billion. Click-based advertising revenue grew 25% for both the quarter and for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $98 million for the quarter and $468 million for the year, up 88% and 23%, respectively. 
Most importantly, 2014 began the next chapter for TripAdvisor, enabling users to plan, compare and book in 3 of our largest demand categories, hotels, attractions and restaurants. Our mission is to help travelers plan and build the perfect trip, and we are investing in a number of initiatives that position us for long-term growth. Starting this quarter, we will talk about our business in 2 distinct segments: hotel and other. Our hotel segment encompasses click, display, subscription and transaction-based revenue from hotels, air, cruise, including our largest subsidiaries, SmarterTravel as well as our operations in China. Our other segment consists of attractions, restaurants and Vacation Rentals, each of which are at earlier stages of growth. Julie will cover this in our financial commentary. 
With that in mind, I'll update you on our progress in the context of what we plan to do over the next 2 years, and then I'll outline our objectives for the 3- to 5-year time frame. Over the next 2 years, our top priorities are to expand our lead in content and community and to help our travelers, not only plan their trip, but to book it as well. In terms of community, according to Google Analytics, TripAdvisor had more than 2.5 billion unique users in 2014, up approximately 25%. Needless to say, we're excited by our continued traffic growth especially at our size. 
And our community continues to engage and contribute more content. We've clicked 200 million reviews in and opinions. We're growing content at more than 125 contributions per minute in 28 different languages, and we nearly tripled non-English content over the past 2 years. Our clients are also engaging with us in more ways with approximately 25% of registered property owners responding to a user review in 2014, and more and more independent owners, as well as a big hotel chains, are using TripAdvisor tools to make review collection a systematic part of their post-stay [ph] communications. More than 1.6 million listings of places to stay, including 915,000 hotels and 650,000 Vacation Rentals as well as 2.4 million restaurants and 500,000 attractions, TripAdvisor remains the preeminent brand in travel and leisure. 
Content and community are the lifeblood of our brand, and in 2015, we plan to continue to aggressively grow these assets. Our engaged audience has a very high purchase intent, and we are making the TripAdvisor platform more valuable for users and advertisers. Consider that in a recent comScore study, over 40% of online hotel bookers in 9 of our top markets visited TripAdvisor at some point prior to booking. Through Instant Booking, we aim to monetize a greater percentage of these transactions by becoming a convenient place to compare prices and then book. Just this week, we rolled out Instant Booking to more U.S. desktop and tablet users and launched the feature to a small percentage of U.K. phone users. 
On the partner side, we've been making nice progress as well as we recently signed top hotel brands of core and Carlson. We signed 43 partners in total, 12 that are live and are empowering bookings and 31 that are being implemented. In Q4, we launched an Instant Booking beta on TripConnect, giving independent hotel users direct access to TripAdvisor's global hotel demand. Early results have been positive and some partners have noted that Instant Booking has quickly become one of their most effective marketing channels. 
Complementing our Instant Booking initiative, we recently added a plan, compare and book message to our online and off-line channels. This includes TV, an area where we plan to double our investment in 2015 to approximately $60 million. We see television as an important way to get our new plan, compare book  message out to our global audience. 
We have our other partner initiatives that have made nice progress during 2014. First, we have improved our ability to demonstrate a strong ROI for partners will through business listings. We now have more than 81,000 subscribers and have aligned pricing to more directly track the booking value that our partner sees on our platform. Moving forward, we see business listings playing into a more holistic hotel client relationship. This evolving relationship over the next couple of years will likely include products built on top of our data management platform, which is driving scalable, real-time insights so that partners can deliver the right message to the right user at just the right time. We're already seeing great early benefits in our display business where we have maintained high CPMs across more than 2,000 advertisers in all major travel categories. We also can leverage these insights into our personalization and mobile monetization initiatives. 
Finally, in mobile, we continue to expand our lead in terms of adoption and engagement on these devices. Nearly 50% of users visited TripAdvisor via tablet and phone in 2014, and our apps have been downloaded nearly 175 million times. This includes more than 155 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app, which has been growing organically at triple digit rates for the last 6 quarters. We achieved small but steady monetization improvements on the phone over the past couple of years. We believe Instant Booking can be a game changer here. 
Next, let's talk about our strategy over the 3- to 5-year time frame. While our past, present and future remain deeply rooted in the hotel category, over the next 3 to 5 years, we want to help more users find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals and establish our leadership position in these categories. In attractions, Viator announced it will soon augment its curated model with an open marketplace. This will allow Viator to rapidly grow its product portfolio, giving users better choice and driving higher conversion to bookings. We're very pleased with our integration, and since closing with them in August, we more than doubled Viator's bookings from the TripAdvisor platform. 
In restaurants, we've been very busy since we announced our LaFourchette acquisition in May. We acquired 3 more businesses in Q4, My Table and [indiscernible] in Italy and Eames in the Netherlands. In addition to these markets TripAdvisor's bookable restaurant inventory now spans France, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Sweden and Denmark, reinforcing our leadership position in Europe. We rebranded our restaurant platform as The Fork, and we've seen 4x as many restaurant bookings from TripAdvisor. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we're investing to significantly expand the fourth witch with the new and existing markets. 
In Vacation Rentals, we continue to successfully scale our free-to-list transaction model. In 2014, we drove more inventory, more travel inquiries, more bookings and strong revenue growth. At the end of Q4, we have more than 650,000 vacation rental listings driven by 73% listings growth in our free-to-list business. Free-to-list bookings grew 130% in Q4 and more than 280% for the full year, and we see this becoming more than 50% for our Vacation Rentals revenue in 2015. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on listings growth, owner engagement, user awareness and product enhancements to drive higher customer satisfaction and more transactions on our platform. 
Finally, let me briefly touch upon some of our other long-term objectives. As the world's largest travel site, we gather information about traveler preferences and activities at phenomenally large scale. It's hard to predict all of the possibilities that this scale presents, but we want to make sure that we are always exploring with the next generation of travel planning features, products and services might and how our scale can deliver benefits that nobody else can even dream of. Personalization is one such feature. Currently, we are personalizing millions of hotel shopper sessions per week, and users are engaging, clicking more and contributing more revenue per session. The beauty of this feature is not just the design and code that created it, but rather the machine learning that takes place over a multi-year time frame, driving a better set of travel advice and answers for every subsequent user. Over time, we want to be every user's personal travel guide, whether someone is looking for a place to stay or a place to eat or something to do while on their trip. Today, we're only scratching the surface of what's possible. 
Another long-term initiative is becoming a top player in China. As the largest market for outbound travel expenditures, China is a huge opportunity for everyone. What differentiates TripAdvisor in this incredibly competitive market is that we bring a full range of travel content for your entire trip, not just a place to stay. During this past Q, we broaden our suite of travel products tailor-made for Chinese travelers and have seen a growing demand for our international content. It is still very early days when it comes to tapping into the outbound Chinese travel market, which is why our China business remains squarely in investment mode. 
As you've just heard, 2014 was a year of great progress along with our major initiatives and were at the early stages of many large and exciting growth opportunities. This month celebrates our 15-year anniversary, and I can tell you that there's never been a more exciting time for TripAdvisor. We continue to operate a massive and growing business at speed, staying focused on what's best for users, what's best for partners and what's best for our business over the long term. 
Before I conclude, a reminder again about our investment philosophy as we pursue our growth plans. At 1.3 trillion in travel bookings, the global online travel market is large, lucrative and increasingly competitive. We prioritize top line growth, market share gains and EBITDA dollar growth, and we'll continue to reinvest profit when we see large opportunities in front of us. 
Finally, I want to thank all TripAdvisor employees around the globe. Your hard work delivered these great results, and you remain our largest asset as we build a bigger and better business. It was a great 2014, and I'm excited about where we're headed. I'll now turn the call over to Julie."
140233,281130170,760198,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter and year. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 35% and 39% on a constant currency basis, driven by our large and growing click-based business as well as the full quarter contribution fr",1342,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter and year. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 35% and 39% on a constant currency basis, driven by our large and growing click-based business as well as the full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. Q4 click-based revenue grew 25% or 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by 23% hotel shopper growth and solid CPC pricing for our high-value needs. Full year click-based revenue growth of 25% was driven by 17% hotel shopper growth and an easing pricing comparison due to our 2013 metasearch transition. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was positive 3% for the fourth quarter and positive 7% for the full year, a nice recovery from our negative 9% and negative 13% results in the comparable period last year. As Steve noted, we continue to lead on mobile, and I'll add that just over 2/3 of our traffic growth came on the phone, which monetizes at a lower rate than desktop and tablet and continues to be a headwind. 
Display-based revenue growth finished 2014 on a very solid note, growing 13% in the fourth quarter despite a tougher comp. Full year 2014 display revenue grew 18%, fueled by more page views as shifts in our client mix to a more attractive always on spend cadence and bolstered by our ad tech improvements that have increased marketers' ability to target. We maintain our premium position in the travel ad marketplace, and our 2014 performance compares very favorably to the declines posted by many other CPM-based businesses.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 97% for the quarter and 82% for the year. In addition to the full quarter contributions from LaFourchette and Viator, the primary drivers were value-based pricing and Business Listings and increased traffic, inventory and transactions in attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. 
Specific to geographic mix, our U.S. and U.K. markets remain strong, and we continue to see a gradual shift in a mix towards international markets. Most recently, we've seen a nice return to growth in LatAm where we've made progress working with large regional OTAs in that market. International revenue or revenue to sites other than .com increased slightly as a percentage of total growth based on hotel shopper and CPC growth globally as well as strong performance of our display and Business Listing's products overseas. As a result, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, up 88% or 98% on a constant currency basis versus negative 19% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to the high concentration of television advertising in Q4 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% for the quarter and deleveraged 2 percentage points to 38% for the full year, primarily due to ongoing investments to gain market share in our attraction and restaurant businesses, which are operating at earlier stages of their growth cycle. 
Steve mentioned our new segment breakout, which we believe provides us and investors with better information to assess overall business performance. We have provided historical revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each segment in our Q4 earnings press release. Hotel segment revenue was accelerated to 26% with very solid 42% adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year. Our other reportable segment consists of attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These businesses are all in investment mode. Other segment revenue grew 141% in 2014, driven by continued strong growth in Vacation Rentals and our LaFourchette and Viator acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was negative 4% as we absorbed our attraction and restaurant businesses' cost structures and began to fund international expansion and top line growth initiatives in these categories. We believe we are striking an appropriate balance between growth and profitability today believe that we could start to see adjusted EBITDA margin improvements in the segment as a these businesses achieve global scale. 
Moving on to headcount, we ended the year with nearly 2,800 employees, up 38%, driven by acquisitions and our investments in attracting and retaining top tier talent to pursue our growth initiatives. 
Our full year 2014 GAAP effective tax rate was nearly 30%, which is higher than our annual expectation due to certain discrete items. Our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate is 27% to 28% and is dependent on jurisdictional revenue and expenses, among other factors. We ended 2014 with 146 million diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances. 
CapEx for the quarter was $26 million or 9% of revenue. Full year CapEx was $81 million or 7% of revenue. Capitalized engineering salaries represented roughly 1/2 of our full year CapEx, while the remainder was driven by leasehold improvements to support our global growth and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. In 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $62 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and $387 million for the full year or 31% of revenue. The fourth quarter exhibited typical seasonality from our transaction businesses, Vacation Rentals, Viator, Tingo and Jetsetter in which stays are encouraged and tickets are used more in the third quarter summer travel season as opposed to the fourth quarter. We delivered $306 million of free cash flow this year or 25% of revenue. 
From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities decreased $76 million during the year to $594 million, driven primarily by free cash flow, offset by the $331 million that we allocated for acquisitions net of cash acquired. We entered 2015 with just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $300 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million. 
With that, let me provide our thoughts for 2015, a year in which we will continue to invest and build our platform to better serve more users and more partners. Note that we have changed how we provide guidance in light of the additional segments disclosure. 
We expect full year total revenue growth in the high 20s based on continued broad growth across our product set, including a full year benefit from our attractions and restaurant acquisitions, offset by lapping the benefits from our metasearch transition, the ongoing shift of our traffic to mobile and international as well as the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We will not be providing our traditional product guidance moving forward. Our move towards more holistic partner relationships may eventually include solution selling and bundling of our CPC, Instant Booking, display and business listings, potentially causing the lines between those products to blur. This potential evolution would make it difficult to provide a specific outlook for our traditional product breakout. 
On the expense side, we are expecting slight deleverage on the cost of sales line from our Viator acquisition. We expect sales and marketing expense to delever as a percentage of revenue due to increased investment in our television ad campaign as well as international expansion in our attraction and restaurant businesses. As our segment disclosure implies, other segment revenue ids growing well in excess of enterprise revenue growth rates, and we're trading off near-term profits for top line growth in market share gains in those categories. 
Growing it, we expect 2015 EBITDA growth in the low to midteens. Using 2014 exchange rates, our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth expectation would have been approximately 3 and 5 percentage points higher, respectively. Finally, we expect stock-based compensation, as well as depreciation and amortization, to be roughly in line with 2014 levels or approximately 5% of revenue. 
In summary, Q4 was a great ending to a strong year. We expanded TripAdvisor's reach within travel planning and trip taking and pursued our goals to make the TripAdvisor platform even more valuable for users and advertising partners alike. We will now open the call to your questions."

First, just when we look at the footprint of the hotels that have an instant book option, within a slice of traffic exposed to it, it looks like a pretty good penetration already partially driven by what look like small OTAs. Curious if you could just give us some color on some of the reasons why you've been expanding that slice of traffic exposed to this so slowly, and maybe is this an issue just to make sure customers are happy, is it a monetization issue. Some color on that would be great. And then as a follow-up to that, you talked a lot about the fact that TripAdvisor are driving a lot of bookings that your OTA customers may not give you full credit for when they measure ROI, and this is something instant book gap that can be close to better attribution. Wondering if you could just kind of give us some color on how you think you're kind of plugging that leakage in early tests of instant book.

So you're right, we have a pretty good footprint when we look at U.S. traveler demand via our partnerships with several OTAs. There's a couple of caveats on the overall rollout. We always look at a bunch of different factors, is the pricing as good or better than what other meta options are, where the instant book is placed on the screen, the OTA through partners themselves, how well they're able to fulfill the transaction and, finally, the margin. When we look at the current rollout and we've actually just increased the rollout this week in the U.S., we think of it as a steady march forward. We've got a lot that we need to get right because we're fundamentally responsible for a chunk of this transaction now as opposed to just the meta lead. So as we move forward, we want more suppliers. We're looking for a broader set of OTA adoption if we can get it, but in general, there wasn't a strict rollout plan, but we're pleased with how it's been moving. In terms of the plugging the leak notion, one of the things we're able to do with this level of rollout is measure the repeat visit effect of the folks who are seeing Instant Booking versus the folks who currently only see meta on desktop in particular. And in that case, what we've seen is a modest uptick in how folks are coming back because of -- coming back directly to TripAdvisor because of that Instant Booking interaction. It's modest at this point. We're looking at all different ways that we're able to both improve the conversion of instant book as well as reinforce the message that TripAdvisor is a great place, not only to research your stay, but to really come back, make sure you're getting the best price and then finish the booking. So some of that is messaging, and that just takes time. Some of that is the actual Instant Book rollout itself, the product feature, but all of it focuses around where the question came from, which is that effort on our part that started last year and will take place this year and beyond to plug the leak and interestingly a fair credit for all the transactions that were driving but get lost in the online attribution shuffle."

Good question. so we do have a good size salesforces with the Viator acquisition, LaFourchette and the companies that we've acquired since. So you can tell specifically in restaurants that we're not shy about acquiring supply and, in some cases, supply plus demand in newer markets. We have a long history of acquisitions in a lot of different categories. Restaurants, attractions have no reason to be exceptions. But you've also noted that, from my remarks, we're expanding in Turkey, in Sweden, in Denmark, in Belgium, and those aren't through acquisitions. Those are through organic growth, and it's not that there aren't potentially companies to be acquired, but with each country, we make a decision, we look forward and we say there's a trade-off of integration versus organic growth. We're serious about the space. We'll building out the restaurant-specific salesforce that's not shared with attractions or hotels because they're calling on different customers, but it is getting to be a decent size and, certainly, continues to grow. Attractions, we bought the clear market leader, the biggest most global player in the space today, near as we can tell, far and away, bigger than the competitive set. That's not to say, we'd be ruling out other acquisitions or additional supply and/or demand in various markets. As I said, with restaurants, we have a history of doing that. But in no way shape or form, should anyone view it as a requirement for our successful -- for us being successful in restaurants because, frankly, we looked at the TripAdvisor points of sale in each country and say, in so many parts of the world, we are already where travelers are going to figure out what they want to do when they get there. And so now it's just a question of plugging in Viator's curated product and, going forward, Viator's marketplace product, which will dramatically expand the number of product online, matching it to the demand that the TripAdvisor already has. And so country by country, we pick up supplying in both restaurants and attractions."

You go straight to the traveler lifestyle apps that you're looking for and then ask for something near where you are because all of the apps in our vertical have high-quality near me now functionality. So I don't really think of it as if the question was along the lines of hey, and on a Google or an Apple map, is that going to be the starting point for finding a great place to eat. I think that's a pretty far shift for the consumer to make versus starting with a restaurant app or a travel app or something tailored for that purchase. In terms of better selling ROI, if this is in reference to business listings, what we've been moving on quite aggressively in 2014, especially the back half, has been better explaining the return on investment that we've been able to quantify for quite a large number of hotel chains and independents. So by this, I mean we count the number of clicks, we count the number of phone calls that shows travelers going from our website directly to the hotel's website, and then where we're able to, we measure the actual transactions that happen and then we walk it backwards and say, what's the return on investment for a business listing subscription. We model it where we don't have exact tracking, but the modeling frequently comes out as a 5:1 return, a 10:1 return or a 20:1 return on this investment. What we try to do in our pricing is align the pricing to where that return is so that it's not underpriced, it's not overpriced but it's a fair deal, it's a good deal for every hotelier that's looking to capture some of the demand that's sitting on TripAdvisor today. And that's, in part, some of our upticks in our TripAdvisor for business, and business listings product is finding the better price that matches the value delivered. And the final point, Instant Book pricing it's a commission model. As you're aware, as we rolled it out to independent properties and then connect data, there has been 2 price points offered, a 12% commission and a 15% commission. We have properties, not surprisingly that tare taking us up on both of those. The higher commission is a little hard to say will pick your commission, but when a hotelier picks a higher commission, we guarantee that they will be shown more frequently than anyone else in the Instant Book option. So hoteliers looking to take control of their own demand, looking to drive more bookings directly through themselves find that quite an attractive offering, and again, it's in beta. It's just coming up now. It's rolling out slowly. We've got a lot of opportunities to scale globally, but we're taking it with a measured approach to make sure it works for all the hoteliers that are signing up."

So first off, I'd urge you to think about the vast, vast majority of the properties on TripAdvisor are independents and they don't even know Instant Booking exists because it is not yet available for them to connect to. So tapping into that big marketplace is a fantastic opportunity that's still ahead of us that we're still in beta in. That's the independents. The chains look at it as, obviously, there's more than a handful that says, sounds good, sign me up and in the implementation phase. I'd say we're in interesting discussions with every chain that we have spoken with. So there's perhaps hesitation on timing, there's perhaps question marks on where this fits in the hotel's priority list and then there's a discussion on commission. So every hotel would naturally prefer to take a booking directly on their own website but would present a wonderful balance between we have a tremendous amount of traffic. That traffic is going to be on TripAdvisor and grow on TripAdvisor, we hope the foreseeable future, folks looking to figure out where they want to stay that aren't yet brand loyal, and our offering to the chains has helped take this booking directly through our Instant Book in an affordable manner and use the hotel chain, now have the opportunity to woo the independent traveler to become a brand loyal traveler. I wouldn't say -- I mean as i said before, hasn't grown as quickly as we have initially hoped, but I find the conversations with the hotel chains productive, positive, and each time, we're chatting on our quarterly calls we have more than we have signed up."

When we look at what it actually takes, it's a contact, it's a sales pitch, it's a commission negotiation and then it's a -- into the development queue, which each company treats quite differently, a testing process and rollout. So as we say, the number of signed partners is greater than the number of live partners. Those folks are all in various points of this implementation. I can't point to any specific item other than commission conversation that is a blocker in our discussions with the hotel chains, but every hotel chain, rightfully so, is looking to address their overall distribution costs. TripAdvisor comes in, and it can be an effective way to grow their direct bookings, but it's still a distribution cost that hotel chains need to fully understand. There's a piece of the sales cycle that we recognize that we perhaps didn't fully appreciate a year ago. We're not an OTA and we're not pure media with our Instant Book. We're not an OTA because we're not taking the booking, we're not charging the credit card, we're not providing support, but we're not pure media because, actually, the consumer is doing the booking while they're still on the TripAdvisor page, and we're sending all the consumer information direct to the hotel so that they're charging the credit card, they're providing the support. So it's a model that they haven't seen before, and there's a bit of, well, how do we, the hotel chain model, this out, how do we make sure it's not cannibalistic to our participation in meta, and we have lots of sales materials. I think our sales job, our sales team is doing a pretty good job going through it, but I admit it's taking us longer than we expect. I couldn't name 3 things to do to clearly speed the cycle that I'd be willing to do. So again, progress every quarter, but no silver bullet there."

TV is a fabulous way to do that quickly. You've seen some of the branding chains on the site. But when compare and book helps from a positioning perspective full travelers back to TripAdvisor, maybe after they selected the hotel they want and now they need to compare prices. And hey, some books don't realize that TripAdvisor is the best that's out there to do that, and hey, there's an educational component. We're not moving -- to be clear, we're not moving away from our core assets in reviews and communities, but we do want to extend our brand value proposition to include price comparison so you can find the best price and the convenience of booking it once you found that great price. So you have some deleverage that you can point to TV on. Then as we're dramatically growing the other component of the business, we kind of look at it as, hey, how does -- how would we, as stewards of this company, look at the opportunity in the attractions category. And we'd say, wow, fantastic. Could turn it profitable tomorrow, if we wanted to, but why would we choose to do that when the growth opportunity is so tremendous. I mean we feel so optimistic about this category because it's so big and we're the ones that can bring the demand and the supply together. We just need more inventory. With more inventory, we can both grow our organic demand by more demand, and then we become known as the aggregator of, hey, what do I want to do when I get there, and that feeds upon itself. We get more supply, we get more demand, bingo, and we not only retain our current leadership position in that category, we'll become unassailable over years. And then, as with any business like this, margins flow really nicely out of it because as traffic builds, especially if it's repeat traffic or organically grown traffic or app traffic, customer acquisition is new and you've got a beautiful margin machine here because it may not be hotel level margins but you have a very nice margin structure in the attractions biz. In restaurants, again, proven example, OpenTable's a company out there, terrific margins, a strong team, amazing supply in the U.S. and its greenfield in so many other countries, and we are expanding in a number of those other countries, but the different model, a different value proposition in part but just the same to us, a proven space that we are a leader in, in several countries, looking to expand. So again, a great opportunity to grow and secure that leadership. When we look at Vacation Rentals, there's a couple of other unique players in there, which have clearly proven that the market size is large. We have our own set of demand. We made that transition to free-to-list really nicely. As we indicated, a majority of our business on the transaction model that we think is a better model than a pure subscription one, mostly through that transition and continues to be a strong grower for us. So again, really nice opportunity. What we tried to do with some of the -- with the segment reporting is to give you some visibility into, hey, and how the management team do we sit around and balance the investing in the core hotel versus where we see the growth vehicles. And you can see the breakout, then with the growth vehicles, we could be pulling profits but we're choosing to reinvest in growth because from our perspective, it's not a question of if the markets are there or if the markets are big enough. It's a clear answer yes, the markets are there, yes, the markets are big, yes we have either an existing leadership position or have a strong growth position in that market so the opportunity is clearly worth chasing ergo investment philosophy that we have for that segment."

All the various channels are bringing more demand to the site. We don't, we don't -- we can't talk about the overall growth. I remind you that on the TV campaign, even though 60 million is a pretty big number, we deal in a lot of markets with a lot of amazing sort of hotel shopper numbers such that the TV campaign will have an impact in hotel shopper growth, but it's kind of -- it's not one of those that we would expect to have like tremendous impact purely because of the scale at which we operate. As to sort of comps and this and that versus 2015, sorry, it's hard for us to predict. The core meta option on CPC pricing, we predict our remodel, I should say, a seasonally adjusted, neutral CPC. So it's not to say CPCs don't go up and down over the course of the year. But when we look at this year versus a view into last year without meta, I mean without the how taking into account the lapping from the year before, we don't assume -- let me just start again. We don't assume that the auction dynamics will drive up or down at CPC pricing going forward. So the mix will shift a bit too international this year unlike last year, we have a little bit of an overhang. Mobile traffic will continue to grow, mobile revenue will continue to grow. That has a lower average CPC than desktop, so that's a bit kind of a headwind if we're going to average all of the CPCs. But when we do our modeling, we model first desktop and then mobile and add them together. And so the core question of hey, are we counting on auction trends pushing CPCs up or down. The answer is no to both. Yes, I mean I'm not sure that there are big opportunities out there in auction land for the CPC in travel to go up a lot. So the auction has been running for many, many years, and I think the big players have mastered the techniques of running in our auction. So I'd be surprised if there was, all of a sudden, a big uptick. I wouldn't be able to explain it."

So mobile, when will it stop become a tailwind. I guess I have a bit of a split personality on mobile because the hotel traffic, the shoppers are moving to mobile, but we have the best mobile product out there for planning a trip, and the downloads are showing that, the ranking is showing that, and everything every data point that we can find says people are using the TripAdvisor mobile experience more than any other travel product. Therefore, we love the adoption. Consumers are liking it, but they don't monetize as well clearly. So are they using it to do their research and then popping back to the desktop to finish their transaction on TripAdvisor or are they using it, are they using the phone app and then popping over to somewhere else to finish buying something. With our Instant Book initiative, and the fact that the app is so much more comprehensive than the alternatives, we feel that as people continue to use the app on the trip, they get stickier and stickier with our experience. We introduced Instant Book. It makes that purchase relatively seamless. We're not fulfilling it. It's an OTA or a supplier or brand.com or whatever, but the convenience of doing that all-in-one app, the same app that helped you find the restaurant, the same app that helped you plan out your day, the app that's given you your map to get from where you're standing to where you're eating or where your hotel is, that's all part of the experience that's part of what makes that TripAdvisor planning, that TripAdvisor on the go something that sticks with you. Therefore, if it sticks with you, you're going to come back and use TripAdvisor the next time. So the app monetizes better than the mobile web for us. We make continuous improvements in how all of that functions. And if we can do a good job of tying mobile together with the booking piece, we feel we'll be able to both improve monetization of the app as well as get folks ready to continue to use TripAdvisor for all of their experiences. And when I compare that scenario to a Google or some of the other travel sites, it's just not at -- we have something that's more complete, more full life cycle and, therefore, deserves, by way of functionality, to be stickier. There was a second part of the question. So the Instant Booking experience. Yes, clearly in our view, much better than the meta click-off experience, and we're still in the early days there. We want to present enough information in that TripAdvisor flow to make the traveler completely comfortable that they're getting the best price, they're getting a great room selection, they're getting all of the support signals that they need in order to know it's the right hotel at the right price, right location, right everything to finish booking, and other companies have had years and years of experience in that part of the transaction. We haven't, and so we continue to improve. And I tell you, the team's done a really nice job over the past 6-plus months improving that transaction flow, improving experience, giving folks what they're looking for, and we know that because we see the conversion rate continually improve month over month over month. In terms of the mobile app experience, I just love it. It's hands-down better than meta. I can't recall seeing any feedback that says I prefer the meta experience over the Instant Book. So we got a winner there. It's still subject to people being comfortable booking the leisure trip on their phone, but our partners that have been -- our Instant Book partners are saying terrific, love the bookings, love the experience, and they call it a direct booking and that's part of the name of the game for them is to be able to get more of those bookings. So no real concern about Instant Book being a problematic user experience. We just need to make it better and better in order to improve the conversion on our site."

In terms of community, according to Google Analytics, TripAdvisor had more than 2.5 billion unique users in 2014, up approximately 25%. Needless to say, we're excited by our continued traffic growth especially at our size.
And our community continues to engage and contribute more content. We eclipsed 200 million reviews and opinions. We're growing content at more than 125 contributions per minute in 28 different languages, and we nearly tripled non-English content over the past 2 years. Our clients are also engaging with us in more ways, with approximately 25% of registered property owners responding to a user review in 2014, and more and more independent owners, as well as a big hotel chains, are using TripAdvisor tools to make review collection a systematic part of their post-stay communications. With more than 1.6 million listings of places to stay, including 915,000 hotels and 650,000 vacation rentals, as well as 2.4 million restaurants and 500,000 attractions, TripAdvisor remains the preeminent brand in travel and leisure.
Content and community are the lifeblood of our brand. And in 2015, we plan to continue to aggressively grow these assets. Our engaged audience has a very high purchase intent, and we are making the TripAdvisor platform more valuable for users and advertisers. Consider that in a recent comScore study, over 40% of online hotel bookers in 9 of our top markets visited TripAdvisor at some point prior to booking. Through Instant Booking, we aim to monetize a greater percentage of these transactions by becoming a convenient place to compare prices and then book. Just this week, we rolled out Instant Booking to more U.S. desktop and tablet users and launched the feature to a small percentage of U.K. phone users.
On the partner side, we've been making nice progress as well, as we recently signed top hotel brands Accor and Carlson. We signed 43 partners in total, 12 that are live and are powering bookings and 31 that are being implemented. In Q4, we launched an Instant Booking beta on TripConnect, giving independent hoteliers direct access to TripAdvisor's global hotel demand. Early results have been positive and some partners have noted that Instant Booking has quickly become one of their most effective marketing channels.
Complementing our Instant Booking initiative, we recently added a ""plan, compare and book"" message to our online and offline channels. This includes TV, an area where we plan to double our investment in 2015 to approximately $60 million. We see television as an important way to get our new ""plan, compare and book"" message out to our global audience.
We have our other partner initiatives that have made nice progress during 2014. First, we have improved our ability to demonstrate the strong ROI for partners through Business Listings. We now have more than 81,000 subscribers and have aligned pricing to more directly track the booking value that a partner sees on our platform. Moving forward, we see Business Listings playing into a more holistic hotel client relationship. This evolving relationship over the next couple of years will likely include products built on top of our data management platform, which is driving scalable, real-time insights so that partners can deliver the right message to the right user at just the right time. We're already seeing great, early benefits in our display business, where we have maintained high CPMs across more than 2,000 advertisers in all major travel categories. We also can leverage these insights into our personalization and mobile monetization initiatives.
Finally, in mobile, we continue to expand our lead in terms of adoption and engagement on these devices. Nearly 50% of users visited TripAdvisor via tablet and phone in 2014, and our apps have been downloaded nearly 175 million times. This includes more than 155 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app, which has been growing organically at triple-digit rates for the last 6 quarters. We've achieved small but steady monetization improvements on the phone over the past couple of years. We believe Instant Booking can be a game changer here.
Next, let's talk about our strategy over the 3- to 5-year time frame. While our past, present and future remain deeply rooted in the hotel category, over the next 3 to 5 years, we want to help more users find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals and establish our leadership position in these categories. In attractions, Viator announced it will soon augment its curated model with an open marketplace. This will allow Viator to rapidly grow its product portfolio, giving users better choice and driving higher conversion to bookings. We're very pleased with our integration. And since closing the deal in August, we've more than doubled Viator's bookings from the TripAdvisor platform.
In restaurants, we've been very busy since we announced our LaFourchette acquisition in May. We acquired 3 more businesses in Q4, mytable and restopolis in Italy and Iens in The Netherlands. In addition to these markets, TripAdvisor's bookable restaurant inventory now spans France, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Sweden and Denmark, reinforcing our leadership position in Europe. We rebranded our restaurant platform as TheFork, and we're sending 4x as many restaurant bookings from TripAdvisor. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we're investing to significantly expand TheFork's reach within new and existing markets.
In Vacation Rentals, we continue to successfully scale our free-to-list transaction model. In 2014, we drove more inventory, more traveler inquiries, more bookings and strong revenue growth. At the end of Q4, we had more than 650,000 vacation rental listings driven by 73% listings growth in our free-to-list business. Free-to-list bookings grew 130% in Q4 and more than 280% for the full year, and we see this becoming more than 50% for our Vacation Rentals revenue in 2015. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on listings growth, owner engagement, user awareness and product enhancements to drive higher customer satisfaction and more transactions on our platform.
Finally, let me briefly touch upon some of our other long-term objectives. As the world's largest travel site, we gather information about traveler preferences and activities at phenomenally large scale. It's hard to predict all of the possibilities that this scale presents, but we want to make sure that we are always exploring what the next generation of travel planning features, products and services might and how our scale can deliver benefits that nobody else can even dream of. Personalization is one such feature. Currently, we are personalizing millions of hotel shopper sessions per week, and users are engaging, clicking more and contributing more revenue per session. The beauty of this feature is not just the design and code that created it, but rather the machine learning that takes place over a multiyear time frame, driving a better set of travel advice and answers for every subsequent user. Over time, we want to be every user's personal travel guide, whether someone is looking for a place to stay, a place to eat or something to do while on their trip. Today, we are only scratching the surface of what's possible.
Another long-term initiative is becoming a top player in China. As the largest market for outbound travel expenditures, China is a huge opportunity for everyone. What differentiates TripAdvisor in this incredibly competitive market is that we bring the full range of travel content for your entire trip, not just a place to stay. During this past year, we broadened our suite of travel products tailor-made for Chinese travelers and have seen the growing demand for our international content. It is still very early days when it comes to tapping into the outbound Chinese traveler market, which is why our China business remains squarely in investment mode.
As you've just heard, 2014 was a year of great progress along our major initiatives, and we're at the early stages of many large and exciting growth opportunities. This month celebrates our 15-year anniversary, and I can tell you that there's never been a more exciting time for TripAdvisor. We continue to operate a massive and growing business at speed, staying focused on what's best for users, what's best for partners and what's best for our business over the long term.
Before I conclude, a reminder again about our investment philosophy as we pursue our growth plans. At $1.3 trillion in travel bookings, the global online travel market is large, lucrative and increasingly competitive. We prioritize top line growth, market share gains and EBITDA dollar growth, and we'll continue to reinvest profit when we see large opportunities in front of us.
Finally, I want to thank all TripAdvisor employees around the globe. Your hard work delivered these great results, and you remain our largest asset as we build a bigger and better business. It was a great 2014, and I'm excited about where we're headed.
I'll now turn the call over to Julie."

We had a great quarter and year. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 35% and 39% on a constant currency basis, driven by our large and growing click-based business, as well as a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. Q4 click-based revenue grew 25% or 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by 23% hotel shopper growth and solid CPC pricing for our high-value leads. Full year click-based revenue growth of 25% was driven by 17% hotel shopper growth and an easing pricing comparison due to our 2013 metasearch transition. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was positive 3% for the fourth quarter and positive 7% for the full year, a nice recovery from our negative 9% and negative 13% results in the comparable periods last year. As Steve noted, we continue to lead on mobile, and I'll add that just over 2/3 of our traffic growth came on the phone, which monetizes at a lower rate than desktop and tablet and continues to be a headwind.
Display-based revenue growth finished 2014 on a very solid note, growing 13% in the fourth quarter despite a tougher comp. Full year 2014 display revenue grew 18%, fueled by more page views, a shift in our client mix to a more attractive always-on spend cadence and bolstered by our ad tech improvements that has increased the marketers' ability to target. We maintain our premium position in the travel ad marketplace, and our 2014 performance compares very favorably to the declines posted by many other CPM-based businesses.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 97% for the quarter and 82% for the year. In addition to a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator, the primary drivers were value-based pricing in Business Listing and increased traffic, inventory and transactions in attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals.
Specific to geographic mix, our U.S. and U.K. markets remain strong, and we continue to see a gradual shift in a mix towards international markets. Most recently, we've seen a nice return to growth in LatAm, where we've made progress working with large regional OTAs in that market. International revenue or revenue to sites other than .com increased slightly as a percentage of total growth based on hotel shopper and CPC growth globally, as well as strong performance of our display and Business Listing products overseas. As a result, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, up 88% or 98% on a constant currency basis versus negative 19% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to the high concentration of television advertising in Q4 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% for the quarter and deleveraged 2 percentage points to 38% for the full year, primarily due to ongoing investments to gain market share in our attraction and restaurant businesses, which are operating at earlier stages of their growth cycle.
Steve mentioned our new segment breakout, which we believe provides us and investors with better information to assess overall business performance. We have provided historical revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each segment in our Q4 earnings press release. Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 26%, with very solid 42% adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year. Our Other reportable segment consists of attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These businesses are all in investment mode. Other segment revenue grew 141% in 2014, driven by continued strong growth in Vacation Rentals and our LaFourchette and Viator acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was negative 4% as we absorbed our attraction and restaurant businesses' cost structure and began to fund international expansion and top line growth initiatives in these categories. We believe we are striking an appropriate balance between growth and profitability today and believe that we could start to see adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in this segment as these businesses achieve global scale.
Moving on to headcount, we ended the year with nearly 2,800 employees, up 38%, driven by acquisitions and our investments in attracting and retaining top-tier talent to pursue our growth initiatives.
Our full year 2014 GAAP effective tax rate was nearly 30%, which is higher than our annual expectation due to certain discrete items. Our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate is 27% to 28% and is dependent on jurisdictional revenue and expense mix, among other factors. We ended 2014 with 146 million diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances.
CapEx for the quarter was $26 million or 9% of revenue. Full year CapEx was $81 million or 7% of revenue. Capitalized engineering salaries represented roughly 1/2 of our full year CapEx, while the remainder was driven by leasehold improvements to support our global growth and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. In 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $62 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and $387 million for the full year or 31% of revenue. The fourth quarter exhibited typical seasonality from our transaction businesses, Vacation Rentals, Viator, Tingo and Jetsetter in which stays are incurred and tickets are used more in the third quarter summer travel season as opposed to the fourth quarter. We delivered $306 million of free cash flow this year or 25% of revenue.
From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities decreased $76 million during the year to $594 million, driven primarily by free cash flow, offset by the $331 million that we allocated for acquisitions net of cash acquired. We entered 2015 with just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $300 million, as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.
With that, let me provide our thoughts for 2015, a year in which we will continue to invest and build our platform to better serve more users and more partners. Note that we have changed how we provide guidance in light of the additional segment disclosure.
We expect full year total revenue growth in the high-20s based on continued broad growth across our product set, including a full year benefit from our attractions and restaurant acquisitions, offset by lapping the benefits from our metasearch transition, the ongoing shift of our traffic to mobile and international, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We will not be providing our traditional product guidance moving forward. Our move towards more holistic partner relationships may eventually include solution selling and bundling of our CPC, Instant Booking, display and Business Listings, potentially causing the lines between those products to blur. This potential evolution would make it difficult to provide a specific outlook for our traditional product breakout.
On the expense side, we are expecting slight deleverage on the cost of sales line from our Viator acquisition. We expect sales and marketing expense to delever as a percentage of revenue due to increased investment in our television ad campaign, as well as international expansion in our attraction and restaurant businesses. As our segment disclosure implies, Other segment revenue is growing well in excess of enterprise revenue growth rates, and we're trading off near-term profits for top line growth and market share gains in those categories.
Rolling it out, we expect 2015 EBITDA growth in the low to mid-teens. Using 2014 exchange rates, our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth expectations would have been approximately 3 and 5 percentage points higher, respectively. Finally, we expect stock-based compensation, as well as depreciation and amortization, to be roughly in line with 2014 levels or approximately 5% of revenue.
In summary, Q4 was a great end to a strong year. We expanded TripAdvisor's reach within travel planning and trip taking in pursuit of our goal to make the TripAdvisor platform even more valuable for users and advertising partners alike. We will now open the call to your questions."

First, just when we look at the footprint of the hotels that have an instant book option when you're within a slice of traffic that's, in fact, exposed to it, it looks like a pretty good penetration already, largely driven by what looked like small OTAs. Curious if you can just give us some color on some of the reasons why you've been expanding that slice of traffic exposed to this so slowly. And maybe, is this an issue with just making sure customers are happy, is it a monetization issue? Some color on that would be great. And then as a follow-up to that, you've talked a lot about the fact that TripAdvisor's driving a lot of bookings that your OTA customers may not give you full credit for when they measure ROI, and this is something instant book can -- a gap that can be closed through better attribution. Wondering if you can just kind of give us some color on how you think you're kind of plugging that leakage in the early tests of instant book. And then even if economics today may not be as good as they could be long term with more OTA participation, does that matter with your plugging such a big hole in leakage?"

So you're right, we have a pretty good footprint when we look at U.S. traveler demand via our partnerships with several OTAs. There's a couple of caveats on the overall rollout. We always look at a bunch of different factors. Is the pricing as good or better than what other meta options are, where the instant book is placed on the screen, the OTA sort of partners themselves, how well they're able to fulfill the transaction and then finally, the margin. When we look at the current rollout, and we've actually just increased the rollout this week in the U.S., we think of it as a steady march forward. We've got a lot that we need to get right because we're fundamentally responsible for a chunk of this transaction now as opposed to just the meta lead. So as we move forward, we want more suppliers. We're looking for a broader set of OTA adoption, if we can get it. But in general, there wasn't a strict rollout plan, but we're pleased with how it's been moving. In terms of the plugging the leak notion, one of the things we're able to do with this level of rollout is measure the repeat visit effect of the folks who are seeing Instant Booking versus the folks who currently only see meta on desktop in particular. And in that case, what we've seen is a modest uptick in how folks are coming back because of -- coming back directly to TripAdvisor because of that Instant Booking interaction. It's modest at this point. We're looking at all different ways that we're able to both improve the conversion of instant book, as well as reinforce the message that TripAdvisor is a great place, not only to research your stay, but to really come back, make sure you're getting the best price and then finish the booking. So some of that is messaging, and that just takes time. Some of that is the actual instant book rollout itself, the product feature, but all of it focuses around where the question came from, which is that effort on our part that started last year and will take place this year and beyond to plug the leak and just get fair credit for all the transactions that we're driving but get lost in the online attribution shuffle."

So we do have good sized sales forces with the Viator acquisition, LaFourchette and the companies that we've acquired since. So you can tell specifically in restaurants that we're not shy about acquiring supply and, in some cases, supply plus demand in newer markets. We have a long history of acquisitions in a lot of different categories. Restaurants and attractions have no reason to be exceptions. But you've also noted that, from my remarks, we're expanding in Turkey, in Sweden, in Denmark, in Belgium, and those aren't through acquisitions. Those are through organic growth. And it's not that there aren't potentially companies to be acquired, but with each country, we make a decision, we look forward. And we say, there's a trade-off of integration versus organic growth. We're serious about the space. We're building out the restaurant-specific sales force. That's not shared with attractions or hotels because they're calling on different customers. But it is getting to be a decent size and, certainly, continues to grow. Attractions, we bought the clear market leader, biggest, most global player in the space today. Near as we can tell, far and away, bigger than the competitive set. That's not to say, we'd be ruling out other acquisitions for additional supply and/or demand in various markets. As I said with restaurants, we have a history of doing that. But in no way shape or form should anyone view it as a requirement for our successful -- for us being successful in restaurants because, frankly, we look at the TripAdvisor points of sale in each country and say, ""In so many parts of the world, we are already where travelers are going to figure out what they want to do when they get there."" And so now it's just a question of plugging in Viator's curated product and, going forward, Viator's marketplace product, which will dramatically expand the number of products online, matching it to demand that TripAdvisor already has. And so country by country, we pick up supply in both restaurants and attractions."

We note that on various phone devices there doesn't seem to be -- or at least no one else is reporting a lot of traffic coming from integration with maps. We find the user behavior of, ""I'm looking for a nearby restaurant. I'm looking for a nearby hotel. I'm looking for something to do."" You go straight to the traveler lifestyle apps that you were looking for and then ask for something near where you are because all of the apps in our vertical have high-quality near me now functionality. So I don't really think of it as -- if the question was along the lines of, ""Hey"" -- and on a Google or an Apple map -- ""Is that going to be the starting point for finding me a great place to eat?"" I think that's a pretty far shift for the consumer to make versus starting with a restaurant app or a travel app or something tailored for that purchase. In terms of a better selling ROI, if this is in reference to Business Listings, what we've been moving on quite aggressively in 2014, especially the back half, has been better explaining the return on investment that we've been able to quantify for quite a large number of hotel chains and independents. And by this, I mean, we count the number of clicks. We count the number of phone calls that shows travelers going from our website directly to the hotel's website. And then where we're able to, we measure the actual transactions that happen. And then we walk it backwards and say, ""What's the return on investment for a Business Listing subscription?"" We model it where we don't have exact tracking, but the modeling frequently comes out at a 5:1 return, a 10:1 return or a 20:1 return on this investment. What we've tried to do in our pricing is align the pricing to where that return is so that it's not underpriced, it's not overpriced, but it's a fair deal. It's a good deal for every hotelier that's looking to capture some of the demand that's sitting on TripAdvisor today. And that's, in part, some of our upticks in our TripAdvisor for Business and Business Listings product is finding the better price that matches the value delivered. And the final point, instant book pricing, it's a commission model. As you're aware, as we've rolled it out to independent properties in the TripConnect beta, there have been 2 price points offered, a 12% commission and a 15% commission. We have properties, not surprisingly, that tare taking us up on both of those. The higher commission, it's a little odd to say, well, pick your commission, but when a hotelier picks a higher commission, we guarantee that they will be shown more frequently than anyone else in the instant book auction. So hoteliers looking to take control of their own demand, looking to drive more bookings directly through themselves find that quite an attractive offering. And again, it's in beta. It's just coming out now. It's rolling out slowly. We've got a lot of opportunities to scale globally, but we're taking it with a measured approach to make sure it works for all the hoteliers that are signing up."

So every hotel would naturally prefer to take a booking directly on their own website, but we present a wonderful balance between -- we have a tremendous amount of traffic. That traffic is going to be on TripAdvisor and grow on TripAdvisor, we hope, in the foreseeable future. Folks looking to figure out where they want to stay that aren't yet brand loyal. And our offering to the chains is, help take this booking directly through our instant book in an affordable manner and the hotel chain now has the opportunity to woo that independent traveler to become a brand loyal traveler. I wouldn't say -- I mean, as I said before, hasn't gone as quickly as we had initially hoped, but I find the conversations with the hotel chains productive, positive. And each time we're chatting on quarterly calls, we have more that we have signed up."

So the sales cycle has been certainly longer than we had hoped, but the hotels have -- hotel chains have an awful lot on their plate these days. When we look at what it actually takes. It's a contact. It's a sales pitch. It's a commission negotiation. And then it's a -- into the development queue, which each company treats quite differently, a testing process and a rollout. So as we say, the number of signed partners is greater than the number of live partners. Those folks are all in various points of the implementation. I can't point to any specific item other than commission conversation that is a blocker in our discussions with the hotel chains. But every hotel chain, rightfully so, is looking to address their overall distribution costs. TripAdvisor comes in, and it can be an effective way to grow their direct bookings, but it's still a distribution cost that hotel chains need to fully understand. There's a piece of the sales cycle that we recognize that we perhaps didn't fully appreciate a year ago. We're not an OTA and we're not pure media with our instant book. We're not an OTA because we're not taking the booking, we're not charging the credit card, we're not providing support. But we're not pure media because, actually, the consumer is doing the booking while they're still on a TripAdvisor page. And we're sending all of the consumer information direct to the hotel so that they're charging the credit card, they're providing the support. So it's a model that they haven't seen before, and there's a bit of, ""Well, how do we, the hotel chain, model this out? How do we make sure it's not cannibalistic to our participation in meta?"" And we have lots of sales materials. I think our sales job -- our sales team is doing a pretty good job going through it. But I admit, has been taking us longer than we expect. I couldn't name 3 things to do to clearly speed the cycle that I'd be willing to do. So again, progress every quarter, but no silver bullet there."

TV is a fabulous way to do that quickly. You've seen some of the branding change on the site. The ""plan, compare and book"" helps from a positioning perspective pull travelers back to TripAdvisor maybe after they've selected the hotel they want and now they need to compare prices. And hey, some folks don't realize that TripAdvisor is the best source out there to do that. And hey, there's an educational component. We're not moving -- to be clear, we're not moving away from our core asset in reviews and communities, but we do want to extend our brand value proposition to include price comparison so you can find the best price and the convenience of booking it once you found that great price. So you have some deleverage that you can point to TV on. Then as we're dramatically growing the other component of the business, we tend to look at it as, ""Hey, how does -- how would we, as stewards of this company, look at the opportunity in the attractions category?"" And we say, ""Wow, fantastic. Could turn it profitable tomorrow by a lot, if we wanted to."" But why would we choose to do that when the growth opportunity is so tremendous? I mean, we feel so optimistic about this category because it's so big and we're the ones that can bring the demand and the supply together. We just need more inventory. With more inventory, we can both grow our organic demand by more demand, and then we become known as the aggregator of, hey, what do I want to do when I get there? And that feeds upon itself. We get more supply. We get more demand. Bingo. And we not only retain our current leadership position in that category, but we become unassailable over years. And then, as with any business like this, margins flow really nicely out of it because as traffic builds, especially if it's repeat traffic or organically grown traffic or app traffic, customer acquisition is nil and you've got a beautiful margin machine here because it may not be hotel-level margins, but you have a very nice margin structure in the attractions biz. In restaurants, again, proven example, OpenTable is a remarkable company out there. Terrific margins, a strong team, amazing supply in the U.S. and it's greenfield in so many other countries. And we are expanding in a number of those other countries with a different model, a bit, a different value proposition in part. But just the same to us, a proven space that we are a leader in, in several countries, looking to expand. So again, a great opportunity to grow and secure that leadership. When we look at Vacation Rentals, there's a couple of other big players in there, which have clearly proven that the market size is large. We have our own set of demand. We've made the transition to free-to-list really nicely. That's going to be -- as we indicated, a majority of our business on the transaction model, which we think is a better model than a pure subscription one. So mostly through that transition and continues to be a strong grower for us. So again, really nice opportunity. What we tried to do with some of the -- with the segment reporting is to give you some visibility into, hey, and how the management team do we sit around and balance the investing in the core hotel versus these newer growth vehicles. And you can see in the breakout, the newer growth vehicles, we could be pulling profits, but we're choosing to reinvest in growth. Because from our perspective, it's not a question of, if the markets are there or if the markets are big enough. It's a clear answer. Yes, the markets are there. Yes, the markets are big. Yes, we have either an existing leadership position or have a strong growth position in that market so the opportunity is clearly worth chasing. Ergo, the investment philosophy that we have for that segment."

All the various channels are bringing more demand to the site. We don't -- we can't talk about the overall growth. I remind you that on the TV campaign, even though $60 million is a pretty big number, we deal in a lot of markets with a lot of amazing sort of hotel shopper numbers such that the TV campaign will have an impact in hotel shopper growth, but it's kind of -- it's not one of those that we would expect to have a tremendous impact purely because of the scale at which we operate. As to sort of comps and this and that versus 2015, sorry, it's hard for us to predict. The core meta auction on CPC pricing, we predict or we model, I should say, a seasonally adjusted neutral CPC. So that's not to say CPCs don't go up and down over the course of the year, but when we look at this year versus a view into last year without meta, I mean, without the -- taking into account the lapping from the year before, we don't assume -- let me just start again. We don't assume that the auction dynamics will drive up or down CPC pricing going forward. So the mix will shift a bit to international if this year looks like last year. That might have a little bit of an overhang. Mobile traffic will continue to grow. Mobile revenue will continue to grow. That has a lower average CPC than desktop. So that's a bit of a kind of headwind if we're to average all of the CPCs. But when we do our modeling, we model first desktop and then mobile and add them together. And so the core question of hey, are we counting on auction trends pushing CPCs up or down? The answer is no to both. And yes, I mean, I'm not sure that there are big opportunities out there in auction land for the CPC in travel to go up a lot. So the auction has been running for many, many years, and I think the big players have mastered the techniques of running in our auction. So I'd be surprised if there was, all of a sudden, a big uptick. I wouldn't be able to explain it."

So mobile, when will it stop becoming a tailwind (sic) [ headwind ]? I guess I have a bit of a split personality on mobile because the hotel traffic, the shoppers are moving to mobile, but we have the best mobile product out there for planning a trip. And the downloads are showing that. The ranking is showing that. And everything -- every data point we can find says people are using the TripAdvisor mobile experience more than any other travel product. Therefore, we love the adoption. Consumers are liking it, but they don't monetize as well clearly. So are they using it to do their research and then popping back to the desktop to finish their transaction on TripAdvisor? Or are they using it -- are they using the phone app and then popping over to somewhere else to finish buying something? With our instant book initiative and the fact that the app is so much more comprehensive than the alternatives, we feel that as people continue to use the app on the trip, they get stickier and stickier with our experience. We introduced instant book. It makes that purchase relatively seamless. We're not fulfilling it. It's an OTA or a supplier, brand.com or whatever, but the convenience of doing that all in one app, the same app that helped you find the restaurant, the same app that helped you plan out your day, the app that's given you your map to get from where you're standing to where you're eating or where your hotel is, that's all part of an experience. That's part of what makes that TripAdvisor planning, that TripAdvisor on-the-go something that sticks with you. Therefore, if it sticks with you, you're going to come back and use TripAdvisor the next time. So the app monetizes better than the mobile web for us. We make continuous improvements in how all of that functions. And if we can do a good job of tying mobile together with the booking piece, we feel we'll be able to both improve monetization of the app, as well as get folks ready to continue to use TripAdvisor for all of their experiences. And when I compare that scenario to a Google or to some of the other travel sites, it's just not at -- we have something that is more complete, more full life cycle and therefore, deserves, by way of functionality, to be stickier. There was a second part of the question."

They're getting all of the support signals that they need in order to know it's the right hotel at the right price, right location, right everything to finish booking. And other companies have had years and years of experience in that part of the transaction. We haven't. And so we continue to improve. And I tell you, the team's done a really nice job over the past 6-plus months improving that transaction flow, improving experience, giving folks what they're looking for. And we know that because we see the conversion rate continually improve month over month over month. In terms of the mobile app experience, I just love it. It's hands-down better than meta. I can't recall seeing any feedback that says, ""I prefer a meta experience over the instant book."" So we've got a winner there. It's still subject to people being comfortable booking their leisure trip on their phone. But our partners that have been -- our instant book partners are saying, ""Terrific, love the bookings, love the experience."" And they call it a direct booking. And that's part of the name of the game for them is to be able to get more of those bookings. So no real concern about instant book being a problematic user experience.

We saw great user growth and engagement around the world especially on mobile devices, and we made nice progress on our various growth initiatives. Total revenue grew 35% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the year to more than $1.2 billion. Click-based advertising revenue grew 25% for both the quarter and for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $98 million for the quarter and $468 million for the year, up 88% and 23%, respectively.
Most importantly, 2014 began the next chapter for TripAdvisor, enabling users to plan, compare and book in 3 of our largest demand categories: hotels, attractions and restaurants. Our mission is to help travelers plan and book the perfect trip, and we are investing in a number of initiatives that position us for long-term growth. Starting this quarter, we will talk about our business in 2 distinct segments: hotel and other. Our Hotel segment encompasses click, display, subscription and transaction-based revenue from hotels, air, cruise, including our largest subsidiary, SmarterTravel, as well as our operations in China. Our Other segment consists of attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals, each of which are at earlier stages of growth. Julie will cover this in her financial commentary.
With that in mind, I'll update you on our progress in the context of what we plan to do over the next 2 years, and then I'll outline our objectives for the 3- to 5-year time frame. Over the next 2 years, our top priorities are to expand our lead in content and community and to help our travelers, not only plan their trip, but to book it as well. In terms of community, according to Google Analytics, TripAdvisor had more than 2.5 billion unique users in 2014, up approximately 25%. Needless to say, we're excited by our continued traffic growth, especially at our size.
And our community continues to engage and contribute more content. We eclipsed 200 million reviews and opinions. We're growing content at more than 125 contributions per minute in 28 different languages, and we nearly tripled non-English content over the past 2 years. Our clients are also engaging with us in more ways, with approximately 25% of registered property owners responding to a user review in 2014, and more and more independent owners, as well as a big hotel chains, are using TripAdvisor tools to make review collection a systematic part of their post-stay communications. With more than 1.6 million listings of places to stay, including 915,000 hotels and 650,000 vacation rentals, as well as 2.4 million restaurants and 500,000 attractions, TripAdvisor remains the preeminent brand in travel and leisure.
Content and community are the lifeblood of our brand. And in 2015, we plan to continue to aggressively grow these assets. Our engaged audience has a very high purchase intent, and we are making the TripAdvisor platform more valuable for users and advertisers. Consider that in a recent comScore study, over 40% of online hotel bookers in 9 of our top markets visited TripAdvisor at some point prior to booking. Through Instant Booking, we aim to monetize a greater percentage of these transactions by becoming a convenient place to compare prices and then book. Just this week, we rolled out Instant Booking to more U.S. desktop and tablet users and launched the feature to a small percentage of U.K. phone users.
On the partner side, we've been making nice progress as well, as we recently signed top hotel brands Accor and Carlson. We signed 43 partners in total, 12 that are live and are powering bookings and 31 that are being implemented. In Q4, we launched an Instant Booking beta on TripConnect, giving independent hoteliers direct access to TripAdvisor's global hotel demand. Early results have been positive and some partners have noted that Instant Booking has quickly become one of their most effective marketing channels.
Complementing our Instant Booking initiative, we recently added a ""plan, compare and book"" message to our online and offline channels. This includes TV, an area where we plan to double our investment in 2015 to approximately $60 million. We see television as an important way to get our new ""plan, compare and book"" message out to our global audience.
We have other partner initiatives that have made nice progress during 2014. First, we have improved our ability to demonstrate a strong ROI for partners through Business Listings. We now have more than 81,000 subscribers and have aligned pricing to more directly track to the booking value that a partner sees on our platform. Moving forward, we see Business Listings playing into a more holistic hotel-client relationship. This evolving relationship over the next couple of years will likely include products built on top of our data management platform, which is driving scalable, real-time insights so that partners can deliver the right message to the right user at just the right time. We're already seeing great early benefits in our display business, where we have maintained high CPMs across more than 2,000 advertisers in all major travel categories. We also can leverage these insights into our personalization and mobile monetization initiatives.
Finally, in mobile, we continue to expand our lead in terms of adoption and engagement on these devices. Nearly 50% of users visited TripAdvisor via tablet and phone in 2014, and our apps have been downloaded nearly 175 million times. This includes more than 155 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app, which has been growing organically at triple-digit rates for the last 6 quarters. We've achieved small but steady monetization improvements on the phone over the past couple of years. We believe Instant Booking can be a game changer here.
Next, let's talk about our strategy over the 3- to 5-year time frame. While our past, present and future remain deeply rooted in the hotel category, over the next 3 to 5 years, we want to help more users find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals and establish our leadership position in these categories. In attractions, Viator announced it will soon augment its curated model with an open marketplace. This will allow Viator to rapidly grow its product portfolio, giving users better choice and driving higher conversion to bookings. We're very pleased with our integration. And since closing the deal in August, we've more than doubled Viator's bookings from the TripAdvisor platform.
In restaurants, we've been very busy since we announced our LaFourchette acquisition in May. We acquired 3 more businesses in Q4, mytable and restopolis in Italy and Iens in The Netherlands. In addition to these markets, TripAdvisor's bookable restaurant inventory now spans France, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Sweden and Denmark, reinforcing our leadership position in Europe. We rebranded our restaurant platform as TheFork, and we're sending 4x as many restaurant bookings from TripAdvisor. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we're investing to significantly expand TheFork's reach within new and existing markets.
In Vacation Rentals, we continue to successfully scale our free-to-list transaction model. In 2014, we drove more inventory, more traveler inquiries, more bookings and strong revenue growth. At the end of Q4, we had more than 650,000 vacation rental listings driven by 73% listings growth in our free-to-list business. Free-to-list bookings grew 130% in Q4 and more than 280% for the full year, and we see this becoming more than 50% of our Vacation Rentals revenue in 2015. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on listings growth, owner engagement, user awareness and product enhancements to drive higher customer satisfaction and more transactions on our platform.
Finally, let me briefly touch upon some of our other long-term objectives. As the world's largest travel site, we gather information about traveler preferences and activities at phenomenally large scale. It's hard to predict all of the possibilities that this scale presents, but we want to make sure that we are always exploring what the next generation of travel planning features, products and services might be and how our scale can deliver benefits that nobody else can even dream of. Personalization is one such feature. Currently, we are personalizing millions of hotel shopper sessions per week, and users are engaging, clicking more and contributing more revenue per session. The beauty of this feature is not just the design and code that created it, but rather the machine learning that takes place over a multiyear time frame, driving a better set of travel advice and answers for every subsequent user. Over time, we want to be every user's personal travel guide, whether someone is looking for a place to stay, a place to eat or something to do while on their trip. Today, we are only scratching the surface of what's possible.
Another long-term initiative is becoming a top player in China. As the largest market for outbound travel expenditures, China is a huge opportunity for everyone. What differentiates TripAdvisor in this incredibly competitive market is that we bring the full range of travel content for your entire trip, not just a place to stay. During this past year, we broadened our suite of travel products tailor-made for Chinese travelers and have seen a growing demand for our international content. It is still very early days when it comes to tapping into the outbound Chinese traveler market, which is why our China business remains squarely in investment mode.
As you've just heard, 2014 was a year of great progress along our major initiatives, and we're at the early stages of many large and exciting growth opportunities. This month celebrates our 15-year anniversary, and I can tell you that there's never been a more exciting time for TripAdvisor. We continue to operate a massive and growing business at speed, staying focused on what's best for users, what's best for partners and what's best for our business over the long term.
Before I conclude, a reminder again about our investment philosophy as we pursue our growth plans. At $1.3 trillion in travel bookings, the global online travel market is large, lucrative and increasingly competitive. We prioritize top line growth, market share gains and EBITDA dollar growth, and we'll continue to reinvest profit when we see large opportunities in front of us.
Finally, I want to thank all TripAdvisor employees around the globe. Your hard work delivered these great results, and you remain our largest asset as we build a bigger and better business. It was a great 2014, and I'm excited about where we're headed.
I'll now turn the call over to Julie."

Fourth quarter total revenue was up 35% and 39% on a constant currency basis, driven by our large and growing click-based business, as well as a full quarter contribution fro",1344,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter and year. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 35% and 39% on a constant currency basis, driven by our large and growing click-based business, as well as a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. Q4 click-based revenue grew 25% or 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by 23% hotel shopper growth and solid CPC pricing for our high-value leads. Full year click-based revenue growth of 25% was driven by 17% hotel shopper growth and an easing pricing comparison due to our 2013 metasearch transition. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was positive 3% for the fourth quarter and positive 7% for the full year, a nice recovery from our negative 9% and negative 13% results in the comparable periods last year. As Steve noted, we continue to lead on mobile, and I'll add that just over 2/3 of our traffic growth came on the phone, which monetizes at a lower rate than desktop and tablet and continues to be a headwind.
Display-based revenue growth finished 2014 on a very solid note, growing 13% in the fourth quarter despite a tougher comp. Full year 2014 display revenue grew 18%, fueled by more page views, a shift in our client mix to a more attractive always-on spend cadence and bolstered by our ad tech improvements that has increased the marketers' ability to target. We maintain our premium position in the travel ad marketplace, and our 2014 performance compares very favorably to the declines posted by many other CPM-based businesses.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 97% for the quarter and 82% for the year. In addition to a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator, the primary drivers were value-based pricing in Business Listings and increased traffic, inventory and transactions in attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals.
Specific to geographic mix, our U.S. and U.K. markets remain strong, and we continue to see a gradual shift in a mix towards international markets. Most recently, we've seen a nice return to growth in LatAm, where we've made progress working with large regional OTAs in that market. International revenue or revenue to sites other than .com increased slightly as a percentage of total growth based on hotel shopper and CPC growth globally, as well as strong performance of our display and Business Listing products overseas. As a result, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, up 88% or 98% on a constant currency basis versus negative 19% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to the high concentration of television advertising in Q4 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% for the quarter and deleveraged 2 percentage points to 38% for the full year, primarily due to ongoing investments to gain market share in our attraction and restaurant businesses, which are operating at earlier stages of their growth cycle.
Steve mentioned our new segment breakout, which we believe provides us and investors with better information to assess overall business performance. We have provided historical revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each segment in our Q4 earnings press release. Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 26%, with very solid 42% adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year. Our Other reportable segment consists of attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These businesses are all in investment mode. Other segment revenue grew 141% in 2014, driven by continued strong growth in Vacation Rentals and our LaFourchette and Viator acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was negative 4% as we absorbed our attraction and restaurant businesses' cost structures and began to fund international expansion and top line growth initiatives in these categories. We believe we are striking an appropriate balance between growth and profitability today and believe that we could start to see adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in this segment as these businesses achieve global scale.
Moving on to headcount, we ended the year with nearly 2,800 employees, up 38%, driven by acquisitions and our investments in attracting and retaining top-tier talent to pursue our growth initiatives.
Our full year 2014 GAAP effective tax rate was nearly 30%, which is higher than our annual expectation due to certain discrete items. Our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate is 27% to 28% and is dependent on jurisdictional revenue and expense mix, among other factors. We ended 2014 with 146 million diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances.
CapEx for the quarter was $26 million or 9% of revenue. Full year CapEx was $81 million or 7% of revenue. Capitalized engineering salaries represented roughly 1/2 of our full year CapEx, while the remainder was driven by leasehold improvements to support our global growth and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. In 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $62 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and $387 million for the full year or 31% of revenue. The fourth quarter exhibited typical seasonality from our transaction businesses, Vacation Rentals, Viator, Tingo and Jetsetter, in which stays are incurred and tickets are used more in the third quarter summer travel season as opposed to the fourth quarter. We delivered $306 million of free cash flow this year or 25% of revenue.
From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities decreased $76 million during the year to $594 million, driven primarily by free cash flow, offset by the $331 million that we allocated for acquisitions net of cash acquired. We entered 2015 with just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $300 million, as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.
With that, let me provide our thoughts for 2015, a year in which we will continue to invest and build our platform to better serve more users and more partners. Note that we have changed how we provide guidance in light of the additional segment disclosure.
We expect full year total revenue growth in the high-20s based on continued broad growth across our product set, including a full year benefit from our attractions and restaurant acquisitions, offset by lapping the benefits from our metasearch transition, the ongoing shift of our traffic to mobile and international, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We will not be providing our traditional product guidance moving forward. Our move towards more holistic partner relationships may eventually include solution selling and bundling of our CPC, Instant Booking, display and Business Listings, potentially causing the lines between those products to blur. This potential evolution would make it difficult to provide a specific outlook for our traditional product breakout.
On the expense side, we are expecting slight deleverage on the cost of sales line from our Viator acquisition. We expect sales and marketing expense to delever as a percentage of revenue due to increased investment in our television ad campaign, as well as international expansion in our attraction and restaurant businesses. As our segment disclosure implies, Other segment revenue is growing well in excess of enterprise revenue growth rates, and we're trading off near-term profits for top line growth and market share gains in those categories.
Rolling it up, we expect 2015 EBITDA growth in the low to mid-teens. Using 2014 exchange rates, our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth expectations would have been approximately 3 and 5 percentage points higher, respectively. Finally, we expect stock-based compensation, as well as depreciation and amortization, to be roughly in line with 2014 levels or approximately 5% of revenue.
In summary, Q4 was a great end to a strong year. We expanded TripAdvisor's reach within travel planning and trip taking in pursuit of our goal to make the TripAdvisor platform even more valuable for users and advertising partners alike. We will now open the call up to your questions."

First, just when we look at the footprint of the hotels that have an instant book option when you're within a slice of traffic that's, in fact, exposed to it, it looks like a pretty good penetration already, largely driven by what looked like small OTAs. Curious if you can just give us some color on some of the reasons why you've been expanding that slice of traffic exposed to this so slowly. And maybe, is this an issue with just making sure customers are happy, is it a monetization issue? Some color on that would be great. And then as a follow-up to that, you've talked a lot about the fact that TripAdvisor's driving a lot of bookings that your OTA customers may not give you full credit for when they measure ROI, and this is something instant book can -- a gap that can be closed through better attribution. Wondering if you can just kind of give us some color on how you think you're kind of plugging that leakage in the early tests of instant book. And then even if economics today may not be as good as they could be long term with more OTA participation, does that matter if your plugging such a big hole and leakage?"

So you're right, we have a pretty good footprint when we look at U.S. traveler demand via our partnerships with several OTAs. There's a couple of caveats on the overall rollout. We always look at a bunch of different factors. Is the pricing as good or better than what the other meta options are, where the instant book is placed on the screen, the OTA sort of partners themselves, how well they're able to fulfill the transaction and then finally, the margin. When we look at the current rollout, and we've actually just increased the rollout this week in the U.S., we think of it as a steady march forward. We've got a lot that we need to get right because we're fundamentally responsible for a chunk of this transaction now as opposed to just the Meta Lead. So as we move forward, we want more suppliers. We're looking for a broader set of OTA adoption, if we can get it. But in general, there wasn't a strict rollout plan, but we're pleased with how it's been moving. In terms of the plugging the leak notion, one of the things we're able to do with this level of rollout is measure the repeat visit effect of the folks who are seeing Instant Booking versus the folks who currently only see meta, on desktop in particular. And in that case, what we've seen is a modest uptick in how folks are coming back because of -- coming back directly to TripAdvisor because of that Instant Booking interaction. It's modest at this point. We're looking at all different ways that we're able to both improve the conversion of instant book, as well as reinforce the message that TripAdvisor is a great place, not only to research your stay, but to really come back, make sure you're getting the best price and then finish the booking. So some of that is messaging, and that just takes time. Some of that is the actual instant book rollout itself, the product feature, but all of it focuses around where the question came from, which is that effort on our part that started last year and will take place this year and beyond to plug the leak and just get fair credit for all the transactions that we're driving but get lost in the online attribution shuffle."

So we do have good sized sales forces with the Viator acquisition, LaFourchette and the companies that we've acquired since. So you can tell, specifically in restaurants, that we're not shy about acquiring supply and, in some cases, supply plus demand in newer markets. We have a long history of acquisitions in a lot of different categories. Restaurants and attractions have no reason to be exceptions. But you've also noted that, from my remarks, we're expanding in Turkey, in Sweden, in Denmark, in Belgium, and those aren't through acquisitions. Those are through organic growth. And it's not that there aren't potentially companies to be acquired, but with each country we make a decision. We look forward and we say, there's a trade-off of integration versus organic growth. We're serious about the space. We're building out the restaurant-specific sales force. That's not shared with attractions or hotels because they're calling on different customers. But it is getting to be a decent size and, certainly, continues to grow. Attractions, we bought the clear market leader, biggest, most global player in the space today. Near as we can tell, far and away, bigger than the competitive set. That's not to say we'd be ruling out other acquisitions for additional supply and/or demand in various markets. As I said with restaurants, we have a history of doing that. But in no way shape or form should anyone view it as a requirement for our successful -- for us being successful in restaurants. Because, frankly, we look at the TripAdvisor points of sale in each country and say, ""In so many parts of the world, we are already where travelers are going to figure out what they want to do when they get there."" And so now it's just a question of plugging in Viator's curated product and, going forward, Viator's marketplace product, which will dramatically expand the number of products online, matching it to the demand that TripAdvisor already has. And so country by country, we pick up supply in both restaurants and attractions."

We note that on various phone devices there doesn't seem to be -- or at least no one else is reporting a lot of traffic coming from integration with maps. We find the user behavior of, ""I'm looking for a nearby restaurant. I'm looking for a nearby hotel. I'm looking for something to do."" You go straight to the traveler lifestyle apps that you were looking for and then ask for something near where you are because all of the apps in our vertical have high-quality Near Me Now functionality. So I don't really think of it as -- if the question was along the lines of, ""Hey"" -- and on a Google or an Apple map -- ""Is that going to be the starting point for finding me a great place to eat?"" I think that's a pretty far shift for the consumer to make versus starting with a restaurant app or a travel app or something tailored for that purchase. In terms of a better selling ROI, if this is in reference to Business Listings, what we've been moving on quite aggressively in 2014, especially the back half, has been better explaining the return on investment that we've been able to quantify for quite a large number of hotel chains and independents. And by this, I mean, we count the number of clicks. We count the number of phone calls that shows travelers going from our website directly to the hotel's website. And then where we're able to, we measure the actual transactions that happen. And then we walk it backwards and say, ""What's the return on investment for a Business Listing subscription?"" We model it where we don't have exact tracking, but the modeling frequently comes out at a 5:1 return, a 10:1 return or a 20:1 return on this investment. What we've tried to do in our pricing is align the pricing to where that return is, so that it's not underpriced, it's not overpriced, but it's a fair deal. It's a good deal for every hotelier that's looking to capture some of the demand that's sitting on TripAdvisor today. And that's, in part, some of our upticks in our TripAdvisor for Business and Business Listings product is finding the better price that matches the value delivered. And the final point, instant book pricing, it's a commission model. As you're aware, as we've rolled it out to independent properties in the TripConnect beta, there have been 2 price points offered, a 12% commission and a 15% commission. We have properties, not surprisingly, that tare taking us up on both of those. The higher commission, it's a little odd to say, well, pick your commission, but when a hotelier picks a higher commission, we guarantee that they will be shown more frequently than anyone else in the instant book auction. So hoteliers looking to take control of their own demand, looking to drive more bookings directly through themselves find that quite an attractive offering. And again, it's in beta. It's just coming out now. It's rolling out slowly. We've got a lot of opportunities to scale globally, but we're taking it with a measured approach to make sure it works for all the hoteliers that are signing up."

And in implementation phase, I'd say we're in interesting discussions with every chain that we have spoken with. So there's perhaps hesitation on timing. There's perhaps question marks on where this fits in the hotel's priority list. And then there's a discussion on commission. So every hotel would naturally prefer to take a booking directly on their own website, but we present a wonderful balance between -- we have a tremendous amount of traffic. That traffic is going to be on TripAdvisor and grow on TripAdvisor, we hope, in the foreseeable future. Folks looking to figure out where they want to stay that aren't yet brand loyal.

I can't point to any specific item other than a commission conversation that is a blocker in our discussions with the hotel chains. But every hotel chain, rightfully so, is looking to address their overall distribution costs. TripAdvisor comes in, and it can be an effective way to grow their direct bookings, but it's still a distribution cost that hotel chains need to fully understand. There's a piece of the sales cycle that we recognize that we perhaps didn't fully appreciate a year ago. We're not an OTA and we're not pure media with our instant book. We're not an OTA because we're not taking the booking, we're not charging the credit card, we're not providing support. But we're not pure media because, actually, the consumer is doing the booking while they're still on a TripAdvisor page. And we're sending all of the consumer information direct to the hotel so that they're charging the credit card, they're providing the support. So it's a model that they haven't seen before, and there's a bit of, ""Well, how do we, the hotel chain, model this out? How do we make sure it's not cannibalistic to our participation in Meta?"" And we have lots of sales materials. I think our sales job -- our sales team is doing a pretty good job going through it. But it, I admit, has been taking us longer than we expect. I couldn't name 3 things to do to clearly speed the cycle that I'd be willing to do. So again, progress every quarter, but no silver bullet there."

The ""plan, compare and book"" hel",697,"So a couple of factors. Certainly, we're expanding our TV. We've got a really exciting message to get out there to our audience. TV is a fabulous way to do that quickly. You've seen some of the branding change on the site. The ""plan, compare and book"" helps, from a positioning perspective, pull travelers back to TripAdvisor maybe after they've selected the hotel they want and now they need to compare prices. And hey, some folks don't realize that TripAdvisor is the best source out there to do that. And hey, there's an educational component. We're not moving -- to be clear, we're not moving away from our core asset of reviews and communities. But we do want to extend our brand value proposition to include price comparison so you can find the best price and the convenience of booking it once you've found that great price. So you have some deleverage that you can point to TV on. Then as we're dramatically growing the other component of the business, we kind of looked at it as, ""Hey, how does -- how would we, as stewards of this company, look at the opportunity in the attractions category?"" And we say, ""Wow, fantastic. Could turn it profitable tomorrow by a lot, if we wanted to."" But why would we choose to do that when the growth opportunity is so tremendous? I mean, we feel so optimistic about this category because it's so big and we're the ones that can bring the demand and the supply together. We just need more inventory. With more inventory, we can both grow our organic demand and buy more demand, and then we become known as the aggregator of, hey, what do I want to do when I get there? And that feeds upon itself. We get more supply. We get more demand. Bingo. And we not only retain our current leadership position in that category, but we become unassailable over years. And then, as with any business like this, margins flow really nicely out of it because as traffic builds, especially if it's repeat traffic or organically grown traffic or app traffic, customer acquisition is nil and you've got a beautiful margin machine here because it may not be hotel-level margins, but you have a very nice margin structure in the attractions biz. In restaurants, again, proven example, OpenTable is a remarkable company out there. Terrific margins, a strong team, amazing supply in the U.S. and it's greenfield in so many other countries. And we are expanding in a number of those other countries with a different model, a bit, a different value proposition in part. But just the same, to us, a proven space that we are a leader in, in several countries, looking to expand. So again, a great opportunity to grow and secure that leadership. When we look at Vacation Rentals, there's a couple of other big players in there, which have clearly proven that the market size is large. We have our own set of demand. We've made the transition to free-to-list really nicely. That's going to be, as we indicated, a majority of our business on the transaction model, which we think is a better model than a pure subscription one. So mostly through that transition and continues to be a strong grower for us. So again, really nice opportunity. What we tried to do with some of the -- with the segment reporting is to give you some visibility into, hey, and how on the management team do we sit around and balance the investing in the core hotel versus these newer growth vehicles. And you can see in the breakout, the newer growth vehicles, we could be pulling profits, but we're choosing to reinvest in growth. Because from our perspective, it's not a question of, if the markets are there or if the markets are big enough. It's a clear answer. Yes, the markets are there. Yes, the markets are big. Yes, we have either an existing leadership position or have a strong growth position in that market so the opportunity is clearly worth chasing. Ergo, the investment philosophy that we have for that segment."

All the various channels are bringing more demand to the site. We don't -- we can't talk about the overall growth. I remind you that on the TV campaign, even though $60 million is a pretty big number, we deal in a lot of markets with a lot of amazing sort of hotel shopper numbers such that the TV campaign will have an impact in hotel shopper growth, but it's kind of -- it's not one of those that we would expect to have a tremendous impact purely because of the scale at which we operate. As to sort of comps and this and that versus 2015, sorry, it's hard for us to predict. The core meta auction on CPC pricing, we predict -- or we model, I should say, a seasonally adjusted neutral CPC. So that's not to say CPCs don't go up and down over the course of the year, but when we look at this year versus a view into last year without meta, I mean, without the -- taking into account the lapping from the year before, we don't assume -- let me just start again. We don't assume that the auction dynamics will drive up or down CPC pricing going forward. So the mix will shift a bit to international if this year looks like last year. That might have a little bit of an overhang. Mobile traffic will continue to grow. Mobile revenue will continue to grow. That has a lower average CPC than desktop. So that's a bit of a kind of headwind if we're to average all of the CPCs. But when we do our modeling, we model first desktop and then mobile and add them together. And so the core question of hey, are we counting on auction trends pushing CPCs up or down? The answer is no to both. And yes, I mean, I'm not sure that there are big opportunities out there in auction land for the CPCs in travel to go up a lot. So the auction has been running for many, many years, and I think the big players have mastered the techniques of running in our auction. So I'd be surprised if there was, all of a sudden, a big uptick. I wouldn't be able to explain it."

So mobile, when will it stop becoming a tailwind (sic) [headwind]? I guess I have a bit of a split personality on mobile because the hotel traffic, the shoppers are moving to mobile, but we have the best mobile product out there for planning a trip. And the downloads are showing that. The ranking is showing that. And everything -- every data point we can find says people are using the TripAdvisor mobile experience more than any other travel product. Therefore, we love the adoption. Consumers are liking it, but they don't monetize as well, clearly. So are they using it to do their research and then popping back to the desktop to finish their transaction on TripAdvisor? Or are they using it -- are they using the phone app and then popping over to somewhere else to finish buying something? With our instant book initiative and the fact that the app is so much more comprehensive than the alternatives, we feel that as people continue to use the app on the Trip, they get stickier and stickier with our experience. We introduced instant book. It makes that purchase relatively seamless. We're not fulfilling it. It's an OTA or a supplier, brand.com or whatever, but the convenience of doing that all in one app, the same app that helped you find the restaurant, the same app that helped you plan out your day, the app that's given you your map to get from where you're standing to where you're eating or where your hotel is, that's all part of an experience that's part of what makes that TripAdvisor planning, that TripAdvisor on-the-go something that sticks with you. Therefore, if it sticks with you, you're going to come back and use TripAdvisor the next time. So the app monetizes better than the mobile web for us. We make continuous improvements in how all of that functions. And if we can do a good job of tying mobile together with the booking piece, we feel we'll be able to both improve monetization of the app, as well as get folks ready to continue to use TripAdvisor for all of their experiences. And when I compare that scenario to a Google or to some of the other travel sites, it's just not at -- we have something that is more complete, more full life-cycle and therefore, deserves, by way of functionality, to be stickier. There was a second part of the question."

And other companies have had years and years of experience in that part of the transaction. We haven't. And so we continue to improve. And I tell you, the team's done a really nice job over the past 6-plus months improving that transaction flow, improving experience, giving folks what they're looking for. And we know that because we see the conversion rate continually improve month over month over month. In terms of the mobile app experience, I just love it. It's hands-down better than Meta. I can't recall seeing any feedback that says, ""I prefer a meta experience over the instant book."" So we've got a winner there. It's still subject to people being comfortable booking their leisure trip on their phone. But our partners that have been -- our instant book partners are saying, ""Terrific, love the bookings, love the experience."" And they call it a direct booking. And that's part of the name of the game for them is to be able to get more of those bookings. So no real concern about instant book being a problematic user experience.

We accelerated total traffic growth, hotel shopper growth and content growth. We've made progress on all of our key initiatives and we remain solidly on track to deliver strong revenue and profit growth this year. Total revenue grew 29% to $363 million a 36% growth on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $127 million or 15% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's business performance was slightly ahead of our expectations and keeps our full year outlook intact. 
Our first quarter illustrated 2 important brands that position us for profitable growth for years to come. First, our core hotel business is strong, growing and very profitable. Click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant currency basis. And second, our newer attractions, restaurants and vacation rental businesses are growing even faster than the core. These businesses, while highly seasonal, contributed nicely to our revenue growth this quarter. These near-term financial results were strong and speak to a solid global travel backdrop. Now let me turn to our key initiatives and start with how we are expanding our lead in content and community. 
Listings grew 19% to 4.9 million  businesses with pages on TripAdvisor, including 16% growth in hotels, 25% growth in attractions and 19% growth in restaurants. We're seeing record user engagement as well, as evidenced by reviews and opinions growing at 45% to 225 million. And users are contributing at an accelerated rate of 139 per minute which is 39% faster than last year. In addition to reviews and opinions, users are also contributing ratings, helpful votes, saves, tags and a wealth of location information at massive scale, helping us to innovate, streamline and personalize the TripAdvisor experience across all devices. This metadata underpins our unique understanding of travelers helping us deliver a better product to our users and more targeted insights to our partners. 
On the partnership side, we're pleased to be one of Google's initial launch partners for customized voice action through the Google app, where users can say, okay, Google, show attractions near me on TripAdvisor and be directed to our app. Users can also -- users will also be able to find our content when they're asking -- when they're using Apple Maps. Both integrations highlight that on any device. TripAdvisor has great answers to the most frequent and fundamental travel queries: where do I want to go, where should I stay; where's a good place to eat; what should I do. 
Not surprisingly, having the most notable travel content on the web attracts the largest travel audience on the web. Traffic growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, growing 31% to 340 million average monthly unique users. Hotel shopper growth accelerated from the second straight quarter as well, up 26%. 
Another area of strength and deep engagement is mobile where our top-ranked apps have been downloaded 190 million -- 190 million times including 170 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We believe organic downloads and user engagement on mobile apps are a powerful indicator not only of brand strength but also the consumers view TripAdvisor's mobile products as an indispensable tool. 
Our continued outsized traffic growth speaks to our global reach. As we reinforced our leadership position in travel media, we're in the early stages of expanding our position to help more users transact with more businesses on TripAdvisor. In hotels, we expanded instant books reach in Q1. On the user we were pleased to introduce the booking feature to some mobile phone users in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. We're honing a more seamless booking experience on TripAdvisor and we're working hard to enable all English-speaking countries. 
On the partner side, we're currently working with over 50 OTA and hotel brand clients, including 20 that are live. Q1 was also the first full quarter of our Instant Book data for independent hotels. We're live with more than 70 connectivity partners and then thousands of independent hotels currently taking bookings on our platform. Early feedback continues to be very positive. 
I'd be remiss if I didn't call special attention to the extended Instant Book team, which is working tirelessly to bring our Instant Book product to more users and more partners. I thank them for their continued efforts. 
In attractions, the teams made great progress in improving the planning and booking experience for users and partners alike. I'm very pleased to announce that at the end of the quarter, Viator began the official rollout of the Viator marketplace, which will enable us to rapidly expand the number of bookable listings within the 530,000 attractions on our sites. Most importantly, marketplace will give users more choice be it to book things like a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon or skip the line pass for the Louvre or private tour of Machu Picchu, which in turn should drive more bookings for more partners and a bigger and better business over time. 
On the TripAdvisor side, our team completed a refresh of the attraction pages, giving users a cleaner and easier way to plan and book things on their trip. We're really excited about how attractions fit so well for users and our business. 
In restaurants, our listings content and traffic are all growing nicely. From the business development side, we are executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategy, which is building value for more users and more restaurateurs. We're investing organically to expand our new restaurant platform, TheFork, and recently expanded into the online reservation market in Sweden Turkey. We're growing through acquisition as well, adding Portugal-based Best Tables to the TripAdvisor family during the quarter. We see an enormous opportunity to leverage our content advantage, deep mobile engagement and 2.7 million restaurant listings around the world to match more travelers and locals with more restaurants. 
Last, but certainly not least, we're building a bigger and better Vacation Rentals business helping more users buy and book great properties on our platform. Listings growth reaccelerated to 18% and we now offer more than 700,000 listings. For some trips, the Vacation Rentals a better option than in hotel and free-to-list is helping us to offer as many high-quality listings as possible. During the quarter, we also finished a significant migration of our inventory on to one platform. While invisible to the user, this has enabled faster inventory onboarding, making it easier to develop -- to deliver more options to choose from. We're seeing the financial benefit as transactions revenue grew 200% and accounted for more than 50% of our Vacation Rentals revenue in the quarter. 
In sum, the year's off to the great start. We've opened an exciting new chapter for our business, building upon our leading content to enable more users to plan, compare and book their hotels, attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals on TripAdvisor. 
As I conclude, in addition to thanking our employees for all of their continued hard work, I also want to thank Julie Bradley, who announced that she's stepping down as CFO after almost 4 years. Julie has been instrumental in guiding the company through the spinoff, building a world-class financial organization and has played an important role in positioning the business for the long term. She's been a great partner in building TripAdvisor, and I thank her for her contributions. Thank you, Julie, and now here's Julie."

I'm confident that TripAdvisor's best [indiscernible] days lie ahead and I'm excited about the path they're on. It feels like a good time for this change. The business is doing well. The foundation is solid. I have complete confidence in the finance team, and I plan to stay with the company through September  or until we find my successor to ensure a smooth transition. I also want to thank our shareholders for their partnership and support. 
Now on to the financials. TripAdvisor turned in a strong first quarter despite the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen. First quarter total revenue was up 29%, driven by our large and growing click-based business as well as a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. In constant currency, our revenue growth would've been 36%. Q1 click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant currency basis, driven by 26% hotel shopper growth and very strong CPC pricing for our high value leads. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was negative 5% for the quarter. Absent currency headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been slightly positive, a great result as more than half of our traffic growth is coming on the phone, which monetizes at a fraction of desktop and tablet devices. 
Display-based revenue grew 9% in the first quarter against the tough year-over-year compare. We continue to improve our data management platform to deliver more value to a growing global list of marketers, including both travel and nontravel sectors. Our performance in this product category continues to well outpace industry growth rates.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 88% for the quarter, driven by contributions from attractions and restaurant acquisitions as well as by great organic traction in Vacation Rentals. Q2 should remain an easy comp in this regard, and then we expect growth to normalize as we lap these acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
Consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $127 million, an increase of 4% or 15% on a constant currency basis. Beyond these currency headwinds, these results reflect negative contribution from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions due in part to their revenue seasonality, which is heaviest in the summer travel months as well as our aggressive investments to drive global scale. 
From a segment perspective, our core hotel business remains strong, posting 20% revenue growth or 26% in constant currency with a very solid 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q1, we invested more than $10 million in television advertising to amplify our plan, compare and book consumer message. We plan to step up this investment in Q2 and again in Q3 to deliver our message into new and existing markets, heading into the heavy summer travel planning season. 
Other segment revenue grew 187% in Q1, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisition contribution as well as Vacation Rentals. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 12% for the quarter due to ongoing organic investments and high revenue seasonality in attractions and Vacation Rentals. 
On this last point, I'll again remind everyone that these transaction-based businesses have revenue that is heavily weighted in the summer months as we recognize the revenue when the ticket gets used or the stay occurs. However, their costs are more evenly distributed throughout the year. 
As we outlined on our last call, we are executing on a 3- to 5-year growth plan in these newer categories, leveraging our strong core hotel business to fund global expansion. Near term, our priorities are simple: drive revenue growth and market share gains. We believe adjusted EBITDA margins should improve over time as these businesses achieve greater global scale. 
Moving on to headcount. We ended Q1 with nearly 129 employees, up 38%, driven primarily by our attraction and restaurant acquisitions as well as our ongoing investment to attract top-tier talent. For taxes, our Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 27%, which was in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%. 
We ended Q1 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding and we estimated that our diluted share could increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to our stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances. 
We generated $99 million of cash from operations during the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $31 million or 9% of revenue driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $68 million of free cash flow in Q1 or 19% of revenue. 
A quick note on CapEx. This should decrease as a percentage of revenue when we take occupancy of our new corporate headquarters in late Q2 or early Q3. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capitalized expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue. From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities increased by $48 million during the quarter to $642 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $290 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million. 
As it relates to our outlook, our business has performed well year-to-date amidst worsening FX headwinds. As such, we continue to expect full year total revenue growth in the high 20s and EBITDA growth in the low to midteens. I'll remind everyone though we forecast on an FX-neutral basis, so future changes to FX could impact our 2015 outlook. 
On the EBITDA side, given the timing of our off-line marketing investments, the high seasonality of revenue and our growing transaction businesses and a fourth quarter cost structure from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions, we expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA year-over-year growth to be flattish before a strong step-up in the back half of the year. This will include $20 million of TV advertising spend, which is roughly $10 million more than what we spent in the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, we've had a solid start to the year. We're hitting our near-term objectives as we continue to lay the foundation for long-term growth. We will now open the call up to your questions."

In terms of monetization, we play the long games, so it's not just a question of getting to revenue-neutral or slightly above or slightly below. We're taking our best guess over the course of the rest of the year as to when we think we will roll out and how much. But as you know, some of it's not in our control in terms of [indiscernible] our control in terms of the timing of chains coming on board. So the short answer is, when we look at it going forward, we're not projecting a major financial hit by an instant book rollout. That's something that, at least at this point, we're not choosing to do. In terms of the OTA and the M&A landscape and the impact on TripAdvisor, the Expedia Orbitz deal is not closed. If one assumes that it will, and if I were to guess or hypothesize on what Expedia may do, so I want to be clear, but not sharing their potential plans with us, one might guess that they would take a bunch of their inventory that they have excellent margin on and put it on to the Orbitz platform and Orbitz will continue to bid it on TripAdvisor. That's at least the history of what they did with Travelocity. As they did that with Travelocity, that was kind of a net positive, I believe, for TripAdvisor, probably net positive for Expedia as they had another well-known brand that could bid on leads. And given that in general, I think Expedia's having slightly better margins than Orbitz, they would then be able to bid higher if they chose to. So all of that's obviously completely outside of our control. But when we looked at that acquisition, we think it would be a neutral to, perhaps, a modest positive to the auction dynamics on our site. Most of the auction dynamics is in the first 2 slots of the meta landscape, and the first 2 slots tend to be the biggest brands, and that tends not to be an Orbitz or a Travelocity. So that's why I'm reasonably sure it won't be a meaningful change, at best it would be a modest one."

We would expect that to continue to grow and for obvious reasons, much faster than a hotel. That's kind of why we do break out the hotel shopper number versus the total traffic. So if I look at the forecast on the total revenue per unique user, yes, we expect that to continue to going down. That's kind of our modeling our planning [ph] and it's not a bad thing to have the constant or the incremental traffic growth even in the segments that we don't monetize particularly well, a restaurant in Japan, for instance, today. But you can see as we move our booking capabilities into restaurants and attractions and expand them globally and expand them in multiple languages, that's a way for us to tap into that traffic growth that's not in the hotel segment. So we're by no means ignoring that growth, but it will always work for the foreseeable future be a lower monetizing consumer than someone who's shopping for a hotel. So the better, worse than historical, I think because of the shift to the phone and a bunch of our hotel shopper growth is coming on the phone and the user experience is delightful, excellent, all nice engagement metrics, but the likelihood that, that consumer is going to finish their booking on the phone is dramatically less than the desktop, therefore, the revenue per hotel shopper on the phone, much less than on desktop, which brings down the average of revenue per hotel shopper over time if you just look at it through a device lens. Obviously, we're making up some of that on the combination of pricing and conversion and getting higher quality traffic into the hotel shopper funnel on desktop to make up for the downward pressure on the phone."

In terms of on the phone, is the breakage being cured, look, we do see a repeat rate on the phone. Is it because people are getting more used to using the phone and if they flow through the booking, it's better they come back? Yes. Is it because IB offers are really nice convenient experience so they come back to use IB? Yes. What's the breakout between the 2? Really hard for us to say.

And when you can get that cost of customer acquisition down to be 0 because it's a repeat user, the rest of the business just turns out margin. When you look at attractions, it's less a winner take all because it's a more episodic purchase as the travel in general, but we already have the website that's the closest out there in terms of where people would go, research what they want to do when they're in market, when they're planning a trip. And we have, far and away, to our thinking, the largest number of installed apps with great attraction content with the 170 million TripAdvisor apps out there growing at a wonderful rate. So you take all of that and you think of Viator as the OTA for attractions, selling a product online that's not shipping a good but ticketless just like a hotel or packageless, it's just an electronic ticket that needs a bunch of information to sell it, we have that information; that needs the connectivity to be able to deliver inventory, the tour or the ticket not unlike a hotel reservation, and we're in a very good position, we believe, to be able to satisfy the demand that we know is out there. I mean focus right, quantify to that 60 billion, 70 billion I forgot the total number, but it's a really big number that already exist. You don't have to imagine anything else happening. It's just scattered over huge number of vendors include a ton of kind of walk-up or last minute purchase. And so if our destiny -- if we can hope for our destiny to be that online travel agency for attractions, then TripAdvisor brings the demand, Viator brings the supply and it's a pretty nice match on a product that's sold online with high margins. Gosh, looks very similar to the hotel space and we only own a couple of OTAs in the hotel space that are very big and very profitable. So we like those proof points."

We accelerated total traffic growth, hotel shopper growth and content growth. We've made progress on all of our key initiatives and we remain solidly on track to deliver strong revenue and profit growth this year. Total revenue grew 29% to $363 million or 36% growth on a constant-currency basis. On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $127 million or 15% on a constant-currency basis. This quarter's business performance was slightly ahead of our expectations and keeps our full year outlook intact. 
Our first quarter illustrated 2 important trends that position us for profitable growth for years to come. First, our core hotel business is strong, growing and very profitable. Click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant-currency basis. And second, our newer attractions, restaurants and Vacation Rental businesses are growing even faster than the core. These businesses, while highly seasonal, contributed nicely to our revenue growth this quarter. These near-term financial results were strong and speak to a solid global travel backdrop. Now let me turn to our key initiatives and start with how we are expanding our lead in content and community. 
Listings grew 19% to 4.9 million businesses with pages on TripAdvisor, including 16% growth in hotels, 25% growth in attractions and 19% growth in restaurants. We're seeing record user engagement as well, as evidenced by reviews and opinions growing at 45% to 225 million. And users are contributing at an accelerated rate of 139 per minute which is 39% faster than last year. In addition to reviews and opinions, users are also contributing ratings, helpful votes, saves, tags and a wealth of location information at massive scale, helping us to innovate, streamline and personalize the TripAdvisor experience across all devices. This metadata underpins our unique understanding of travelers, helping us deliver a better product to our users and more targeted insights to our partners. 
On the partnership side, we're pleased to be one of Google's initial launch partners for customized voice action through the Google app, where users can say, okay, Google, show attractions near me on TripAdvisor and be directed to our app. Users can also -- users will also be able to find our content when they're asking -- when they're using Apple Maps. Both integrations highlight that on any device, TripAdvisor has great answers to the most frequent and fundamental travel queries: where do I want to go? Where should I stay? Where's a good place to eat? What should I do? 
Not surprisingly, having the most notable travel content on the web attracts the largest travel audience on the web. Traffic growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, growing 31% to 340 million average monthly unique users. Hotel shopper growth accelerated from the second straight quarter as well, up 26%. 
Another area of strength and deep engagement is mobile where our top-ranked apps have been downloaded 190 million -- 190 million times, including 170 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We believe organic downloads and user engagement on mobile apps, the powerful indicator not only of brand strength, but also the consumers view TripAdvisor's mobile products as an indispensable tool. 
Our continued outsized traffic growth speaks to our global reach. As we reinforced our leadership position in travel media, we're in the early stages of expanding our position to help more users transact with more businesses on TripAdvisor. In hotels, we expanded instant books reach in Q1. On the user side, we were pleased to introduce the booking feature to some mobile phone users in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. We're honing a more seamless booking experience on TripAdvisor and we're working hard to enable all English-speaking countries. 
On the partner side, we're currently working with over 50 OTA and hotel brand clients, including 20 that are live. Q1 was also the first full quarter of our Instant Book beta for independent hotels. We're live with more than 70 connectivity partners and a thousands of independent hotels currently taking bookings on our platform. Early feedback continues to be very positive. 
I'd be remiss if I didn't call special attention to the extended Instant Book team, which is working tirelessly to bring our Instant Book product to more users and more partners. I thank them for their continued efforts. 
In attractions, the teams made great progress in improving the planning and booking experience for users and partners alike. I'm very pleased to announce that at the end of the quarter, Viator began the official rollout of the Viator marketplace, which will enable us to rapidly expand the number of bookable listings within the 530,000 attractions on our sites. Most importantly, marketplace will give users more choice be it to book things like a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon or skip the line pass for the Louvre or private tour of Machu Picchu, which in turn should drive more bookings for more partners and a bigger and better business over time. 
On the TripAdvisor side, our team completed a refresh of the attraction pages, giving users a cleaner and easier way to plan and book things on their trip. We're really excited about how attractions fit so well for users and our business. 
In restaurants, our listings content and traffic are all growing nicely. From the business development side, we are executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategy, which is building value for more users and more restaurateurs. We're investing organically to expand our new restaurant platform, TheFork, and recently expanded into the online reservation market in Sweden and Turkey. We're growing through acquisition as well, adding Portugal-based Best Tables to the TripAdvisor family during the quarter. We see an enormous opportunity to leverage our content advantage, deep mobile engagement and 2.7 million restaurant listings around the world to match more travelers and locals with more restaurants. 
Last, but certainly not least, we're building a bigger and better Vacation Rentals business helping more users buy and book great properties on our platform. Listings growth reaccelerated to 18% and we now offer more than 700,000 listings. For some trips, the Vacation Rentals a better option than in hotel and free-to-list is helping us to offer as many high-quality listings as possible. During the quarter, we also finished a significant migration of our inventory on to one platform. While invisible to the user, this has enabled faster inventory onboarding, making it easier to develop -- to deliver more options to choose from. We're seeing the financial benefit as transactions revenue grew 200% and accounted for more than 50% of our Vacation Rentals revenue in the quarter. 
In sum, the year's off to a great start. We've opened an exciting new chapter for our business, building upon our leading content to enable more users to plan, compare and book their hotels, attractions, restaurants and Vacation Rentals on TripAdvisor. 
As I conclude, in addition to thanking our employees for all of their continued hard work, I also want to thank Julie Bradley, who announced that she's stepping down as CFO after almost 4 years. Julie has been instrumental in guiding the company through the spinoff, building a world-class financial organization and has played an important role in positioning the business for the long term. She's been a great partner in building TripAdvisor, and I thank her for her contributions. Thank you, Julie, and now here's Julie."

I wanted to start by saying a few words about my decision to step down as CFO. My decision is a personal one based on my desire to spend more time with my 2 great teenagers before they head off to college. This was a hard decision for me because of how much I love TripAdvisor and all the people I work with here. In particular, I can't thank Steve and the rest of the management team members enough for their friendship and support. It's a great team. I'm confident that TripAdvisor's best days lie ahead, and I'm excited about the path they're on. It feels like a good time for this change. The business is doing well. The foundation is solid. I have complete confidence in the finance team, and I plan to stay with the company through September or until we find my successor to ensure a smooth transition. I also want to thank our shareholders for their partnership and support. 
Now on to the financials. TripAdvisor turned in a strong first quarter despite the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen. First quarter total revenue was up 29%, driven by our large and growing click-based business as well as a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. In constant currency, our revenue growth would have been 36%. Q1 click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 26% hotel shopper growth and very strong CPC pricing for our high-value leads. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was negative 5% for the quarter. Absent currency headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been slightly positive, a great result as more than half of our traffic growth is coming on the phone, which monetizes at a fraction of desktop and tablet search devices. 
Display-based revenue grew 9% in the first quarter against the tough year-over-year compare. We continue to improve our data management platform to deliver more value to a growing global list of marketers, including both travel and nontravel sectors. Our performance in this product category continues to well outpace industry growth rates.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 88% for the quarter, driven by contributions from attractions and restaurant acquisitions as well as by great organic traction in Vacation Rentals. Q2 should remain an easy comp in this regard, and then we expect growth to normalize as we lap these acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
Consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $127 million, an increase of 4% or 15% on a constant-currency basis. Beyond these currency headwinds, these results reflect negative contribution from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions due in part to their revenue seasonality, which is heaviest in the summer travel months as well as our aggressive investments to drive global scale. 
From a segment perspective, our core hotel business remains strong, posting 20% revenue growth or 26% in constant currency with a very solid 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q1, we invested more than $10 million in television advertising to amplify our plan, compare and book consumer message. We plan to step up this investment in Q2 and again in Q3 to deliver our message into new and existing markets, heading into the heavy summer travel planning season. 
Other segment revenue grew 187% in Q1, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisition contribution as well as Vacation Rentals. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 12% for the quarter due to ongoing organic investments and high revenue seasonality in attractions and Vacation Rentals. 
On this last point, I'll again remind everyone that these transaction-based businesses have revenue that is heavily weighted in the summer months as we recognize revenue when the ticket gets used or the stay occurs. However, their costs are more evenly distributed throughout the year. 
As we outlined on our last call, we are executing on a 3- to 5-year growth plan in these newer categories, leveraging our strong core hotel business to fund global expansion. Near term, our priorities are simple: drive revenue growth and market share gains. We believe adjusted EBITDA margins should improve over time as these businesses achieve greater global scale. 
Moving on to headcount. We ended Q1 with nearly 2,900 employees, up 38%, driven primarily by our attraction and restaurant acquisitions as well as our ongoing investment to attract top-tier talent. For taxes, our Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 27%, which was in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%. 
We ended Q1 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and we estimated that our diluted share count could increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to our stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances. 
We generated $99 million of cash from operations during the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $31 million or 9% of revenue driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $68 million of free cash flow in Q1 or 19% of revenue. 
A quick note on CapEx. This should decrease as a percentage of revenue when we take occupancy of our new corporate headquarters in late Q2 or early Q3. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capitalized expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue. From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities increased by $48 million during the quarter to $642 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $290 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million. 
As it relates to our outlook, our business has performed well year-to-date amidst worsening FX headwinds. As such, we continue to expect full year total revenue growth in the high 20s and EBITDA growth in the low to mid-teens. I'll remind everyone that we forecast on an FX-neutral basis, so future changes to FX could impact our 2015 outlook. 
On the EBITDA side, given the timing of our off-line marketing investments, the high seasonality of revenue and our growing transaction businesses and a full quarter cost structure from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions, we expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA year-over-year growth to be flattish before a strong step-up in the back half of the year. This will include $20 million of TV advertising spend, which is roughly $10 million more than what we spent in the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, we've had a solid start to the year. We're hitting our near-term objectives as we continue to lay the foundation for long-term growth. We will now open the call up to your questions."

So our interpretation of that is perfectly happy to leverage the trust that they have in TripAdvisor to start down that booking funnel. We don't disclose the actual conversion rate. We're not ready to disclose the actual conversion rate of those leads, but you can imagine as it's been rolled out on the phone in so many places and being out there that it's working well for us, and the rollout continues, as you've seen in my remarks, into other countries on the phone.

And then just secondly, there's a not a lot of M&A in the space recently. Maybe just some high-level thoughts on what that means for you guys.

So with Instant Booking, it certainly is a challenge for us to forecast that. In terms of monetization, we play the long games, so it's not just a question of getting to revenue-neutral or slightly above or slightly below. We're taking our best guess over the course of the rest of the year as to when we think we will roll out and how much. But as you know, some of it's not in our control in terms of -- not entirely in our control in terms of the timing of some of the chains coming on board. So the short answer is, when we look at it going forward, we're not projecting a major financial hit by an Instant Book rollout. That's something that, at least at this point, we're not choosing to do. In terms of the OTA and the M&A landscape and the impact on TripAdvisor, the Expedia-Orbitz deal is not closed. If one assumes that it will, then we -- and if I were to guess or hypothesize on what Expedia may do, so I want to be clear, they're not sharing their potential plans with us, one might guess that they would take a bunch of their inventory that they have excellent margin on and put it on to the Orbitz platform and Orbitz would continue to bid it on TripAdvisor. That's at least the history of what they did with Travelocity. As they did that with Travelocity, that was kind of a net positive, I believe, for TripAdvisor, probably net positive for Expedia as they had another well-known brand that could bid on leads. And given that, in general, I think of Expedia's having slightly better margins than Orbitz, they would then be able to bid higher if they chose to. So all of that is obviously completely outside of our control. But when we looked at that acquisition, we think it would be a neutral to, perhaps, a modest positive to the auction dynamics on our site. Most of the auction dynamics is in the first 2 slots of the meta landscape, and the first 2 slots tend to be the biggest brands, and that tends not to be an Orbitz or a Travelocity. So that's why I'm reasonably sure it won't be a meaningful change, at best it would be a modest one."

Just there's a lot more restaurants, there's a lot more languages that we're expanding on, and I would project that to continue into the future as we're big in restaurants and restaurants is often a very local used case on the phone. We would expect that to continue to grow and for obvious reasons, much faster than a hotel. That's kind of why we do break out the hotel shopper number versus the total traffic. So if I were to look in forecast on the total revenue per unique user, yes, we expect that to continue to going down. That's kind of our modeling, our planning, and it's not a bad thing to have the constant or the incremental traffic growth even in the segments that we don't monetize particularly well, a restaurant in Japan, for instance, today. But you can see as we move our booking capabilities into restaurants and attractions and expand them globally and expand them in multiple languages, that's a way for us to tap into that traffic growth that's not in the hotel segment. So we're by no means ignoring that growth, but it will always for the foreseeable future be a lower monetizing consumer than someone who's shopping for a hotel. So the better or worse than historical, I think because of the shift to the phone and a bunch of our hotel shopper growth is coming on the phone and the user experience is delightful, excellent, all nice engagement metrics, but the likelihood that, that consumer is going to finish their booking on the phone is dramatically less than the desktop, therefore, the revenue per hotel shopper on the phone, much less than on desktop, which brings down the average of revenue per hotel shopper over time if you just look at it through a device lens. Obviously, we're making up some of that on the combination of pricing and conversion and getting higher quality traffic into the hotel shopper funnel on desktop to make up for the downward pressure on the phone."

And when you can get that cost of customer acquisition down to be 0 because it's a repeat user, the rest of the business just turns out margin. When you look at attractions, it's less a winner take all because it's a more episodic purchase as for travel in general, but we already have the website that's the closest out there in terms of where people would go, research what they want to do when they're in market, when they're planning a trip. And we have, far and away, to our thinking, the largest number of installed apps with great attraction content with the 170 million TripAdvisor apps out there growing at a wonderful rate. So you take all of that and you think of Viator as the OTA for attractions, selling a product online that's not shipping a good but ticketless just like a hotel or packageless, it's just an electronic ticket that needs a bunch of information to sell it, we have that information; that needs the connectivity to be able to deliver the inventory, the tour or the ticket not unlike a hotel reservation, and we're in a very good position, we believe, to be able to satisfy the demand that we know is out there. I mean focus right, quantify to that, the 60 billion, 70 billion, I forgot the total number, but it's a really big number that already exist. You don't have to imagine anything else happening. It's just scattered over huge number of vendors, including a ton of kind of walk-up or last minute purchase. And so if our destiny -- if we can hope for our destiny to be that online travel agency for attractions, then TripAdvisor brings the demand, Viator brings the supply and it's a pretty nice match on a product that's sold online with high margins. Gosh, looks very similar to the hotel space and we only own a couple of OTAs in the hotel space that are very big and very profitable. So we like those proof points."

It remains a fast-growing market. It is super ultra-competitive. And when we look at our efforts to date, we have to acknowledge a ton of hard work by the team, good product, good efforts. But -- and I have to say it, sort of status quo, it's not what we're aiming for here. We're not winning in the way that we wish to. And so the team in China has come back and said, ""hey, here's the set of things that we need to do differently to succeed in a particular space within the China travel landscape."" Outbound travel you can see on the site is a particular highlight of ours, and it does, in fact, resonate with Chinese travelers because we have a phenomenal amount of international content. And while we have every hotel you can want to stay in, in China, the strength of us versus the competition for the Chinese traveler, we feel, it plays to our strengths focusing on the outbound. So you can see a bunch of that on the site today, and I can simply hint that more change to come over the course of the year."

We are off to a great start. We accelerated total traffic growth, hotel shopper growth and content growth.

We accelerated total traffic growth, hotel shopper growth and content growth. We made progress on all of our key initiatives and we remain solidly on track to deliver strong revenue and profit growth this year. Total revenue grew 29% to $363 million or 36% growth on a constant-currency basis. On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $127 million or 15% on a constant-currency basis. This quarter's business performance was slightly ahead of our expectations and keeps our full year outlook intact. 
Our first quarter illustrated 2 important trends that position us for profitable growth for years to come. First, our core hotel business is strong, growing and very profitable. Click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant-currency basis. And second, our newer attractions, restaurants and Vacation Rental businesses are growing even faster than the core. These businesses, while highly seasonal, contributed nicely to our revenue growth this quarter. These near-term financial results were strong and speak to a solid global travel backdrop. Now let me turn to our key initiatives and start with how we are expanding our lead in content and community. 
Listings grew 19% to 4.9 million businesses with pages on TripAdvisor, including 16% growth in hotels, 25% growth in attractions and 19% growth in restaurants. We're seeing record user engagement as well, as evidenced by reviews and opinions growing at 45% to 225 million. And users are contributing at an accelerated rate of 139 per minute, which is 39% faster than last year. In addition to reviews and opinions, users are also contributing ratings, helpful votes, saves, tags and a wealth of location information at massive scale, helping us to innovate, streamline and personalize the TripAdvisor experience across all devices. This metadata underpins our unique understanding of travelers, helping us deliver a better product to our users and more targeted insights to our partners. 
On the partnership side, we're pleased to be one of Google's initial launch partners for customized Voice Action through the Google app, where users can say, ""Okay, Google, show attractions near me on TripAdvisor,"" and be directed to our app. Users can also -- users will also be able to find our content when they're asking -- when they're using Apple Maps. Both integrations highlight that on any device, TripAdvisor has great answers to the most frequent and fundamental travel queries: Where do I want to go? Where should I stay? Where's a good place to eat? What should I do? 
Not surprisingly, having the most valuable travel content on the web attracts the largest travel audience on the web. Traffic growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, growing 31% to 340 million average monthly unique users. Hotel shopper growth accelerated for the second straight quarter as well, up 26%. 
Another area of strength and deep engagement is mobile, where our top-ranked apps have been downloaded 190 million -- 190 million times, including 170 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We believe organic downloads and user engagement on mobile apps is a powerful indicator not only of brand strength, but also that consumers view TripAdvisor's mobile products as an indispensable tool. 
Our continued outsized traffic growth speaks to our global reach. As we reinforce our leadership position in travel media, we're in the early stages of expanding our position to help more users transact with more businesses on TripAdvisor. In hotels, we expanded Instant Book's reach in Q1. On the user side, we were pleased to introduce the booking feature to some mobile phone users in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. We're honing a more seamless booking experience on TripAdvisor and we're working hard to enable all English-speaking countries. 
On the partner side, we're currently working with over 50 OTA and hotel brand clients, including 20 that are live. Q1 was also the first full quarter of our Instant Book beta for independent hotels. We're live with more than 70 connectivity partners and the thousands of independent hotels currently taking bookings on our platform. Early feedback continues to be very positive. 
I'd be remiss if I didn't call special attention to the extended Instant Book team, which is working tirelessly to bring our Instant Book product to more users and more partners. I thank them for their continued efforts. 
In attractions, the teams made great progress in improving the planning and booking experience for users and partners alike. I'm very pleased to announce that at the end of the quarter, Viator began the official rollout of the Viator Marketplace, which will enable us to rapidly expand the number of bookable listings within the 530,000 attractions on our site. Most importantly, Marketplace will give users more choice, be it to book things like a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon or skip the line pass for the Louvre or a private tour of Machu Picchu, which in turn should drive more bookings for more partners and a bigger and better business over time. 
On the TripAdvisor side, our team completed a refresh of the attraction pages, giving users a cleaner and easier way to plan and book things on their trip. We're really excited about how attractions fit so well for users and our business. 
In restaurants, our listings content and traffic are all growing nicely. From the business development side, we are executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategy, which is building value for more users and more restaurateurs. We're investing organically to expand our new restaurant platform, TheFork, and recently expanded into the online reservation market in Sweden and Turkey. We're growing through acquisition as well, adding Portugal-based Best Tables to the TripAdvisor family during the quarter. We see an enormous opportunity to leverage our content advantage, deep mobile engagement and 2.7 million restaurant listings around the world to match more travelers and locals with more restaurants. 
Last, but certainly not least, we're building a bigger and better Vacation Rentals business, helping more users find and book great properties on our platform. Listings growth reaccelerated to 18% and we now offer more than 700,000 listings. For some trips, the Vacation Rentals is a better option than a hotel and free-to-list is helping us to offer as many high-quality listings as possible. During the quarter, we also finished a significant migration of our inventory on to one platform. While invisible to the user, this has enabled faster inventory onboarding, making it easier to develop -- to deliver more options to choose from. We're seeing the financial benefit, as transaction revenue grew 200% and accounted for more than 50% of our Vacation Rentals revenue in the quarter. 
In sum, the year's off to a great start. We've opened an exciting new chapter for our business, building upon our leading content to enable more users to plan, compare and book their hotels, attractions, restaurants and Vacation Rentals on TripAdvisor. 
As I conclude, in addition to thanking our employees for all of their continued hard work, I also want to thank Julie Bradley, who announced that she's stepping down as CFO after almost 4 years. Julie has been instrumental in guiding the company through the spinoff, building a world-class finance organization and has played an important role in positioning the business for the long term. She's been a great partner in building TripAdvisor, and I thank her for her contributions. Thank you, Julie, and now here's Julie."

I wanted to start by saying a few words about my decision to step down as CFO. My decision is a personal one, based on my desire to spend more time with my 2 great teenagers before they head off to college. This was a hard decision for me because of how much I love TripAdvisor and all the people I work with here. In particular, I can't thank Steve and the rest of the management team members enough for their friendship and support. It's a great team. I'm confident that TripAdvisor's best days lie ahead, and I'm excited about the path they are on. It feels like a good time for this change. The business is doing well. The foundation is solid. I have complete confidence in the finance team, and I plan to stay with the company through September or until we find my successor, to ensure a smooth transition. I also want to thank our shareholders for their partnership and support. 
Now on to the financials. TripAdvisor turned in a strong first quarter despite the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen. First quarter total revenue was up 29%, driven by our large and growing click-based business, as well as a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. In constant currency, our revenue growth would have been 36%. Q1 click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 26% hotel shopper growth and very strong CPC pricing for our high-value leads. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was negative 5% for the quarter. Absent currency headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been slightly positive, a great result, as more than half of our traffic growth is coming on the phone, which monetizes at a fraction of desktop and tablet search devices. 
Display-based revenue grew 9% in the first quarter against a tough year-over-year compare. We continue to improve our data management platform to deliver more value to a growing global list of marketers, including both travel and non-travel sectors. Our performance in this product category continues to well outpace industry growth rates.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 88% for the quarter, driven by contributions from attractions and restaurant acquisitions, as well as by great organic traction in Vacation Rentals. Q2 should remain an easy comp in this regard, and then we expect growth to normalize as we lap these acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
Consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $127 million, an increase of 4% or 15% on a constant-currency basis. Beyond these currency headwinds, these results reflect negative contribution from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions, due in part to their revenue seasonality, which is heaviest in the summer travel months, as well as our aggressive investments to drive global scale. 
From a segment perspective, our core hotel business remains strong, posting 20% revenue growth or 26% in constant currency, with a very solid 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q1, we invested more than $10 million in television advertising to amplify our ""plan, compare and book"" consumer message. We plan to step up this investment in Q2 and again in Q3 to deliver our message into new and existing markets, heading into the heavy summer travel planning season. 
Other segment revenue grew 187% in Q1, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisition contribution, as well as Vacation Rentals. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 12% for the quarter due to ongoing organic investments and high revenue seasonality in attractions and Vacation Rentals. 
On this last point, I'll again remind everyone that these transaction-based businesses have revenue that is heavily weighted in the summer months, as we recognize revenue when the ticket gets used or the stay occurs. However, their costs are more evenly distributed throughout the year. 
As we outlined on our last call, we are executing on a 3- to 5-year growth plan in these newer categories, leveraging our strong core hotel business to fund global expansion. Near term, our priorities are simple: drive revenue growth and market share gains. We believe adjusted EBITDA margins should improve over time as these businesses achieve greater global scale. 
Moving on to headcount. We ended Q1 with nearly 2,900 employees, up 38%, driven primarily by our attraction and restaurant acquisitions, as well as our ongoing investment to attract top-tier talent. For taxes, our Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 27%, which was in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%. 
We ended Q1 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count could increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances. 
We generated $99 million of cash from operations during the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $31 million or 9% of revenue, driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development, and to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $68 million of free cash flow in Q1 or 19% of revenue. 
A quick note on CapEx. This should decrease as a percentage of revenue when we take occupancy of our new corporate headquarters in late Q2 or early Q3. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capitalized expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue. From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities increased by $48 million during the quarter to $642 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $290 million, as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million. 
As it relates to our outlook, our business has performed well year-to-date amidst worsening FX headwinds. As such, we continue to expect full year total revenue growth in the high 20s and EBITDA growth in the low to mid-teens. I'll remind everyone that we forecast on an FX-neutral basis, so future changes to FX could impact our 2015 outlook. 
On the EBITDA side, given the timing of our off-line marketing investments, the high seasonality of revenue and our growing transaction businesses and a full quarter's cost structure from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions, we expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA year-over-year growth to be flattish before a strong step-up in the back half of the year. This will include $20 million of TV advertising spend, which is roughly $10 million more than what we spent in the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, we've had a solid start to the year. We're hitting our near-term objectives as we continue to lay the foundation for long-term growth. We will now open the call up to your questions."

We are clearly on the path of leveraging the one that we have and we've seen sign-ups from individual properties come straight through our website, with very little by way of the touch of the sales rep. But for an independent property, I should say, for a chain property, we already have the key account infrastructure in place. For an independent property, the switch from a subscription or the addition from a subscription to a commission rate is quite well appreciated by the independent.

So with Instant Booking, it certainly is a challenge for us to forecast that. In terms of monetization, we play the long game, so it's not just a question of getting to revenue-neutral or slightly above or slightly below. We're taking our best guess over the course of the rest of the year as to when we think we will roll out and how much. But as you know, some of it's not in our control in terms of -- not entirely in our control in terms of the timing of some of the chains coming on board. So the short answer is, when we look at it going forward, we're not projecting a major financial hit by an Instant Book rollout. That's something that, at least at this point, we're not choosing to do. In terms of the OTA and the M&A landscape and the impact on TripAdvisor, the Expedia-Orbitz deal is not closed. If one assumes that it will, then we -- and if I were to guess or hypothesize on what Expedia may do, so I want to be clear, they're not sharing their potential plans with us, one might guess that they would take a bunch of their inventory that they have excellent margin on and put it on to the Orbitz platform and Orbitz would continue to bid it on TripAdvisor. That's at least the history of what they did with Travelocity. As they did that with Travelocity, that was kind of a net positive, I believe, for TripAdvisor, probably net positive for Expedia, as they had another well-known brand that could bid on leads. And given that, in general, I think of Expedia as having slightly better margins than Orbitz, they would then be able to bid higher if they chose to. So all of that is obviously completely outside of our control. But when we looked at that acquisition, we think it would be a neutral to, perhaps, a modest positive to the auction dynamics on our site. Most of the auction dynamics is in the first 2 slots of the meta landscape, and the first 2 slots tend to be the biggest brands, and that tends not to be an Orbitz or a Travelocity. So that's why I'm reasonably sure it won't be a meaningful change, at best it would be a modest one."

Just there's a lot more restaurants, there's a lot more languages that we're expanding on, and I would project that to continue into the future, as we're big in restaurants and restaurants is often a very local use case on the phone. We would expect that to continue to grow and for obvious reasons, much faster than hotel. That's kind of why we do break out the hotel shopper number versus the total traffic. So if I were to look and forecast on a total revenue per unique user, yes, we expect that to continue to be going down. That's kind of our modeling and our planning, and it's not a bad thing to have the constant or the incremental traffic growth, even in the segments that we don't monetize particularly well, a restaurant in Japan, for instance, today. But you can see as we move our booking capabilities into restaurants and attractions and expand them globally and expand them in multiple languages, that's a way for us to tap into that traffic growth that's not in the Hotel segment. So we're by no means ignoring that growth, but it will always for the foreseeable future be a lower monetizing consumer than someone who's shopping for a hotel. So the better or worse than historical, I think because of the shift to the phone and a bunch of our hotel shopper growth is coming on the phone and the user experience is delightful, excellent, all nice engagement metrics, but the likelihood that, that consumer is going to finish their booking on the phone is dramatically less than the desktop, therefore, the revenue per hotel shopper on the phone, much less than on desktop, which brings down the average of revenue per hotel shopper over time, if you just look at it through a device lens. Obviously, we're making up some of that on the combination of pricing and conversion and getting higher quality traffic into the hotel shopper funnel on desktop to make up for the downward pressure on the phone."

As evidenced by the full rollout in the U.S. and the more aggressive rollout in other countries on the phone, we like the experience, we're committed to it, we're rolling it out, we're not in a, must roll it out next week, but it's a train that there's no stopping, so we will continue that over the course of this year."

When we look at 26% this quarter and 20-something percent last quarter, those are great numbers of hotel shoppers coming to the site over and over and over again. So again, if next quarter it's a slightly lower number or a slightly higher number, it's just a factor that goes into the revenue. We're working off such a large base. And as I said before, what's going to get lost in some of those numbers are the number of hotel shoppers that come back within the same week or within the same month, which aren't counted in these growth rates. So again, growth rates slowing a bit. I mean acceleration is always a great thing, but slowing a bit is not, in my mind, a sign of an issue. It's really what we can do with those shoppers, and we've had some nice progress in that area. We've been in a situation where it's been growing more."

And when you can get that cost of customer acquisition down to be 0 because it's a repeat user, the rest of the business just turns out margin. When you look at attractions, it's less a winner take all, because it's a more episodic purchase as with travel in general, but we already have the website that's the closest out there in terms of where people would go research what they want to do when they're in market, when they're planning a trip. And we have, far and away, to our thinking, the largest number of installed apps, with great attraction content, with 170 million TripAdvisor apps out there growing at a wonderful rate. So you take all of that and you think of Viator as the OTA for attractions, selling a product online that's not shipping a good, but ticketless, just like a hotel, or packageless, it's just an electronic ticket, that needs a bunch of information to sell it, we have that information; that needs the connectivity to be able to deliver the inventory, the tour or the ticket, not unlike a hotel reservation. And we're in a very good position, we believe, to be able to satisfy the demand that we know is out there. I mean, Focus right, quantified it at 60 billion, 70 billion, I forget the total number, but it's a really big number that already exists. You don't have to imagine anything else happening. It's just scattered over a huge number of vendors, including a ton of kind of walk-up or last minute purchase. And so if our destiny -- if we can hope for our destiny to be that online travel agency for attractions, then TripAdvisor brings the demand, Viator brings the supply and it's a pretty nice match on a product that's sold online with high margins. Gosh, looks very similar to the hotel space and we all know a couple of OTAs in the hotel space that are very big and very profitable. So we like those proof points."

Outbound travel, you can see on the site, is a particular highlight of ours, and it does, in fact, resonate with Chinese travelers, because we have a phenomenal amount of international content.

We strengthened our platform, we deepened our relationship with some of the world's largest hotel chains, and we continued to successfully position our brand and our products to delight our users throughout more phases in the travel planning and trip-taking. 
Our second quarter financial results were solid despite significant year-over-year currency headwinds. Total revenue grew 25% to $405 million or 35% growth on constant currency. Click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency. On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million and would've been positive 15% growth in constant currency. We're navigating the near-term landscape with laser focus on executing on our 2-year and 3- to 5-year growth initiatives. 
Over the next 2 years, our top priorities are to expect our leading content in community to help our travelers not only plan their trip but to book it as well. We made excellent progress on these goals during the second quarter. First, TripAdvisor continues to set the standard in rich user-generated content and global community. Listings grew 23% to 5.2 million businesses. Users are adding content at a record rate of 160 contributions per minute, and we reached more than 0.25 billion reviews and opinions, up 50% from last year. We're helping more users than ever before as we had more than 1.8 billion unique visitors in the first half of 2015. In Q2 alone, we averaged 375 million monthly unique visitors according to our internal logs, up 30% for the second straight quarter. Also, hotel shopper growth remained strong, growing 22%.
We're doing a great job, winning the increasingly mobile user as well. Nearly 50% of our traffic visited on mobile devices and app downloads reached than 215 million. Continuous mobile product innovation is key. In this quarter, we launched our TripAdvisor app for Apple Watch, Samsung Gear and Pebble devices, bringing the power and convenience with TripAdvisor content to wearables . We also rolled out a new iPad app and new travel guides to help more users when they are looking for where to eat and what to do on their trip. 
Further, this quarter, we will cross the $100 million annual revenue run rate on phone, a great milestone for our mobile team and for our travel media business.
TripAdvisor remains unmatched as a place for users to plan a trip. Perhaps, more importantly, these milestones speak to an even larger opportunity in front of us to reduce friction, enable more users to plan, compare and book places to stay, things to do and places to eat on TripAdvisor. Though we're still very early days, we feel great momentum thus far in 2015. 
Specifically, in hotels, in Q2, we partner with Marriott International and another top 10 global hotel chain for Instant Booking. These are our third and fourth major hotel announcements this year, and we're now working with 6 out of the top 10 global hotel brands. Our Marriott partnership is a great example of what TripAdvisor can deliver as we bring Marriott an attractive global leisure audience and a great way to introduce more travelers to their 4,200 properties across their 19 industry-leading brands.
Additionally, we had the Mandarin Oriental, Langham Hospitality and Americinn during the quarter, and since the quarter ended, we further expanded our reach in APAC by partnering with Dorset hotels. We now have more than 60 chains, hotel groups and OTA partners and have grown Instant Booking supply to 235,000 properties or roughly 1/3 of the e-commerce-enabled properties on our site. This is amazing progress since our beta launch last year. We're also adding more independent hotels under the TripConnect platform through our Instant Booking data. Hotelier feedback continues to be extremely positive, and we look forward to working with many more independent hotels as our efforts there continue to ramp up.
Building high-quality hotel supply is a major step towards enabling more users to find the right hotel, fit the room and book on TripAdvisor with confidence. With our growing partner coverage, users were seen to be able to book more than half of 5 million rooms offered by the top 10 hotel brands. We like where we are in the rollout and we're excited to bring this feature to more users and more partners over the coming years.
Even before the feature is live on a more global scale, recent industry survey showed that TripAdvisor's influence in travel is massive and expanding. Last quarter I mentioned the comp score study that showed 40% of travel researchers who went on to make a travel purchase last summer visited TripAdvisor at least once. Our recent focus [indiscernible] that more than 80% of respondents believe that by visiting TripAdvisor, they pick a higher-quality hotel that's better suited for their needs. They feel more confident in their decision and perhaps, most importantly, they have a better trip.
On the marketing side, our plan compare book message is resonating in online and off-line channels, especially through our TV ad campaign. The same focus [indiscernible] survey found that a greater percentage of respondents that they are visiting TripAdvisor at least a few times more per year in 2015 versus 2013, which we attribute to our growing value to consumers as well as our increased TV presence. Beyond hotels, the survey found that users are coming to TripAdvisor more frequently in planning where to eat and what to do on their trip. Our 3- to 5-year growth initiative is to further improve user experience by helping more consumers around the globe find [indiscernible] attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals to reinforce -- and to reinforce our leadership position in these categories. 
Perhaps our biggest opportunity to do this is in attractions. Since opening up the Viator market -- since opening up the Viator business to a marketplace model at the end of March, industry reception has been excellent. Tourist and attraction operators have seen marketplace as a great way to showcase their products in front of the world's largest travel audience. In fact, Viator added nearly double the number of new products in Q2 as compared to all of 2014. Even before the marketplace rolled out, transaction growth has been accelerating as Viator leverages TripAdvisor's consumer marketing strength and global reach.
In restaurants, we're executing aggressively on our organic and inorganic growth strategy. In a little more than 12 months, we have extended our restaurant business into 12 countries. This quarter, we launched the Fork [ph] in Portugal and we also entered Australia by acquiring the talented team from [indiscernible] . That restaurant network has grown at an amazing rate and we're seating diners at more than 28,000 restaurants. Also, our restaurant products were perfectly suited for users on the go, and nearly half of the Fork's booking are made via mobile. 
In Vacation Rentals, our ongoing shift to a transaction-based model continues to progress nicely. Users can choose from more than 720,000 properties, and we continue to focus on adding more high-quality inventory. We're also in the process of refreshing our owner [ph] center, creating a simpler, more engaging and unified experience. The financial benefits continue to shape up nicely as transaction revenue accounted for more than 50% of our Q2 Vacation Rentals revenue. We like where we are in our shift of the transaction model as it is beneficial for travelers and homeowners alike.
At greater scale, lease businesses can drive stickiness to our platform, making TripAdvisor an even more indispensable travel companion. They are a long-term place and we are investing to capture a significant opportunity over the next 3 to 5 years. Near term, our priorities are simple, move fast, scale quickly, drive a better user experience and focus on revenue growth and market share gains. 
In summary, we're pleased with our recent traction and how we're successfully positioning the business for the long term. 
And now, here's Julie."
140233,302363425,837477,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9 point tougher comp, driven by our click-based busines",1012,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9 point tougher comp, driven by our click-based business and our hotel segment as well as our other segment. Note that in constant currency, total revenue growth would have been 35%, up from the 29% constant currency growth in the second quarter last year. Consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million, behind our expectation for flattish growth and would've been positive 15% on a constant currency basis.
Foreign exchange headwinds have continued to be a persistent challenge since Q4 last year, while our toughest funnel, hotel shopper metrics, remained strong, the U.S. dollar strengthened for the third straight quarter. This prolonged soft currency environment has led to weaker pricing outside of our strong U.S. and U.K. markets, which may be impacting international consumers overseas buying power. As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our strong traffic growth and we're navigating the soft currency landscape with caution as we are more focused on strengthening our business through the long term.
Q2 click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency, driven by 22% hotel shopper growth. This growth decelerated sequentially 7 points on a 12 point tougher comp. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was a negative 6% for the quarter. Similar to Q1, absent currency translation headwinds, Q2 revenue per hotel shopper would've been slightly positive. 
Display-based revenue grew 8% against a tough year-over-year comp, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds, slightly impacting currency translation and more significantly impacting our partner ad budgets. Our display team continues to deliver great value to our clients, leveraging our unique scale and robust data manager platform to deliver unique insights, offer a breadth of products and enhance targeting capabilities. These attributes improve campaign performance that rivals all competitors.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue growth accelerated 94% for the quarter, driven by contributions from prior year attractions and restaurant acquisitions as well as by continued traction from our ongoing shift to a transaction-based Vacation Rentals business. Note that we lapped our Viator acquisition in Q3, at which point, we expect growth to normalize.
From a segment perspective, our core hotel segment posted 13% revenue growth or 22% in constant currency, with 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in television advertising to amplify our plan, compare and book consumer message. We are seeing very positive results from this new campaign, and it is part of our 2-year initiative to educate more consumers to come to TripAdvisor to plan, compare and book. This investment sets up again in Q3 before stepping back down in Q4 due to travel seasonality.
Other segment revenue grew 210% in Q2, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisition and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 3% for the quarter as we invest in growth and market share gains as well as from high revenue seasonality in attractions and Vacation Rentals. 
Moving to headcount. We ended Q2 with just over 3,000 employees, up 43%, driven primarily by a prior year attraction and restaurant acquisition.
As far as taxes, our Q2 GAAP effective tax rate of 29% increased primarily due to changes in full year forecasted geographical mix. We continue to expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%. We ended Q2 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count would increase by less than 2% by the end of 2015, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buyback and new share issuances.
We generated $200 million of cash from operations during the second quarter or 49% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million or 6% of revenue, driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $177 million of free cash flow in Q2 or 44% of revenue. CapEx should decrease significantly as a percentage revenue in the back half of the year as we have now taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.
In terms of liquidity, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities increased $104 million during the quarter to $746 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We also have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan. We were pleased to complete a new $1 billion credit facility this past quarter and drew down on it to retire the outstanding balance of our term loan at a 25 basis point annual savings at our current leverage ratio. Our strong financial position enabled us to continue to be opportunistic on the organic and inorganic investment front as we pursue long-term growth.
Finally, as it relates to guidance, based upon our view into international CPC pricing today, we are tempering our near-term outlook. We now expect 2015 total revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20s and EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits. Our guidance reflects recent business trends and foreign exchange rate as of today and does not assume future positive or negative FX movement. As such, future changes in FX and their related effects on users and partners could positively or negatively impact our outlook. While we're incrementally cautious about the near term, I want to echo these comments that we're navigating these choppy currency waters and remain laser focus on what we can control, namely, building great products, improving the user experience and making the necessary investments to make our global platform more valuable over the long term. Our business grew stronger in the second quarter, and we're excited about where we're headed. 
We will now open the call to your questions."

We know that this is our customers that generally want to book on TripAdvisor. It's more convenient, it's easier on the phone. It's got lots of reasons why that's a desirable end state, but that compare piece is really quite important to our consumers.

We want to offer that as features, offer that as capabilities so that [indiscernible] of business that we currently have we don't expect to ever going away. In fact, offering that price comparison for the -- in the hotel space is key. So we expect the hotel space to migrate towards transaction, but where I see Vacation Rentals being in the future, I would expect it to be almost all transaction-oriented. I think hotels will remain split for the foreseeable future. In terms of restaurants, really it's all transaction, in terms of well, the restaurants media or restaurants that we don't take reservations on and then obviously transaction on the reservation. And then attraction, there really isn't a marketplace that people are price shopping on. The prices are generally set, so again, media for the attractions that aren't bookable and we would expect it to move to transactions for ones that are bookable."

The beauty of having a meta model going to a transaction model or adding a transaction model means that we have a wonderful way currently, we always have, to monetize all of the hotels that have -- that are e-commerce enabled, which is a huge percentage and certainly the vast, vast, vast majority of all the page views. So to offer value proposition to the consumer, hey, finally compare prices, I got it, don't need to change anything. So I get to layer on Instant Booking as the transactional model where we have connectivity, where it works pricing-wise without sort of -- compared to being for the [indiscernible] an online traveler agency just starting up only having a limited set of inventory. We're not in that case. We have all the inventory.

We've opened up the platform so that anybody who is connected can sign up because we really never discriminate or preference against the small hotel in the middle of nowhere if they are connected with an Internet booking engine to us today, awesome. They get to sign up today and we'll send them bookings relating to the traffic we have.

I wish I could be definitive in the answer. It actually does -- there are a lot of factors at play. So when you have a relationship with a chain, it tends to be at a more global commission rate, and some of those properties might list themselves on an OTA at a rate that the individual properties sort of tops up. That can make the CPC that an OTA player will pay us more valuable to us than the direct commission we get from the chain. When the individual property doesn't do that, then the propensity of consumers, some consumers, to choose a supplier direct partner plus the very reasonable commissions that we're getting from our suppliers -- from our clients, yes, it works out. I started my answer by saying, it's not quite as simple as that because even within chains, we have -- certainly with independents, we have different levels of content. And by that, I mean room descriptions, rate plans, and I need to caveat the answer by saying all of the things being equal, room descriptions being just as good on an OTA site as in our Instant Book and the pricing being just as good and certainly the availability. So we look at the equation and say, the limiting factor on us rolling out Instant Book tends to be around, are we giving the consumer a great experience, which, in turn, is related to do we have good room descriptions, do we have good rates, is the connectivity really working in all the cases and how many intermediaries are there in the connectivity, namely, supplier direct relationship being the fewest intermediaries in terms of us being able to match the equivalent meta [ph] of CPCs."

There was some FX translation, incremental headwinds that we saw at this past quarter, but only about 100 to 200 basis points since our Q1 call. The real impact was around international pricing. So I think the best way to look at that is through our supplemental metrics that we posted on our IR website. You'll see there that revenue growth by geography -- it really highlights the strength. When you look at a different geographies year-over-year contribution, North America represented 61% of the growth this past quarter versus 36% in Q2 of 2014, whereas if you look at EMEA, they contributed only 24% of the growth last quarter compared to 45% last year and APAC was 7% of the growth this last quarter versus 16% of last year. And then it's even larger when you look at it sequentially. North America growth accelerated, while international regions decelerated. So we think the soft currency landscape has -- had some modest benefit for travelers from a stronger market, like our U.S. and U.K. market, as they've been able to increase their buying power, but the opposite is true for travelers outside the U.S. and U.K. for whom, overseas travel has gotten a lot more expensive. So we believe this may explain why we continue to see strong demand around the globe up in traffic. Overall, traffic globally were strong, but in Europe and Asia, we're not seeing the revenue growth due to pricing. So we're trying to be cautious and not assuming that any of these trends are going to change over the balance of the year, and that's why we felt it was prudent to lower our guidance expectations to what we're seeing today both from a pricing standpoint and a translation standpoint."

So we're certainly in discussions with every partner that you can imagine. I presume we're talking chains and hotel groups. I don't want to set expectations that we'll get all of the rest of the 10 in the next quarter because some of these folks move faster than others. Obviously, Best Western choice move very quickly. They're in a different luxury class. Marriott was a big win for us. They cover a lot of different types of hotels and are viewed by many as a leader in the space. So that's certainly helped propel a number of discussions, but I remind folks but that we don't need 10 out of the top 10 or 20 out of the top 20 to be wonderfully successful with Instant Book. Unlike in OTA, if hotel brand a is not directly connected with us in Instant Book, they still have all their properties through an OTA, through our own Tingo or get a room or many of our other OTA partners. So we still have the ability to do an Instant Booking with those folks. The margin may not be as good to us when we go through the intermediary, but we can still offer that service or we choose not to enable Instant Book on that property and our consumer still has the full meta experience. So our ability to roll that out gradual certainly has helped us over time because we were able to rollout Instant Book with only a couple of suppliers. It helps our economics to get more suppliers onboard, that's great, but we're not -- there's no requirement and I don't want to set expectations that once we get 10 out of 10, we would roll out Instant Booking everywhere. It's not at all how I think about the equation."

So let me just start with what we do have full visibility to is on the attractions side, where we have seen -- because we see the full transaction compared to hotels where we don't necessarily know the downstream conversions, but we have seen within attractions that the 3 quarters of strengthening dollar has negatively impacted the average order value. So if the Europeans, for example, are going to take a trip, they might take the walking tour versus the helicopter ride. So they're being a little bit more price-sensitive. What we've seen on the hotel side is a decline in pricing, and we've also been able to determine from where our consumers are coming from and the hotels that they're looking at that they do seem to say intra-Europe so not going as far away and maybe on shorter stays. So we think the combination of what's going on in the currency has -- just the overall claimant is negatively impacting the consumers."

How can I maximize the traffic I get through all available means?

They just want to click on the meta link like I've been doing for the past umpteen years, so they keep that by there. And then the ones that are connected get to go for the Instant Booking. So we talk to the hotels and I think they look at it as sort of 3 by set to traveler and they're able to maximize the number of bookings they're getting and they're buying directly from TripAdvisor, and that's a good thing.

And the other piece of it, what I had mentioned before, and more specifically of what we've seen as of late, within attractions because we do get to see the complete funnel with attractions, is there's clearly a change in consumer behavior, where they're booking low -- lower value towards their attractions. And then in our own traffic log files, we're able to see that the European consumer in particular, is they're still traveling but they are traveling intra-Europe or having shorter stays. I think part of the ADR question as well is the U.S. is traveling and the stronger currencies are taking advantage as the lower currency areas.

In other words, everything that we collect in the booking path for Instant Booking, we are sending off to the hotel. It's actually -- we get more information during Instant Book than when we send off a meta click because when someone does an Instant Booking, now I know who they are, I have a new member with an e-mail address if they weren't already a member, whereas with the quick, they offer a lot of clicks in the meta model, they're not already members, they click off. And really all I know about them is that this IP address or this computer looked at this hotel and I have no way to message them. Particularly nice on a phone or on a desktop. And as we build up our brand as a place to come back to book, we're building up a customer base that is used to booking on TripAdvisor. And then when we're looking at on the phone where we've been out for a bit longer, not surprising, we're seeing more and more repeat bookings coming from users not only did they book once in Instant Book on the phone. They booked a second time and a third time, and of course, that's what you would see with any e-commerce site and we're seeing it as well."

Our content and community grew quickly. We strengthened our platform. We deepened our relationship with some of the world's largest hotel chains, and we continued to successfully position our brand and our products to delight more users throughout more phases of the travel planning and trip taking. 
Our second quarter financial results were solid despite significant year-over-year currency headwinds. Total revenue grew 25% to $405 million or 35% growth on constant currency. Click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency.
On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million and would've been positive 15% growth in constant currency. We're navigating the near-term landscape with laser focus on executing on our 2-year and 3- to 5-year growth initiatives.
Over the next 2 years, our top priorities are to expand our leading content and community and to help our travelers not only plan their trip but to book it as well. We made excellent progress on these goals during the second quarter. First, TripAdvisor continues to set the standard in rich user-generated content and global community. Listings grew 23% to 5.2 million businesses. Users are adding content at a record rate of 160 contributions per minute, and we reached more than 0.25 billion reviews and opinions, up 50% from last year. We're helping more users than ever before as we had more than 1.8 billion unique visitors in the first half of 2015. In Q2 alone, we averaged 375 million monthly unique visitors according to our internal logs, up 30% for the second straight quarter. Also, hotel shopper growth remained strong, growing 22%.
We're doing a great job winning the increasingly mobile user as well. Nearly 50% of our traffic visited on mobile devices, and app downloads reached than 215 million. Continuous mobile product innovation is key. In this quarter, we launched our TripAdvisor app for Apple Watch, Samsung Gear and Pebble devices, bringing the power and convenience with TripAdvisor content to wearables. We also rolled out a new iPad app and new travel guides to help more users when they are looking for where to eat and what to do on their trip.
Further, this quarter, we will cross the $100 million annual revenue run rate on phone, a great milestone for our mobile team and for our travel media business.
TripAdvisor remains unmatched as a place for users to plan a trip. Perhaps, more importantly, these milestones speak to an even larger opportunity in front of us to reduce friction, enable more users to plan, compare and book places to stay, things to do and places to eat on TripAdvisor. Though we're still very early days, we feel great momentum, thus far, in 2015.
Specifically in hotels, in Q2, we partner with Marriott International and another top 10 global hotel chain for Instant Booking. These are our third and fourth major hotel announcements this year, and we're now working with 6 out of the top 10 global hotel brands. Our Marriott partnership is a great example of what TripAdvisor can deliver as we bring Marriott an attractive global leisure audience and a great way to introduce more travelers to their 4,200 properties across their 19 industry-leading brands.
Additionally, we had the Mandarin Oriental, Langham Hospitality and Americinn during the quarter, and since the quarter ended, we further expanded our reach in APAC by partnering with Dorset hotels. We now have more than 60 chains, hotel groups and OTA partners and have grown Instant Booking supply to 235,000 properties or roughly 1/3 of the e-commerce-enabled properties on our site. This is an amazing progress since our beta launch last year. We're also adding more independent hotels under the TripConnect platform through our Instant Booking data. Hotelier feedback continues to be extremely positive, and we look forward to working with many more independent hotels as our efforts there continue to ramp.
Building high-quality hotel supply is a major step towards enabling more users to find the right hotel, pick the room and book on TripAdvisor with confidence. With our growing partner coverage, users will soon be able to book more than half of 5 million rooms offered by the top 10 hotel brands. We like where we are in the rollout, and we're excited to bring this feature to more users and more partners over the coming year.
Even before the feature is live on a more global scale, recent industry survey showed that TripAdvisor's influence in travel is massive and expanding. Last quarter, I mentioned the comp score study that showed 40% of travel researchers who went on to make a travel purchase last summer visited TripAdvisor at least once. A recent Focusrite survey showed that more than 80% of respondents believe that by visiting TripAdvisor, they pick a higher-quality hotel that's better suited for their needs. They feel more confident in their decision and, perhaps, most importantly, they have a better trip.
On the marketing side, our plan, compare and book message is resonating in online and off-line channels, especially through our TV ad campaign. The same Focusrite survey found that a greater percentage of respondents said they are visiting TripAdvisor at least a few times more per year in 2015 versus 2013, which we attribute to our growing value to consumers as well as our increased TV presence. Beyond hotels, the survey found that users are coming to TripAdvisor more frequently on planning where to eat and what to do on their trip. Our 3- to 5-year growth initiative is to further improve the user experience by helping more consumers around the globe find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals to reinforce -- and to reinforce our leadership position in these categories.
Perhaps our biggest opportunity to do this is in attractions. Since opening up the Viator market -- since opening up the Viator business to a marketplace model at the end of March, industry reception has been excellent. Tourist and attraction operators have seen marketplace as a great way to showcase their products in front of the world's largest travel audience. In fact, Viator added nearly double the number of new products in Q2 as compared to all of 2014. Even before the marketplace rolled out, transaction growth has been accelerating as Viator leverages TripAdvisor's consumer marketing strength and global reach.
In restaurants, we're executing aggressively on our organic and inorganic growth strategy. In a little more than 12 months, we have extended our restaurant business into 12 countries. This quarter, we launched TheFork in Portugal, and we also entered Australia by acquiring the talented team from Dimmi. The restaurant network has grown at an amazing rate, and we're seating diners at more than 28,000 restaurants. Also, our restaurant products were perfectly suited for users on the go, and nearly half of TheFork's booking are made via mobile.
In Vacation Rentals, our ongoing shift to a transaction-based model continues to progress nicely. Users can choose from more than 720,000 properties, and we continue to focus on adding more high-quality inventory. We're also in the process of refreshing our Owners Center, creating a simpler, more engaging and unified experience. The financial benefits continue to shape up nicely as transaction revenue accounted for more than 50% of our Q2 Vacation Rentals revenue. We like where we are in our shift of the transaction model as it is beneficial for travelers and homeowners alike.
At greater scale, lease businesses can drive stickiness to our platform, making TripAdvisor an even more indispensable travel companion. They are a long-term place, and we are investing to capture a significant opportunity over the next 3 to 5 years.
Near term, our priorities are simple, move fast, scale quickly, drive a better user experience and focus on revenue growth and market share gains.
In summary, we're pleased with our recent traction and how we're successfully positioning the business for the long term.
And now here's Julie."
140233,302363425,837814,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9 point tougher comp, driven by our click-based busines",1013,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9 point tougher comp, driven by our click-based business and our hotel segment as well as our other segment. Note that in constant currency, total revenue growth would have been 35%, up from the 29% constant currency growth in the second quarter last year. Consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million, behind our expectation for flattish growth and would've been positive 15% on a constant-currency basis.
Foreign exchange headwinds have continued to be a persistent challenge since Q4 last year. While our top of funnel, hotel shopper metrics, remained strong, the U.S. dollar strengthened for the third straight quarter. This prolonged soft currency environment has led to weaker pricing outside of our strong U.S. and U.K. markets, which may be impacting international consumers overseeing [ph] buying power. As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our strong traffic growth, and we're navigating the soft currency landscape with caution as we are more focused on strengthening our business for the long term.
Q2 click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency, driven by 22% hotel shopper growth. This growth decelerated sequentially 7 points on a 12 point tougher comp. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was a negative 6% for the quarter. Similar to Q1, absent currency translation headwinds, Q2 revenue per hotel shopper would have been slightly positive.
Display-based revenue grew 8% against a tough year-over-year comp, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds, slightly impacting currency translation and more significantly impacting our partner ad budgets. Our display team continues to deliver great value to our clients, leveraging our unique scale and robust data manager platform to deliver unique insights, offer breadth of products and enhance targeting capabilities. These attributes improve campaign performance that rivals all competitors.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue growth accelerated 94% for the quarter, driven by contributions from prior year attractions and restaurant acquisitions as well as by continued traction from our ongoing shift to a transaction-based Vacation Rentals business. Note that we lapped our Viator acquisition in Q3, at which point, we expect growth to normalize.
From a segment perspective, our core hotel segment posted 13% revenue growth or 22% in constant currency with 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in television advertising to amplify our plan, compare and book consumer message. We are seeing very positive results from this new campaign, and it is part of our 2-year initiative to educate more consumers to come to TripAdvisor to plan, compare and book. This investment steps up again in Q3 before stepping back down in Q4 due to travel seasonality.
Other segment revenue grew 210% in Q2, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 3% for the quarter as we invest in growth and market share gains as well as from high-revenue seasonality in attractions and Vacation Rentals.
Moving to headcount. We ended Q2 with just over 3,000 employees, up 43%, driven primarily by a prior year attraction and restaurant acquisitions.
As far as taxes, our Q2 GAAP effective tax rate of 29% increased primarily due to changes in full year forecasted geographical mix. We continue to expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%.
We ended Q2 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count would increase by less than 2% by the end of 2015, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buyback and new share issuances.
We generated $200 million of cash from operations during the second quarter or 49% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million or 6% of revenue, driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $177 million of free cash flow in Q2 or 44% of revenue. CapEx should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue in the back half of the year as we have now taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.
In terms of liquidity, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities increased $104 million during the quarter to $746 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We also had just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan. We were pleased to complete a new $1 billion credit facility this past quarter and drew down on it to retire the outstanding balance of our term loan at a 25 basis point annual savings at our current leverage ratio. Our strong financial position enabled us to continue to be opportunistic on the organic and inorganic investment front as we pursue long-term growth.
Finally, as it relates to guidance, based upon our view into international CPC pricing today, we are tampering our near-term outlook. We now expect 2015 total revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20s and EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits. Our guidance reflects recent business trends and foreign exchange rates as of today and does not assume future positive or negative FX movement. As such, future changes in FX and their related effects on users and partners could positively or negatively impact our outlook.
While we're incrementally cautious about the near term, I want to echo Steve's comments that we're navigating these choppy currency waters and remain laser-focused on what we can control, namely, building great products, improving the user experience and making the necessary investments to make our global platform more valuable over the long term. Our business grew stronger in the second quarter, and we're excited about where we're headed.
We will now open the call up to your questions."

We know that -- this was said by our customers that generally want to book on TripAdvisor, it's more convenient. It's easier on the phone. It's kind of -- lots of reasons why that's a desirable end state. But that compare piece is really quite important to our consumers. And so where a traveler has a preference for a particular supplier, has a preference for a particular OTA, has a preference for a particular booking channel, we'll be at the phone, as in dialing a telephone number. All of that's fine with us. We want to offer that as features, offer that as capabilities, so that the meta business that we currently have, we don't expect this ever going away. In fact, offering that price comparison for the -- in the hotel space is key. So we expect the hotel space to migrate towards transaction. But where I see Vacation Rentals being in the future, I would expect it to be almost all transaction-oriented. I think hotels will remain split for the foreseeable future. In terms of restaurants, really, it's all transaction. In terms of -- well, the restaurants, it's media for restaurants that we don't take reservations on, and then, obviously, transaction on the reservation. And then attraction, there really isn't a marketplace that people are price-shopping on. The prices are generally set, so again, media for the attractions that aren't bookable, and we would expect it to move to transactions for ones that are bookable."

So to tackle the first question, Instant Book, and we need all million properties, absolutely, there's an 80-20 rule, and it's kind of always been that case. The beauty of having a meta model going to a transaction model or adding a transaction model means that we have a wonderful way currently, we always have, to monetize all of the hotels that have -- that are e-commerce-enabled, which is a huge percentage and certainly the vast, vast, vast majority of all the page views. So to offer my value proposition to the consumer, hey, find me compare prices, I got it, don't need to change anything. So I get to layer on Instant Booking as the transactional model where we have connectivity, where it works pricing-wise without sort of -- compared to being TripAdvisor as an online travel agency just starting up, only having a limited set of inventory. We're not in that case. We have all the inventory. So to the point of establishing direct connectivity, we have major hotel chains and independents, absolutely, I get to focus our sales effort on the 20% or 30% or 15% that matter the most. We've opened up the platform so that anybody who is connected can sign up because we really never discriminate or preference against the small hotel in the middle of nowhere. If they are connected with an Internet-booking engine to us today, awesome. They get to sign up today, and we'll send them bookings relating to the traffic we have. But the shorter answer to your great question was yes, there's an 80-20 rule that helps us go after the right supply. To the second half of the question, yes.

It actually does -- how am I going to say it. There are a lot of factors that play. So when you have a relationship with a chain, it tends to be at a more global commission rate, and some of those properties might list themselves on an OTA at a rate that the individual property sort of tops up. That can make the CPC that an OTA player will pay us more valuable to us than the direct commission we get from the chain. When the individual property doesn't do that, then the propensity of consumers, some consumers, to choose a supplier direct partner plus the very reasonable commissions that we're getting from our suppliers -- from our clients, yes, it works out. I started my answer by saying it's not quite as simple as that because even within chains, we have -- certainly with independents, we have different levels of content. And by that, I mean room descriptions, rate plans, and I need to caveat the answer by saying all other things being equal, room descriptions being just as good on an OTA site as in our Instant Book, and the pricing being just as good and certainly, the availability. So we look at the equation and say that the limiting factor on us rolling out Instant Book tends to be around, ""Are we giving the consumer a great experience?"" which, in turn, is related to, ""Do we have good room descriptions?"", ""Do we have good rates?"", ""Is the connectivity really working in all of the cases?"" and ""How many intermediaries are there in the connectivity?"" namely, supplier direct relationship being the fewest intermediaries in terms of us being able to match the equivalent meta CPCs."

We're using a survey method to determine the reason why consumers are coming to our site, and it's definitely reflecting positively on the TV channel.

Many consumers will refer to our old meta engine or other meta sites as places they go to book, in part because those aren't places, the other sites, aren't sites that they go to, to read reviews. And so our challenge all along has been, we have so many travelers coming to read reviews, getting them to come back when they're ready to compare book. And whether or not Instant Book is rolled out, in a lot of consumers' mind, we already have that functionality. We need to drive it home that, again, it's not TripAdvisor. It's a review site, while we're certainly extremely proud of our heritage there. It's wonderfully up-funnel. We're the plan, compare and book site.

So I think the best way",298,"Sure. Thanks for your question. We -- there was some FX translation, incremental headwinds that we saw at this past quarter but only about 100 to 200 basis points since our Q1 call. The real impact was around international pricing. So I think the best way to look at that is through our supplemental metrics that we posted on our IR website. You'll see there that revenue growth, by geography, it really highlights the strengths. When you look at a different geographies' year-over-year contribution, North America represented 61% of the growth this past quarter versus 36% in Q2 of 2014. Whereas if you look at EMEA, they contributed only 24% of the growth last quarter compared to 45% last year, and APAC was 7% of the growth this past quarter versus 16% of last year. And it's even larger when you look at it sequentially. North America growth accelerated, while international regions decelerated. So we think the soft currency landscape has had some modest benefit for travelers from the stronger markets, like our U.S. and U.K. markets, as they've been able to increase their buying power. But the opposite is true for travelers outside the U.S. and U.K. for whom overseas travel has gotten a lot more expensive. So we believe this may explain why we continue to see strong demand around the globe up in traffic. Overall traffic stats, globally, were strong, but in Europe and Asia, we're not seeing the revenue growth due to pricing. So we're trying to be cautious and not assuming that any of these trends are going to change over the balance of the year, and that's why we felt it was prudent to lower our guidance expectations to what we're seeing today, both from a pricing standpoint and a translation standpoint."

And therefore, our clients are naturally able to pay more for the leads. So we're riding that trend, which helps us, obviously, a lot as a lot of our traffic is already on the phone, and we know we lose a lot of attribution as that phone traffic makes it over and actually consummates the transaction on the desktop.

So we're certainly in discussions with every partner that you can imagine. I presume we're talking chains and hotel groups. I don't want to set expectations that we'll get all of the rest of the 10 in the next quarter because some of these folks move faster than others. Obviously, Best Western choice moves very quickly. They're in a different luxury class. Marriott was a big win for us. They cover a lot of different types of hotels and are viewed by many as a leader in this space. So that's certainly helped propel a number of discussions, but I remind folks that we don't need 10 out of the top 10 or 20 out of the top 20 to be wonderfully successful with Instant Book. Unlike in OTA, if hotel brand A is not directly connected with us in Instant Book, I still have all of their properties through an OTA, through our own Tingo or getaroom or many of our other OTA partners. So we still have the ability to do an Instant Booking with those folks. The margin may not be as good to us when we go through the intermediary, but we can still offer that service or we choose not to enable Instant Book on that property and our consumer still has the full meta experience. So our ability to roll that out gradual certainly has helped us over time because we were able to roll out Instant Book with only a couple of suppliers. It helps our economics to get more suppliers on board, that's great. But we're not -- there's no requirement. And I don't want to set expectations that once we get 10 out of 10, we would roll out Instant Booking everywhere. It's not at all how I think about the equation."

So if the Europeans, for example, are going to take a trip, they might pick the walking tour versus the helicopter ride. So they're being a little bit more price-sensitive. What we've seen on the hotel side is a decline in pricing, and we've also been able to determine from where our consumers are coming from and the hotels that they're looking at that they do seem to stay intra-Europe. So not going as far away and maybe on shorter stays. So we think the combination of what's going on in the currency has -- and to see overall climate is negatively impacting the consumers."

How can I maximize the traffic I get through all available means?""

One thing that I would call out to you is that the June data is not out yet. So we're now able to take advantage of seeing the first 23 days of July and all of June to come to our conclusion on how we forecast pricing trends for the balance of the year. And the other piece of it is what I had mentioned before, and more specifically of what we've seen as of late, within attractions because we do get to see the complete funnel with attractions, is there's clearly a change in consumer behavior where they're booking low -- lower value towards their attractions. And then in our own traffic log files, we're able to see that the European consumer, in particular, is if they're still traveling, but they are traveling intra-Europe or having shorter stays. I think part of the ADR question as well is the U.S. is traveling, and the stronger currencies are taking advantage of the lower currency areas. But the rest of world, by our numbers, from both the revenue that we saw in Q2 and the data trends into July, make us cautious for the balance of the year."

Our content and community grew quickly. We strengthened our platform. We deepened our relationship with some of the world's largest hotel chains, and we continued to successfully position our brand and our products to delight more users throughout more phases of the travel planning and trip taking. 
Our second quarter financial results were solid despite significant year-over-year currency headwinds. Total revenue grew 25% to $405 million or 35% growth on constant currency. Click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency.
On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million and would've been positive 15% growth in constant currency. We're navigating the near-term landscape with laser focus on executing on our 2-year and 3- to 5-year growth initiatives.
Over the next 2 years, our top priorities are to expand our lead in content and community and to help our travelers not only plan their trip, but to book it as well. We made excellent progress on these goals during the second quarter. 
First, TripAdvisor continues to set the standard in rich user-generated content and global community. Listings grew 23% to 5.2 million businesses. Users are adding content at a record rate of 160 contributions per minute, and we reached more than 0.25 billion reviews and opinions, up 50% from last year. We're helping more users than ever before as we had more than 1.8 billion unique visitors in the first half of 2015. In Q2 alone, we averaged 375 million monthly unique visitors according to our internal logs, up 30% for the second straight quarter. Also, hotel shopper growth remained strong, growing 22%.
We're doing a great job winning the increasingly mobile user as well. Nearly 50% of our traffic visited on mobile devices, and app downloads reached than 215 million. Continuous mobile product innovation is key. In this quarter, we launched our TripAdvisor app for Apple Watch, Samsung Gear and Pebble devices, bringing the power and convenience with TripAdvisor content to wearables. We also rolled out a new iPad app and new travel guides to help more users when they are looking for where to eat and what to do on their trip.
Further, this quarter, we will cross the $100 million annual revenue run rate on phone, a great milestone for our mobile team and for our travel media business.
TripAdvisor remains unmatched as a place for users to plan a trip. Perhaps, more importantly, these milestones speak to an even larger opportunity in front of us to reduce friction, enable more users to plan, compare and book places to stay, things to do and places to eat on TripAdvisor. Though we're still very early days, we built great momentum, thus far, in 2015.
Specifically in hotels, in Q2, we partner with Marriott International and another top 10 global hotel chain for Instant Booking. These are our third and fourth major hotel announcements this year, and we're now working with 6 out of the top 10 global hotel brands. Our Marriott partnership is a great example of what TripAdvisor can deliver as we bring Marriott an attractive global leisure audience and a great way to introduce more travelers to their 4,200 properties across their 19 industry-leading brands.
Additionally, we added Mandarin Oriental, Langham Hospitality and Americinn during the quarter, and since the quarter ended, we further expanded our reach in APAC by partnering with Dorset hotels. We now have more than 60 chains, hotel groups and OTA partners and have grown Instant Booking supply to 235,000 properties or roughly 1/3 of the e-commerce-enabled properties on our site. This is an amazing progress since our beta launch last year. We're also adding more independent hotels under the TripConnect platform through our Instant Booking data. Hotelier feedback continues to be extremely positive, and we look forward to working with many more independent hotels as our efforts there continue to ramp.
Building high-quality hotel supply is a major step towards enabling more users to find the right hotel, pick their room and book on TripAdvisor with confidence. With our growing partner coverage, users will soon be able to book more than half of 5 million rooms offered by the top 10 hotel brands. We like where we are in the rollout, and we're excited to bring this feature to more users and more partners over the coming year.
Even before the feature is live on a more global scale, recent industry surveys show that TripAdvisor's influence in travel is massive and expanding. Last quarter, I mentioned the comScore study that showed 40% of travel researchers who went on to make a travel purchase last summer visited TripAdvisor at least once. A recent Focusrite survey showed that more than 80% of respondents believe that by visiting TripAdvisor, they pick a higher-quality hotel that's better suited for their needs. They feel more confident in their decision and, perhaps, most importantly, they have a better trip.
On the marketing side, our plan, compare and book message is resonating in online and off-line channels, especially through our TV ad campaign. The same Focusrite survey found that a greater percentage of respondents said they are visiting TripAdvisor at least a few times more per year in 2015 versus 2013, which we attribute to our growing value to consumers as well as our increased TV presence. Beyond hotels, the survey found that users are coming to TripAdvisor more frequently when planning where to eat and what to do on their trip. Our 3- to 5-year growth initiative is to further improve the user experience by helping more consumers around the globe find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals to reinforce -- and to reinforce our leadership position in these categories.
Perhaps our biggest opportunity to do this is in attractions. Since opening up the Viator market -- since opening up the Viator business to a marketplace model at the end of March, industry reception has been excellent. Tours and attraction operators see marketplace as a great way to showcase their products in front of the world's largest travel audience. In fact, Viator added nearly double the number of new products in Q2 as compared to all of 2014. Even before the marketplace rolled out, transaction growth has been accelerating as Viator leverages TripAdvisor's consumer marketing strength and global reach.
In restaurants, we're executing aggressively on our organic and inorganic growth strategy. In a little more than 12 months, we have extended our restaurant business into 12 countries. This quarter, we launched TheFork in Portugal, and we also entered Australia by acquiring the talented team from Dimmi. The restaurant network has grown at an amazing rate, and we're seating diners at more than 28,000 restaurants. Also, our restaurant products are perfectly suited for users on the go, and nearly half of TheFork's booking are made via mobile.
In Vacation Rentals, our ongoing shift to a transaction-based model continues to progress nicely. Users can choose from more than 720,000 properties, and we continue to focus on adding more high-quality inventory. We're also in the process of refreshing our Owners Center, creating a simpler, more engaging and unified experience. The financial benefits continue to shape up nicely as transaction revenue accounted for more than 50% of our Q2 Vacation Rentals revenue. We like where we are in our shift to the transaction model as it is beneficial for travelers and homeowners alike.
At greater scale, lease businesses can drive stickiness to our platform, making TripAdvisor an even more indispensable travel companion. They are long-term plays and we are investing to capture a significant opportunity over the next 3 to 5 years.
Near term, our priorities are simple, move fast, scale quickly, drive a better user experience and focus on revenue growth and market share gains.
In summary, we're pleased with our recent traction and how we're successfully positioning the business for the long term.
And now here's Julie."

We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9 point tougher comp, driven by our click-based busines",1011,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9 point tougher comp, driven by our click-based business and our hotel segment as well as our other segment. Note that in constant currency, total revenue growth would have been 35%, up from the 29% constant currency growth in the second quarter last year. Consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million, behind our expectation for flattish growth and would've been positive 15% on a constant-currency basis.
Foreign exchange headwinds have continued to be a persistent challenge since Q4 last year. While our top of funnel, hotel shopper metrics, remained strong, the U.S. dollar strengthened for the third straight quarter. This prolonged soft currency environment has led to weaker pricing outside of our strong U.S. and U.K. markets, which may be impacting international consumers overseas buying power. As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our strong traffic growth, and we're navigating the soft currency landscape with caution as we are more focused on strengthening our business for the long term.
Q2 click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency, driven by 22% hotel shopper growth. This growth decelerated sequentially 7 points on a 12 point tougher comp. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was negative 6% for the quarter. Similar to Q1, absent currency translation headwinds, Q2 revenue per hotel shopper would have been slightly positive.
Display-based revenue grew 8% against a tough year-over-year comp, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds, slightly impacting currency translation and more significantly impacting our partner ad budgets. Our display team continues to deliver great value to our clients, leveraging our unique scale and robust data management platform to deliver unique insights, offer breadth of products and enhance targeting capabilities. These attributes improve campaign performance that rivals all competitors.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue growth accelerated 94% for the quarter, driven by contributions from prior year attractions and restaurant acquisitions as well as by continued traction from our ongoing shift to a transaction-based Vacation Rentals business. Note that we lap our Viator acquisition in Q3, at which point, we expect growth to normalize.
From a segment perspective, our core hotel segment posted 13% revenue growth or 22% in constant currency with 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in television advertising to amplify our plan, compare and book consumer message. We are seeing very positive results from this new campaign, and it is part of our 2-year initiative to educate more consumers to come to TripAdvisor to plan, compare and book. This investment steps up again in Q3 before stepping back down in Q4 due to travel seasonality.
Other segment revenue grew 210% in Q2, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 3% for the quarter as we invest in growth and market share gains as well as from high-revenue seasonality in attractions and Vacation Rentals.
Moving to headcount. We ended Q2 with just over 3,000 employees, up 43%, driven primarily by a prior year attraction and restaurant acquisitions.
As far as taxes, our Q2 GAAP effective tax rate of 29% increased primarily due to changes in full year forecasted geographical mix. We continue to expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%.
We ended Q2 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count would increase by less than 2% by the end of 2015, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances.
We generated $200 million of cash from operations during the second quarter or 49% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million or 6% of revenue, driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $177 million of free cash flow in Q2 or 44% of revenue. CapEx should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue in the back half of the year as we have now taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.
In terms of liquidity, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities increased $104 million during the quarter to $746 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We also had just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan. We were pleased to complete a new $1 billion credit facility this past quarter and drew down on it to retire the outstanding balance of our term loan at a 25 basis point annual savings at our current leverage ratio. Our strong financial position enabled us to continue to be opportunistic on the organic and inorganic investment front as we pursue long-term growth.
Finally, as it relates to guidance, based upon our view into international CPC pricing today, we are tempering our near-term outlook. We now expect 2015 total revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20s and EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits. Our guidance reflects recent business trends and foreign exchange rates as of today and does not assume future positive or negative FX movements. As such, future changes in FX and their related effects on users and partners could positively or negatively impact our outlook.
While we're incrementally cautious about the near term, I want to echo Steve's comments that we're navigating these choppy currency waters and remain laser-focused on what we can control, namely, building great products, improving the user experience and making the necessary investments to make our global platform more valuable over the long term. Our business grew stronger in the second quarter, and we're excited about where we're headed.
We will now open the call up to your questions."

We know that -- this was said by our customers that generally want to book on TripAdvisor, it's more convenient. It's easier on the phone. It's kind of -- lots of reasons why that's a desirable end state. But that compare piece is really quite important to our consumers. And so where a traveler has a preference for a particular supplier, has a preference for a particular OTA, has a preference for a particular booking channel, we'll be at the phone, as in dialing a telephone number. All of that's fine with us. We want to offer that as features, offer that as capabilities, so that the meta business that we currently have, we don't expect is ever going away. In fact, offering that price comparison for the -- in the hotel space is key. So we expect the hotel space to migrate towards transaction. But where I see Vacation Rentals being in the future, I would expect it to be almost all transaction-oriented. I think hotels will remain split for the foreseeable future. In terms of restaurants, really, it's all transaction. In terms of -- well, the restaurants, it's media for restaurants that we don't take reservations on, and then, obviously, transaction on the reservation. And then attraction, there really isn't a marketplace that people are price-shopping on. The prices are generally set, so again, media for the attractions that aren't bookable, and we would expect it to move to transactions for ones that are bookable."

So to tackle the first question, Instant Book, and we need all million properties, absolutely, there's an 80-20 rule, and it's kind of always been that case. The beauty of having a meta model going to a transaction model or adding a transaction model means that we have a wonderful way currently, we always have, to monetize all of the hotels that have -- that are e-commerce-enabled, which is a huge percentage and certainly the vast, vast, vast majority of all the page views. So to offer my value proposition to the consumer, hey, find me compare prices, I got it, don't need to change anything. So I get to layer on Instant Booking as the transactional model where we have connectivity, where it works pricing-wise without sort of -- compared to being TripAdvisor as an online travel agency just starting up, only having a limited set of inventory. We're not in that case. We have all the inventory. So to the point of establishing direct connectivity, we have major hotel chains and independents, absolutely, I get to focus our sales effort on the 20% or 30% or 15% that matter the most. We've opened up the platform so that anybody who is connected can sign up because we really never discriminate or preference against the small hotel in the middle of nowhere. If they are connected with an Internet-booking engine to us today, awesome. They get to sign up today, and we'll send them bookings relating to the traffic we have. But the shorter answer to your great question was yes, there's an 80-20 rule that helps us go after the right supply. To the second half of the question, yes.

It actually does -- how am I going to say it. There are a lot of factors at play. So when you have a relationship with a chain, it tends to be at a more global commission rate, and some of those properties might list themselves on an OTA at a rate that the individual property sort of tops up. That can make the CPC that an OTA player will pay us more valuable to us than the direct commission we get from the chain. When the individual property doesn't do that, then the propensity of consumers, some consumers, to choose a supplier direct partner plus the very reasonable commissions that we're getting from our suppliers -- from our clients, yes, it works out. I started my answer by saying it's not quite as simple as that because even within chains, we have -- certainly with independents, we have different levels of content. And by that, I mean room descriptions, rate plans, and I need to caveat the answer by saying all other things being equal, room descriptions being just as good on an OTA site as in our Instant Book, and the pricing being just as good and certainly, the availability. So we look at the equation and say that the limiting factor on us rolling out Instant Book tends to be around, ""Are we giving the consumer a great experience?"" which, in turn, is related to, ""Do we have good room descriptions?"", ""Do we have good rates?"", ""Is the connectivity really working in all the cases?"" and ""How many intermediaries are there in the connectivity?"" namely, supplier direct relationship being the fewest intermediaries in terms of us being able to match the equivalent meta CPCs."

We -- there was some FX translation, incremental headwinds that we saw at this past quarter but only about 100 to 200 basis points since our Q1 call. The real impact was around international pricing. So I think the best way to look at that is through our supplemental metrics that we posted on our IR website. You'll see there that revenue growth, by geography, it really highlights the strengths. When you look at a different geographies' year-over-year contribution, North America represented 61% of the growth this past quarter versus 36% in Q2 of 2014. Whereas, you look at EMEA, they contributed only 24% of the growth last quarter compared to 45% last year, and APAC was 7% of the growth this past quarter versus 16% of last year. And it's even larger when you look at it sequentially. North America growth accelerated, while international regions decelerated. So we think the soft currency landscape has had some modest benefit for travelers from the stronger markets, like our U.S. and U.K. markets, as they've been able to increase their buying power. But the opposite is true for travelers outside the U.S. and U.K. for whom overseas travel has gotten a lot more expensive. So we believe this may explain why we continue to see strong demand around the globe up in traffic. Overall traffic stats, globally, were strong, but in Europe and Asia, we're not seeing the revenue growth due to pricing. So we're trying to be cautious and not assuming that any of these trends are going to change over the balance of the year, and that's why we felt it was prudent to lower our guidance expectations to what we're seeing today, both from a pricing standpoint and a translation standpoint."

They're in a different luxury class. Marriott was a big win for us. They cover a lot of different types of hotels and are viewed by many as a leader in this space. So that's certainly helped propel a number of discussions, but I remind folks that we don't need 10 out of the top 10 or 20 out of the top 20 to be wonderfully successful with Instant Book. Unlike in OTA, if hotel brand A is not directly connected with us in Instant Book, I still have all of their properties through an OTA, through our own Tingo or getaroom or many of our other OTA partners. So we still have the ability to do an Instant Booking with those folks. The margin may not be as good to us when we go through the intermediary, but we can still offer that service or we choose not to enable Instant Book on that property and our consumer still has the full meta experience. So our ability to roll that out gradual certainly has helped us over time because we were able to roll out Instant Book with only a couple of suppliers. It helps our economics to get more suppliers on board, that's great. But we're not -- there's no requirement. And I don't want to set expectations that once we get 10 out of 10, we would roll out Instant Booking everywhere. It's not at all how I think about the equation."

So the -- let me just start with what we do have full visibility to -- is that up on the attraction side where we have seen -- because we see the full transaction compared to hotels where we don't necessarily know the downstream conversions. But we have seen within attractions that the 3 quarters of strengthening dollar has negatively impacted the average order value. So if the Europeans, for example, are going to take a trip, they might pick the walking tour versus the helicopter ride. So they're being a little bit more price-sensitive. What we've seen on the hotel side is a decline in pricing, and we've also been able to determine from where our consumers are coming from and the hotels that they're looking at that they do seem to stay intra-Europe. So not going as far away and maybe on shorter stays. So we think the combination of what's going on in the currency has -- and just the overall climate is negatively impacting the consumers."

To my knowledge, I don't think when an Instant Book client goes live, I don't think it affects their CPC spend at all. I don't think they look at it that way, frankly. So I'm not surprised by that as a result. The hotel chain or the independent looks at TripAdvisor and says, ""There's a lot of traffic in there. Awesome. How can I maximize the traffic I get through all available means?"" And for a chain, one answer is, ""Well, I'm going to buy a Business Listing because some percent of the folks really want to click on the link and come over direct to my website to explore more. Some want to call the phone number."" That's part of what the Business Listing offers, subscription fee. And other folks say, hey, they don't want to try that book on TripAdvisor thing. They just want to click on the meta link like I've been doing for the past umpteen years, so they keep that by there. And then the ones that are connected get to go for the Instant Booking. So we talk to the hotels, and I think they look at it as sort of 3 bites at the traveler. And they're able to maximize the number of bookings they're getting in their mind directly from TripAdvisor, and that's a good thing. I don't -- and I think if you put yourself in the shoes of a hotelier, that makes sense because they're measuring each of these channels independently, and they're all profitable for them. So why not go for as much as you can get."

And the other piece of it is what I had mentioned before, and more specifically of what we've seen as of late, within attractions because we do get to be the complete funnel with attractions, is there's clearly a change in consumer behavior where they're booking low -- lower value towards their attractions. And then in our own traffic log files, we're able to see that the European consumer, in particular, is they're still traveling, but they are traveling intra-Europe or having shorter stays. I think part of the ADR question as well is the U.S. is traveling, and the stronger currencies are taking advantage of the lower currency areas.

The Q3 results clearly show the major impact currency headwinds are having on our business. Total revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% or 25% and 26% growth, respectively, in constant currency. As I'll describe in more detail later in my remarks, our results and business outlook also highlight that we're moving quickly in pursuit of our long-term goals to make TripAdvisor a great place to discover and book the things that make a trip memorable. 
First, we'll talk about how TripAdvisor's consumer value proposition continues to strengthen and content, community and mobile. In content, with 290 million reviews and opinions on 5.3 million businesses around the world, TripAdvisor products are indispensable travel planning tools. Member growth has accelerated this year and those members are contributing content at a record pace of 190 per minute, the fastest growth in our history. This puts us on track to add another 100 million reviews and opinions over the next 12 months, making our travel planning products and tools fresher, richer and better for every user on every device in every geography. 
Our global travel community also continues to grow as evidenced by unique monthly visitor growth of 23% and hotel shopper growth of 16%. Travelers can find information on more than 3.6 million restaurants and attractions, so it's no surprise that unique visitors to these pages continues to grow quickly. We attribute much of this growth in engagement to mobile, where TripAdvisor's helpful reviews, tips, photos and guides are the perfect travel companion. Mobile usage picks up more than half of our traffic. In this quarter, we reached more than 230 million app downloads across our brands including 215 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We're monetizing better on that platform as well as this quarter's hotel shoppers on phone monetized a 25% rate than those on desktop, which is up nearly 40% since 2 years ago. Perhaps, more importantly, this speaks to the large mobile monetization opportunity in front of us. Those give us another powerful way to connect directly with consumers. Continuous iteration and the innovation here is key and every TripAdvisor team is actively engaged in delivering more value to users and partners on these devices. 
On any device, TripAdvisor users are close to making a purchase. In fact, the recent Oxford economic study estimates that TripAdvisor influenced more than 10% of global travel transactions in 2014, whether it's a hotel stay for a long weekend, a reservation for 2 at a hot new restaurant or tickets for a hop-on hop-off city tour, these are extremely powerful moment for advertisers as travel purchases tend to be extremely nuanced, contextual and episodic. TripAdvisor delivers the right ad or the right reservation opportunity to the right user at just the right moment at massive global scale. 
As proud as we are in this growing influence, we believe that our revenue share represents only a small percentage of the transaction value we are driving for our partners. We are in year 1 of a multiyear [indiscernible] club monetization link, and we continue to make excellent progress. In hotels, [indiscernible] hotel group and the Priceline Group are the latest of a growing list of more than 70 hotel chains, groups and OTA partners who want the power bookings on our platform including 7 of the top 10 brands -- top 10 hotel brands in the world. 
In addition -- in particular, adding the Priceline Group to the platform is a huge win for our travelers as their high-quality room descriptions in many languages, multicurrency [indiscernible] and capabilities, great room pricing and stellar customer service enables us to accelerate our international rollout with Instant Booking over the coming year. We expect to launch the booking.com brand first, with the Priceline and Agoda brands to follow next year. Integration work is already begun and I can tell you that I love what I'm seeing. And once we are fully alive, we expect users will be able to seamlessly book more than 400,000 properties on our platform in more than a dozen languages. 
We're also helping independent hoteliers to drive more bookings on our platform. We're working with more than 130 Internet booking engine partners, and we expect to connect many of their hotel clients over time. Regardless of the partner size or global reach, Instant Booking can drive reservations at a fair cost, solve the media attribution issues that have persisted within the Internet for years and enable our hotelier plans to develop more direct relationships to more travelers. 
Our Marriott integration serves as a perfect example. After the signing contract in June, we completed the rollout in less than 2 months, where we've seen great early results including an improved conversion and more bookings for Marriott through our platform. As we add more globally recognized partners, we are further optimizing the bookings on our site as well. This includes developing our own content management system for hotels and saving user's credit card information to make bookings faster and easier. A [indiscernible] the entire Instant Booking team has met this challenge head-on for meaningful conversion improvements over the past year. Based upon these improvements, and given how important Instant Booking is to our long-term goals, we accelerated the rollout to our users in 2 of our largest market in September. We believe that accelerated rollouts scheduled contributed headwinds of approximately $10 million to revenue and $8 million to EBITDA during Q3. We expect to be live in more major markets in the next year and we'll continue to carefully monitor the opportunity costs associated with this faster international rollout. We know the Instant Book experience is working for users and partners. 
The third piece of the puzzle is monetization for TripAdvisor. While net yet accretive, we believe that the faster we transition and teach travelers that they can book on TripAdvisor, the quicker we can plug the monetization link. Fortunately, we have extremely smart and motivated teams who are up to the challenge. We've successfully transitioned away from pop-up windows to successfully transitioning to metasearch and I know that we will tackle this transition just as well.
On the marketing side, we're continuing to more deeply integrate the plan of comparing book message into our online and offline channels. The [indiscernible] channel for this past year has been TV. While we've seen success in many countries and we're pleased with our TV efforts over the past couple of years, we've decided to put this marketing channel on pause for 2016 while we focus more on the global rollout of Instant Booking. Instead, we expect to increase our investment in some of our other global brand-building efforts where we also better leverage our community, both on the consumer and B2B side to fuel our book on TripAdvisor initiatives.
In addition to our opportunity in hotels, we're matching more consumers and businesses in our fast-growing attractions, restaurants and Vacation Rentals categories. Our content community gives us the unique understanding of travelers especially in attractions and restaurants where we can link more users at the exact moment that they're looking [indiscernible] great place to eat or memorable things to do. These businesses [indiscernible] to our other segment, which generated revenues of $75 million in the third quarter and $217 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over that time frame, we've been aggressively reinvesting profits to drive market share gains. We are just in the first year of what we have outlined as a 3- to 5-year growth initiatives.
Shifting gears, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, the team and I are looking forward to welcoming Ernst Teunissen to TripAdvisor. Ernst brings significant financial and operational expertise as a global CFO and corporate strategist, and I look forward to collaborating with him as we pursue the significant growth opportunities ahead. He officially starts next week, and Julie will be with us until November 20 to ensure a smooth transition. 
Before I close, 2015 is obviously a tremendous year for our TripAdvisor initiatives. While still in the early days of this evolution, we continue to make tremendous strides towards our long-term growth objectives.
In closing, this is Julie's final earnings call with us, and I want to thank her again for all her contributions over the past 4 years. I'd also like to thank all of our employees around the globe who build the products that users love and more valuable platform for advertisers, positioning TripAdvisor for long-term success. 
And now here's Julie."

This quarter, total revenue grew 17%. Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 9%. In constant currency, Q3 total revenue and EBITDA growth would have been 25% and 26%, respectively. 
Our core hotel segment posted 8% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, and EBITDA margin is held stable at 36%. Digging in, Q3 click-based revenue grew 6% or 14% in constant currency driven by 16% hotel shopper growth and offset by continued pricing pressure, which includes impact from currency translation, lower CPC pricing and product changes we've made such as the decision to accelerate our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and U.K., our 2 largest markets. Revenue per hotel shopper growth reflects these headwinds as it decelerated to negative 10%. Normalizing for the significant year-over-year currency translation headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would've been better, though still slightly negative for the quarter due to a lower CPC pricing and the accelerated Instant Book rollout.
As a housekeeping item, note, that during the third quarter, we improved our accounting methodology for unique users and hotel shoppers and have provided the recasted [ph] figures back through 2014 in the supplemental financial information tables, which are available on our IR site. 
Our display base business performed very well as revenue growth reaccelerated to 20%. These strong results were driven by 22% growth in ad impressions sold and we saw strength in the U.S. and EMEA markets with hotels, destination marketing organization and OTA customers in particular. Our display team continues to innovate this product offering, delivering great value to clients. As the currency environment stabilize, we expect that more clients will be in a position to leverage our scale and robust data management platform in their global ad campaigns.
Other segment revenue grew 92% in Q3, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins improved to positive 12% for the quarter, driven by higher revenue seasonality in our attraction and Vacation Rental businesses. We've operated this segment at EBITDA breakeven over the trailing 12 months and continue to reinvest aggressively in our products and sales efforts to drive long-term market share gains. We expect to see the typical seasonal step-down in Q4, and Q3 results, while strong, should not be taken as a new run rate in the near term. Over the long term, we believe margins will expand as we gain greater global scale.
As for expenses, selling and marketing delevered primarily due to top line impacts from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout and increased investments in our other segment businesses. We also had a full quarter of expenses related to our 2014 attraction acquisition last year, and we continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing resources to pursue our long-term growth objectives in our newer categories.
I'll note that the quarter also contains approximately $20 million in television advertising spend, which was consistent with both our Q2 investment as well as the year-ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, we've decided to put this investment on pause in 2016 and intend to expand our investment in other brand marketing channels as we roll out Instant Book more broadly. On the other expense line, general and administrative expenses levered slightly and [indiscernible] content grew in line with revenue as we continue to actively seek talent to pursue our growth initiatives.
On the bottom line, GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.51, which included the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries which contributed $0.12 to our GAAP diluted EPS this quarter. This gain on sale was not included in our non-GAAP net income result of $0.53 per diluted share as the gain is not considered indicative of our ongoing operational results.
Moving to headcount. We ended Q3 with approximately 3,000 employees, up 9%, driven primarily by the investments we're making to grow our attraction and restaurant businesses. As for taxes, our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate is 25%, decreased primarily due to the changes in full year forecasted geographical mix including a nontaxable gain related to the sale of [indiscernible], one of our Chinese subsidiaries. We continue to expect GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 27% to 28%.
We generated $8 million of cash from operations during the quarter or 2% of revenue. This line continues to highlight the growth and seasonality of our transaction businesses, where we collect cash at the time of booking and payout to suppliers at the time of stay or when the ticket is used. CapEx for the quarter was $39 million or 9% of revenue, driven primarily by leasehold improvements, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth. CapEx should step down significantly as a percentage of revenue moving forward now that we have taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. We now expect 2015 capital expenditures to be 7% of revenue. We continue to run a very capital-efficient business.
Liquidity remains strong as well with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balance of $730 million. We also have an undrawn balance of $708 million from our $1 billion credit facility and just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged as we look to be opportunistic when it comes to making organic and inorganic discretionary growth investments. Online travel remains competitive, and we tend to view investments through a long-term lens versus near-term payback.
Looking forward, Q4 will have a full quarter impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout and we expect to begin onboarding booking.com later this quarter. As such, we now expect 2015 revenue growth in the high teens and slightly negative EBITDA growth. This revised outlook attempts to be appropriately conservative to reflect these changes as well as the foreign exchange rates as of today. This outlook does not assume future positive or negative FX movements, conversion or monetization improvements.
We expect to roll out Instant Booking faster over the coming periods, which is great for our travelers and our long-term business prospects as we begin to plug the monetization link. Over the near term, it poses some forecasting challenges as we enable more properties roll out to many users around the globe and continue to improve the monetization of the product. As Ernst settles in over the coming months, the team will determine how to evolve communication on future expectations as well as the metrics by which progress will be measured.
The business is heading in the right direction, and I've enjoyed being part of the journey. I want to personally thank Steve and the entire TripAdvisor team for a great 4 years. We will now open the call up to your questions."

So the arc conversion improvement, I would say, has been fairly steady since we launched over a year ago. Month in month out, sometimes week in, week out, we're just making a constant, constant improvement. I note, heads up, coming up is kind of step change because we're adding Priceline. Super excited about this deal with the Priceline Group because they offer a great brand, global inventory, tremendous content kind of rich. And I talked about this several times in the past, very rich descriptions and a lot of the information that our travelers are telling us, they want to see on our site before they hit the book button. And at that times, they have to leave our site even when they've gone into the Instant Booking flow because we haven't been able to provide everything that the customers are looking for. Booking.com or Expedia, for that matter, have tremendous constantly been able to provide that information. That's why the conversion rates on their sites as good as they are. This deal allows us to bring in that rich information into our Instant Booking flow, and so we don't know the impact on the conversion rate, and we'll know shortly as we roll it out, but that's really going to be a big difference maker in terms of -- if the slow and steady improvement that we've made have come potential step change when we launch with Priceline Group. Having said that, we faced the choice last year in looking -- for this past year, in looking look at the international rollout because it's been a challenge for us to figure out how to get the content that we need in all the languages and support all the currency types. All of a sudden, that challenge is addressed for us by this Priceline deal and so it makes just technically or practically feasible to roll it out. It adds additional uncertainty in our forecasting because while we have a decent amount of experience now in U.S. and U.K., we don't quite know how Instant Book is going to be flowing in, in France, in Japan, all throughout Asia, all throughout all the other markets that we look to roll it out in. Priceline has great content. The partnership will work in all the countries, but we don't know the conversion impact relative to the meta prices that we have. Coming back up another level, we're really excited about what this does for the business. We've always said that we're ready to go it alone without an OTA partner because it was the right thing for the business. That was true. Having Priceline in the fold now just allows us to be able to go faster on the fact that we're headed down anyway. And that faster has always been pretty important to for us. It is a big transition as we've gone through several in the past, we're looking forward to not only the week-by-week improvement, but the step change function that we hope this Priceline deal will deliver. To the second part of your question, television, one of the reasons that we wanted to talk about television on this call is that TV is often a long term -- it's an advanced buy. It's something that you need to plan in advance. And so while we're telling folks that we've decided to pull back, for 2016 at least, we don't want anyone to think that, hey, we're just taking all that money and hanging on to it. We will be attempting -- we will be spending some of the money in other channels, and so we don't want anyone's model to just drop it to the bottom line. We haven't decided how much, and of course, all throughout the year, we will be evaluating opportunities as they come up with TV such a long-term commitment, we have enough visibility into that specific decision."

And if we can do that and if we can monetize those hotel shoppers to the degree that any other OTA monetizes the hotel shoppers, that's a really big win for us. And while TV was then to help that, we feel we actually already have the traveler on our site. And by doing all other things on our site, we can also affect that plug the leak. We also have the entire global world to look at, and so an extremely global TV educational campaign is hundreds of millions of dollars, but we already have the traffic that's live, and with the Priceline Group and our ability to roll out Instant Book globally, we want to sort of concentrate our firepower on delivering that compare book message, plugging that leak after travelers are already on our site."

We do think about those questions [indiscernible] with quite a bit of course. The reason Priceline enables us to accelerate our Instant Book rollout globally is because of the rich content that they have on 400,000-plus properties all around the globe, and by that, I mean if they're able to successfully take bookings on 400,000-plus properties in multiple, multiple different languages, processing payments for multiple different credit cards issued by multiple different banks, all sorts of things because they're such a strong sort of global hotel reservation player like Expedia. So I'm not saying that they're different there and simply saying, they already have the ability for someone that lives in France or in Japan. They come to their site to see the inventory that a traveler wants to stay and see all the room descriptions in the local language, make the bookings, using the local credit cards, and we didn't have any of that for that customer in Japan, for instance, on TripAdvisor today. So if I were to roll out TripAdvisor today, I would be showing an Instant Book experience in English to that Japanese traveler. I would be showing a room description for a Marriott property in English for that -- Marriott might be a bad example because we might have Japanese content, but an independent hotel or independent brand, we would be showing content in the wrong language to make it a highly converting experience. Priceline gives us all of that in one fell swoop and it's highly strong curated content payments and breadth of inventory. That allows us to push faster in IB. We hope for an improved conversion rate, travelers on our site going through that funnel because the experience is better. And so when we look -- we will know shortly enough whether or not that yields or higher net revenue all the way to being accretive for us as we roll out Instant Book. I'm not sure being plus or minus slightly accretive or slightly negative is going to influence the timing of the rollout. Per my earlier comments of we know this is the right thing to do for the traveler. We know this is the right thing to do for long-term direction of TripAdvisor. We always stated we're willing to take some short-term hits along the way if it gets us to where we want to be, and we have 18 months of history where we have improved our conversion quarter after quarter after quarter so that we're confident. Hey, we're always going to be making progress, we may not always be as fast as or may not always be instantly but we'll get there, and that's what gives us confidence in the Instant Book rollout even though it is not sort of instantly accretive. Hope that helped."

So we always try to present you the most accurate metrics that we have. We recast them to see year on-year over the past period. It obviously has no impact on revenue. We're scraping out -- we're filtering out traffic that wasn't real. So it's a housekeeping  footnote. You'll see the stuff has changed.

When we look at the macro issues in our past Q3, we're really pointing at Instant Book, the accelerated rollout, right long-term decisions, short term, a small amount of pain that we're certainly willing to take. And then we're looking at -- as we go forward, I mean, there is some pricing headwind that we see in our standard meta business, and it's a meta business, it's an auction. We don't set the price. Our clients bid up, bid down. There's more consolidation on the global space. There's a ton of different trends, not to mention currency, going on. And at the end of the day, we believe our leads are just qualified. So even if there's a bit of a pricing it, it's not something that we can influence. But we can influence and really what we're focused on is making IB as successful as it can be going forward, and that's why to double down where we're even more excited about the Priceline deal and it's our ability to roll it out even quicker."

Hotel shoppers can certainly expect to continue to grow but at 16% or not, terribly disappointed at that."

We have given a couple of nuggets on 2016, one, that we're pulling down and pausing TV, but we do expect to reinvest back into other channels. Q4, we're also seeing the full year of the Instant Booking headwind, which, as a team, is working actively to optimize and make that accretive with every expectation that, that would continue into 2016. And in addition to the monetization headwinds, there is a slight shift in the way revenue is recognized. So with the majority of our click-based revenue today, we recognize revenue on click immediately. As Instant Book becomes a more meaningful amount of revenue will be experienced this shift because with Instant Book, the majority of our large partners, including the Priceline Group, we will be recognizing revenue on stay. So there'll be some seasonality and a shift in revenue as that becomes a more meaningful number. So that's something else to take into consideration in evaluating 2016. We're in a process of doing that ourselves, looking at booking windows and consumer behavior, and we'll make an estimate into our 2016 plan."

So I will know whether there are any changes in the display or the participation in meta by Priceline Group. Once that thing can actually roll out, I'm not under any impression that being in Instant Book would change anyone's participation in meta, let alone the Priceline Group. They've always expressed to us, as every client has, that they like as many transactions through our platform as possible. So I certainly would encourage you to ask the Priceline Group themselves, but my interpretation would be they are eager for all the traffic that they can get in meta just like they have in all the years past. They've been a phenomenal partner for us for many years and they're excited about their new transactions we'll be delivering to the Instant Book path. So it's kind of additive, and I think that's how the discussions have always been based, that it's additive to -- they're thinking of how to maximize their participation in the TripAdvisor channel. To the second part of the question, which marketing channels are most efficient, we tend to look for as many marketing channels as we can find that deliver sort of quality traffic, and for the most part, we operate them on a breakeven basis. We view it as acquiring trial, and I'm talking about some sort of ROI generating online channel, [indiscernible] targeting or CPM or any of the other methods of acquiring -- methods of acquiring the traffic. Other marketing channels that we'll be working on offline, so many of them, it's nearly impossible to measure. We do quite a bit amount of ER. We do a fair amount of content licensing. We do a fair amount of other -- of engaging in various markets in -- by leveraging our B2B or B2C community. None of those have a direct ROI, but we spend serious dollars in them. And I think that's one of the reasons why if you're ever traveling, you're likely to see something branded TripAdvisor along the way and the TripAdvisor rating, and we love all that. We don't even try to measure the marketing efficiency of those campaigns."

I know you can't about [indiscernible] or other deals or the terms, but how long might that take for an auction there to become a reality? And then just secondly, I think maybe one of the reasons why your partners get comfortable with Instant Book, and correct me if I'm wrong, is because they get to [indiscernible] the brand and the actual booking process, I assume because it can run itself to repeat customer economics over time. Obviously, that booking is being made through trips. What can you tell us so far about which product might be [indiscernible] benefit of these repeat economics over time?"

So as part of the sign-up process for an independent hotel on the website, there's 2 commission rates, the 12% and 15%. Then we offer the hotel sort of a guaranteed share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, what we call, eligible impression so of the folks visiting their page basically. It's part of our sort of sales pitch that if you sign up, this is what we promise you. It can well be a lot more than that depending on a lot of different factors. And so going forward, that independent who has signed up, even at a 15% commission, TripAdvisor has -- once the booking.com deal is live as -- or even today with our current OTA partners, we make a choice that one time that is beyond that share guarantee, do I wish to show get a room as an OTA for that hotel or if the hotel itself or contango as an OTA for that hotel. For any particular property, I might already have 3 or more auction -- 3 or more participants in Instant Book. We make the decision based on who to show. Once the share guarantees the net, we make the decision based upon what we think is going to be the best answer for the consumer because that's usually going to be the best answer for TripAdvisor. What I mean is we have to evaluate how good the content is, the quality of the room descriptions because the consumer wants to see that in order to hit the book button. We also care a lot about the price. And so whoever has the cheaper price is also going to have a higher conversion rate on our site. And then finally, if the the commission does come into play, you can imagine an extreme of somebody offering to pay a ridiculous 20% commission for a property while somebody else is offering to pay a 12%. If all other things are equal, then TripAdvisor is going to pick the 20% commission. That kind of maximizes us and there's no harm to the consumer because, as I said, all the other aspects of the flow were equivalent. With the current OTAs, with Priceline, with the brands that we have with the Priceline Group and eventually multiple brands from the Priceline Group, I think we have quite a choice as to who can fulfill the offer, and we'll look at it from mostly what's the best experience for the consumer and, secondarily, who has a good commission to us. You should interpret that as at end of the day, that combination is probably going to maximize TripAdvisor's revenue because I care the most about how many people are booking. And if I make a little bit less commission per booking but more people convert, we're going to make more money. Consumers are going to be happier and that's the path we're looking for. To the second part of the question, sort of who -- if I understand correctly, who gets the benefit of the brand placement in the booking flow, it's a bit, from our perspective, it's too early to tell. We just haven't been in the marketplace long enough on the [indiscernible] of our platforms in order to see who might get, and I'm not even sure how carefully I can measure, but I'm not sure who's going to get that second booking, the second trip, which tends not to happen the next day or even the next week. So we want to be very clear with all of our partners, and certainly, our travelers, that it's get a room, whether it's booking.com that is powering for Marriott, that is powering this transaction. They are the folks that you're going to go to when you want to make a change. There'll be -- Marriott is the owner of the property. They can answer the question faster than we can if the traveler has one. And if it's a second time booking for a similar property, we're certainly okay if that ends up being supplier direct. Our biggest opportunity is the traveler who comes our site, enjoys the reviews, sees the room tips, looks at a dozen different candid photos, and says yes, this is the property I'm looking for. I like the price. Maybe I go down the Instant Book flow, I select the type of room, but I'm not ready to book right now and the next day or later in the week. When they're sure they want to take that trip, surely want to stay in that property, they come back to TripAdvisor to finish the booking. And if we can close that leap just that one piece of that plug leak, phenomenal huge win on TripAdvisor even if the partner that powers the transaction, the Marriott or the Priceline, wins the second booking because they have a great remarketing or retargeting campaign. Getting that first booking for us is -- obviously, I want both but getting that first booking for us by changing the mindset of the traveler, that's the biggest way that we see over the next couple of years."

So I don't -- I wouldn't claim yet that I have an answer as to how we can quickly change consumers' line sets. I look back and say, TripAdvisor hasn't really had an awareness issue in most of our markets. TV does a great job growing awareness, so we see how it's worked for so many other companies. But the other companies have tended to be at a different awareness stage or different growth stage, and so we went forward with TV knowing that it wasn't to move our awareness numbers but to educate folks on that one click now book now on TripAdvisor. And it's been -- we did surveys on the TV, and certainly, the book message stood out. But it was harder to see the behavior change on TripAdvisor. We saw more traffic. We made more money but it was softer to draw the conclusion that it got people to actually complete a transaction to book on TripAdvisor. So there would be, in my mind, no harm whatsoever in taking away TV campaign that has the same message or likely creative but the same or different creative, nothing wrong with that. It couldn't possibly hurt. But in the judgment call on all of is that where we want to push on our branding and marketing for next year, we made that judgment call, because it has to make this one in advance and that says, we're going to pause. We use the word was carefully because I'm not saying we wouldn't change our mind. We wouldn't do something else in 2017 or maybe in the late 2016, but the notion is that's not -- it's a big dollar bet and that's not what we're going to spend those dollars on in '16. When we look at it from value of 100-plus million travelers on the site in a month, 150 million or 175 million, surely, that's a big enough sample size to work on the educational message. And recently, we've been doing quite a bit on that. So if you go to the site, many of our devices, not all, you'll see a much stronger -- you can book on TripAdvisor and buying with the appearance of a book on TripAdvisor button where hundreds of thousands or more of properties, plus the global rollout plus [indiscernible] on other brand communication, better different/cheaper than TV, we think that there's, as our judgment call, something kind of wrong with the TV, but we think we can achieve our goals better in terms training book by spending our time and some of our dollars elsewhere."

Priceline and Expedia were the 2 notable ones that have declined.

We are perfectly happy with that. They get to growing transactions from our platform. And we quarters, get the Instant Book rolling out globally. We get the improved content from our display and, hopefully, the improved version that comes with it. We can continue to show other OTAs and other suppliers in our stores. We look forward to the remaining hotel brands joining in Instant Book. We look forward to having more Instant Book options across the board. We continue to sign up independent hotels at a decent pace. We're building our own content management system, as I mentioned, to make sure those properties are represented on our site with excellent content and strong pricing, and it's like what we've done with the meta. We're building a really strong marketplace globally for lots of different folks, hotels or the intermediaries, to be able to power the bookings or folks that choose to book on TripAdvisor. I take the opportunity to talk about Instant Booking and meta and I will always refer to it as Instant Booking and meta. We love our Instant Book strategy. We talk about it over and over, but I don't want anyone to think that meta is going away. Our messaging of plan, compare and book plan, that's the reviews. The content that's a great decision support information that we have in order to help the consumer find exactly where they want to go, where they want to stay, what they want to do to have a great trip, that's the plan message. The compare is everyone is looking for the best price. Showing a price on TripAdvisor and Instant Booking is one of the options and showing the price that is available elsewhere on the Web from one of the other players that the travelers are aware of is part of that core compare message, and we expect to have that compare message for the forever future. It's just part of our core positioning and plan, compare and book. And we want TripAdvisor Instant Booking to offer a great price, terrific content, the trusted brand of TripAdvisor as to why you should click in, see the content and the brand provided by what we're actually doing, powering the booking for us, the hotel itself or the high-quality travel agent like Priceline or any of the other OTAs that are in store and they kind of complete that part of the purchase and the rest of the TripAdvisor value proposition we're still very excited about but we classify into other businesses the attractions in the restaurants and the other ways that are going to make a trip incredibly powerful, but it's Instant Booking and meta as that core monetization vehicle for hotels. It's restaurants and attractions and other services in the -- on the trip piece, Vacation Rentals and alternative lodging in general that helps people [indiscernible] and if the hotel isn't quite what we're looking for, we have these other options, whether it'd be urban inventory that we're sourcing through our Vacation Rental, standard alternative lodging like the traditional Vacation Rental, those are all part of our store. And it's our job to -- our challenge, our opportunity to present them at the right time to the travelers that are on our site. All in all, it's a pretty complete picture. It doesn't have everything, but when we look at the things that travelers are most interested, we have -- we would like to think the best offering in the plan space. We have a great offering in the compare space. We're learning how to have the best offering in the book space. We don't have it yet, but we're getting there, and we have the best offering in the in-destination market or attractions and restaurants globally. So that's a pretty good coverage of that life cycle, and I guess the question started with Priceline, and so Priceline really helped us deliver on that book component. Thanks for the question.
All right. With that, I think we're out of time. So let me say, thank you very much. We're moving fast. We're making great progress on these long-term goals, and I have to say, I'm really fortunate to have a great team on the job. So to all of our employees throughout the entire TripAdvisor family, thank you again and again, for your terrific work, for your hard work. It's showing results.

I'm going to update you on our progress on how we're developing the best products for users, expanding our strong global platform to more partners and building a bigger and better business over the long term.
The Q3 results clearly show the major impact currency headwinds are having on the business. Total revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% or 25% and 26% growth, respectively, in constant currency. As I'll describe in more detail later in my remarks, our results and business outlook also highlight that we were moving quickly in pursuit of our long-term goals to make TripAdvisor a great place to discover and book the things that make a trip memorable.
First, we'll talk about how TripAdvisor's consumer value proposition continues to strengthen in content, community and mobile. In content, with 290 million reviews and opinions on 5.3 million businesses around the world, TripAdvisor products are indispensable travel planning tools. Member growth has accelerated this year and those members are contributing content at a record pace of 190 per minute, the fastest growth in our history. This puts us on track to add another 100 million reviews and opinions over the next 12 months, making our travel planning products and tools fresher, richer and better for every user on every device in every geography.
Our global travel community also continues to grow as evidenced by unique monthly visitor growth of 23% and hotel shopper growth of 16%. Travelers can find information on more than 3.6 million restaurants and attractions, so it's no surprise that unique visitors to these pages continues to grow quickly. We attribute much of this growth in engagement to mobile, where TripAdvisor's helpful reviews, tips, photos and guides are the perfect travel companion.
Mobile usage picks up more than half of our traffic. In this quarter, we reached more than 230 million app downloads across our brands, including 215 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We're monetizing better on that platform as well as this quarter's hotel shoppers on phone monetized a 25% of the rate than those on desktop, which is up nearly 40% since 2 years ago.
Perhaps more importantly, this speaks to the large mobile monetization opportunity in front of us. Mobile give us yet another powerful way to connect directly with consumers. Continuous iteration and the innovation here is key and every TripAdvisor team is actively engaged in delivering more value to users and partners on these devices.
On any device, TripAdvisor users are close to making a purchase. In fact, the recent Oxford economic study estimates that TripAdvisor influenced more than 10% of global travel transactions in 2014, whether it's a hotel stay for a long weekend, a reservation for 2 at a hot new restaurant or tickets for a hop-on hop-off city tour, these are extremely powerful moments for advertisers as travel purchases tend to be extremely nuanced, contextual and episodic. TripAdvisor delivers the right ad or the right reservation opportunity to the right user at just the right moment at a massive global scale.
As proud as we are in this growing influence, we believe that our revenue share represents only a small percentage of the transaction value we are driving for our partners. We are in year 1 of a multiyear voyage to plug this monetization leak, and we continue to make excellent progress. In hotels, the Wyndham Hotel Group and the Priceline Group are the latest of a growing list of more than 70 hotel chains, groups and OTA partners who wants to power bookings on our platform, including 7 of the top 10 brands -- top 10 hotel brands in the world.
In addition -- in particular, adding the Priceline Group to the platform is a huge win for our travelers as their high-quality room descriptions in many languages, multicurrency payment capabilities, great room pricing and stellar customer service enables us to accelerate our international rollout of Instant Booking over the coming year.
We expect to launch the Booking.com brand first, with the Priceline and Agoda brands to follow next year. Integration work has already begun, and I can tell you that I love what I'm seeing. And once we are fully alive, we expect users will be able to seamlessly book more than 400,000 properties on our platform in more than a dozen languages.
We're also helping independent hoteliers drive more bookings on our platform. We're working with more than 130 Internet booking engine partners, and we expect to connect many of their hotel clients over time. Regardless of a partner's size or global reach, Instant Bookings can drive reservations at a fair cost, solve the media attribution issues that have persisted within the Internet for years and enable our hotelier clients to develop more direct relationships with more travelers.
Our Marriott integration serves as a perfect example. After the signing contract in June, we completed the rollout in less than 2 months and we have seen great early results, including an improved conversion and more bookings for Marriott through our platform. As we add more globally recognized partners, we are further optimizing the booking experience on our site as well. This includes developing our own content management system for hotels and saving users' credit card information to make bookings faster and easier. I tip my hat to the entire Instant Booking team who has met this challenge head-on for a meaningful conversion improvements over the past year.
Based upon these improvements and given how important Instant Booking is to our long-term goals, we accelerated the rollout to our users in 2 of our largest markets in September. We believe that the accelerated rollouts scheduled contributed headwinds of approximately $10 million to revenue and $8 million to EBITDA during Q3. We expect to be live in more major markets in the next year, and we'll continue to carefully monitor the opportunity costs associated with this faster international rollout. We know the Instant Book experience is working for users and partners. 
The third piece of the puzzle is monetization for TripAdvisor. While not yet accretive, we believe that the faster we transition and teach travelers that they can book on TripAdvisor, the quicker we can plug the monetization link. Fortunately, we have extremely smart and motivated teams who are up to the challenge. We've successfully transitioned away from pop-up windows to successfully transitioning to metasearch, and I know that we will tackle this transition just as well.
On the marketing side, we're continuing to more deeply integrate the plan of comparing book message into our online and offline channels. A big channel for us this past year has been TV. While we've seen success in many countries and we're pleased with our TV efforts over the past couple of years, we've decided to put this marketing channel on pause for 2016 while we focus more on the global rollout of Instant Booking. Instead, we expect to increase our investment in some of our other global brand-building efforts where we also better leverage our community, both on the consumer and B2B side to fuel our Book on TripAdvisor initiatives.
In addition to our opportunity in hotels, we're matching more consumers and businesses in our fast-growing attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals categories. Our content and the community gives us the unique understanding of travelers, especially in attractions and restaurants, and we can relate [ph] more users at the exact moment if they're looking to find and book a great place to eat or a memorable thing to do.
These businesses constitute our other segment, which generated revenues of $75 million in the third quarter and $217 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over that time frame, we have been aggressively reinvesting profit to drive market share gains. We are just in the first year of what we have outlined as a 3- to 5-year growth initiative.
Shifting gears, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, the team and I are looking forward to welcoming Ernst Teunissen to TripAdvisor. Ernst brings significant financial and operational expertise as a global CFO and corporate strategist, and I look forward to collaborating with him as we pursue the significant growth opportunities ahead. He officially starts next week, and Julie will be with us through November 20 to ensure a smooth transition.
Before I close, 2015 is obviously a tremendous year for our Book on TripAdvisor initiatives. While still in the early days of this evolution, we continue to make tremendous strides towards our long-term growth objectives.
In closing, this is Julie's final earnings call with us, and I want to thank her again for all of her contributions over the past 4 years. I'd also like to thank all of our employees around the globe who build the products that users love and a more valuable platform for advertisers, positioning TripAdvisor for long-term success.
And now here's Julie."

This quarter, total revenue grew 17%. Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 9%. In constant currency, Q3 total revenue and EBITDA growth would have been 25% and 26%, respectively.
Our core hotel segment posted 8% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, and EBITDA margin held stable at 36%. Digging in, Q3 click-based revenue grew 6% or 14% in constant currency, driven by 16% hotel shopper growth and offset by continued pricing pressure, which includes impact from currency translation, lower CPC pricing and product changes we've made such as the decision to accelerate our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and U.K., our 2 largest markets. Revenue per hotel shopper growth reflects these headwinds as it decelerated to negative 10%. Normalizing for the significant year-over-year currency translation headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been better, though slight -- still slightly negative for the quarter due to a lower CPC pricing and the accelerated Instant Book rollout.
As a housekeeping item, note that during the third quarter, we improved our accounting methodology for unique users and hotel shoppers and have provided the recasted figures back through 2014 in the supplemental financial information tables, which are available on our IR site.
Our display-based business performed very well as revenue growth reaccelerated to 20%. These strong results were driven by 22% growth in ad impressions sold and we saw strength in the U.S. and EMEA markets with hotels, destination marketing organization and OTA customers in particular. Our display team continues to innovate this product offering, delivering great value to clients. As the currency environments stabilize, we expect that more clients will be in a position to leverage our scale and robust data management platform in their global ad campaigns.
Other segment revenue grew 92% in Q3, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins improved to positive 12% for the quarter, driven by high revenue seasonality in our attraction and vacation rental businesses.
We've operated this segment at EBITDA breakeven over the trailing 12 months and continue to reinvest aggressively in our products and sales efforts to drive long-term market share gains. We expect to see the typical seasonal step-down in Q4. And Q3 results, while strong, should not be taken as a new run rate in the near term. Over the long term, we believe margins will expand as we gain greater global scale.
As for expenses, selling and marketing delevered, primarily due to top line impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout and increased investment in our other segment businesses. We also had a full quarter of expenses related to our 2014 attraction acquisition last year, and we continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing resources to pursue our long-term growth objective in our newer categories.
I'll note that the quarter also contains approximately $20 million in television advertising spend, which was consistent with both our Q2 investment as well as the year ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, we've decided to put this investment on pause in 2016 and intend to expand our investment in other brand marketing channels as we roll out Instant Book more broadly. On the other expense line, general and administrative expenses levered slightly, and tech and content grew in line with revenue as we continue to actively seek talent to pursue our growth initiatives.
On the bottom line, GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.51, which included the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries, which contributed $0.12 to our GAAP diluted EPS this quarter. This gain on sale was not included in our non-GAAP net income result of $0.53 per diluted share as the gain is not considered indicative of our ongoing operational results.
Moving to headcount. We ended Q3 with approximately 3,000 employees, up 9%, driven primarily by the investments we're making to grow our attraction and restaurant businesses. As for taxes, our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate is 25%, decreased primarily due to the changes in full year forecasted geographical mix, including a nontaxable gain related to the sale of Kuxun, one of our Chinese subsidiaries. We continue to expect GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 27% to 28%.
We generated $8 million of cash from operations during the quarter or 2% of revenue. This line continues to highlight the growth and seasonality of our transaction businesses, where we collect cash at the time of booking and payout to suppliers at the time of stay or when the ticket is used. CapEx for the quarter was $39 million or 9% of revenue, driven primarily by leasehold improvements, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth.
CapEx should step down significantly as a percentage of revenue moving forward now that we have taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. We now expect 2015 capital expenditures to be 70% of revenue. We continue to run a very capital-efficient business.
Liquidity remains strong as well with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balance of $730 million. We also have an undrawn balance of $708 million from our $1 billion credit facility and just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan.
Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged as we look to be opportunistic when it comes to making organic and inorganic discretionary growth investments. Online travel remains competitive, and we tend to view investments through a long-term lens versus near-term payback.
Looking forward, Q4 will have a full quarter impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout, and we expect to begin onboarding Booking.com later this quarter. As such, we now expect 2015 revenue growth in the high teens and slightly negative EBITDA growth. This revised outlook attempts to be appropriately conservative to reflect these changes as well as foreign exchange rates as of today. This outlook does not assume future positive or negative FX movements, conversion or monetization improvements.
We expect to roll out Instant Booking faster over the coming periods, which is great for our travelers and our long-term business prospects as we begin to plug the monetization leak. Over the near term, it poses some forecasting challenges as we enable more properties roll out to many more users around the globe and continue to improve the monetization of the product.
As Ernst settles in over the coming months, the team will determine how to evolve communication on future expectations as well as the metrics by which progress will be measured. The business is heading in the right direction, and I've enjoyed being part of the journey. I want to personally thank Steve and the entire TripAdvisor team for a great 4 years.
We will now open the call up to your questions."

So the arc of conversion improvement, I would say, has been fairly steady since we launched over a year ago. Month in, month out, sometimes week in, week out, we're just making a constant improvement. I note, heads up, coming up is kind of step change because we're adding Priceline. Super excited about this deal with the Priceline Group because they offer a great brand, global inventory, tremendous content, kind of rich. And I've talked about this several times in the past, very rich written descriptions. And a lot of the information that our travelers are telling us, they want to see on our site before they hit the book button. And at times, they have to leave our site, even when they've gone into the Instant Booking flow, because we haven't been able to provide everything that the customer is looking for. Booking.com or Expedia, for that matter, have tremendous content. They've been able to provide that information. That's why the conversion rates on their sites are as good as they are. This deal allows us to bring in that rich information into our Instant Booking flow. And so we don't know the impact on the conversion rate and we'll know shortly as we roll it out, but that's really going to be a big difference maker in terms of -- if the slow and steady improvement that we've made have come potential step change when we launch with Priceline Group. Having said that, we faced the choice last year in looking -- for the past year, in looking at the international rollout because it's been a challenge for us to figure out how to get the content that we need in all the languages and support all the currency types. All of a sudden, that challenge is addressed for us in this Priceline deal, and so it makes it just technically or practically feasible to roll it out. It adds additional uncertainty in our forecasting because while we have a decent amount of experience now in U.S. and U.K., we don't quite know how Instant Book is going to be flowing in, in France, in Japan, all throughout Asia, all throughout all the other markets that we look to roll it out in. Priceline has great content. We -- the partnership will work in all the countries, but we don't know the conversion impact relative to the meta [ph] prices that we have. Coming back up another level, we're really excited about what this does for the business. We've always said that we're ready to go it [ph] alone without an OTA partner because it was the right thing for the business. That was true. Having Priceline in the fold now just allows us to be able to go faster on the path that we were headed down anyways, and that path [ph] has always been pretty important to for us. It is a big transition as we've gone through several in the past, and we're looking forward to not only the week-by-week improvement, but the step change function that we hope this Priceline deal will deliver. To the second part of your question, television, one of the reasons that we wanted to talk about television on this call is that TV is often a long term -- it's an advanced buy. It's something that you need to plan in advance. And so while we're telling folks that we've decided to pull back, for 2016 at least, we don't want anyone to think that, ""Hey, we're just taking all that money and hanging on to it."" We will be attempting -- we will be spending some of the money in other channels, and so we don't want anyone's model to just drop it to the bottom line. We haven't decided how much and of course, all throughout the year, we will be evaluating opportunities as they come up, put this [ph] TV with such long-term commitment, we have enough visibility into that specific decision."

And if we can do that and if we can monetize those hotel shoppers to the degree that any other OTA monetizes the hotel shoppers, that's a really big win for us. And while TV was meant to help that, we feel we actually already have the traveler on our site. And by doing other things on our site, we can also affect that plug the leak. We also have the entire global world to look at. And so an extremely global TV educational campaign is hundreds of millions of dollars, but we already have the traffic that's live.

We do think about those questions ourselves quite a bit, of course. The reason Priceline enables us to accelerate our Instant Book rollout globally is because of the rich content that they have on 400,000-plus properties all around the globe. And by that, I mean, if they are able to successfully take bookings on the 400,000-plus properties in multiple different languages, processing payments for multiple different credit cards issued by multiple different banks, all sorts of things because they're such a strong sort of global hotel reservation player like Expedia. So I'm not saying that they're different there and simply saying, they already have the ability for someone that lives in France or in Japan. They come to their site to see the inventory that a traveler wants to stay in -- see all the room descriptions in the local language, make the bookings using the local credit cards. And we didn't have any of that for that customer in Japan, for instance, on TripAdvisor today. So if I were to roll out TripAdvisor today, I would be showing an Instant Book experience in English to that Japanese traveler. I would be showing a room description for a Marriott property in English for that -- Marriott might be a bad example because we might have Japanese content -- but an independent hotel or a independent brand, we would be showing content in the wrong language to make it a highly converting experience. Priceline gives us all of that, one fell swoop in its highly strong curated content, payments and breadth of inventory. That allows us to push faster in IB. We hope for an improved conversion rate, travelers on our site going through that funnel because the experience is better. And so when we look -- we will know shortly enough whether or not that yields or higher net revenue all the way to being accretive for us as we roll out Instant Book. I'm not sure being plus or minus, slightly accretive or slightly negative is going to influence the timing of the rollout. Per my earlier comments of -- we know this is the right thing to do for the traveler. We know this is the right thing to do for long-term direction of TripAdvisor. We always stated we're willing to take some short-term hits along the way if it gets us to where we want to be, and we have 18 months of history where we have improved our conversion quarter after quarter after quarter so that we're confident. ""Hey, we're always going to be making progress. We may not always be as fast as or -- may not always be instantly, but we'll get there.""

So the counting on the hotel shoppers, boy, if you can understand the challenge that us and every other web company goes through to figure out who, when visiting the site, is the real user versus a robot type. And we do kind of our best job and we're always looking at the algorithms. And from time to time, we find that there's something that we missed. And in this particular case, we revamped the algorithm to cut out some of the traffic that we didn't think at the end of the day was real. So we're always trying to present you the most accurate metrics that we have. We recast them to see the year on-year -- over the past period. It obviously has no impact on revenue. We're scraping out -- we're filtering out traffic that wasn't real. So it's a housekeeping footnote. You'll see the stuff has changed. I personally didn't pay any attention to it when I learned about it. In terms of last quarter, citing some weakness in Europe, I think we had a thesis at the time, based upon some of the evidence in front of us on sort of cross-border traffic and weakness of the dollar. When we look at the macro issues in our past Q3, we're really pointing at Instant Book, the accelerated rollout, right, long-term decisions, short term, a small amount of pain that we're certainly willing to take. And then we're looking at -- as we go forward, I mean, there is some pricing headwind that we see in our standard meta business. And it's a meta business, it's an auction. We don't set the price. Our clients bid up, bid down. There's more consolidation on the global space. There's a ton of different trends, not to mention currency, going on. At the end of the day, we believe our leads are just disqualified. [ph] So even if there's a bit of a pricing hit, it's not something that we can influence. But we can influence and really, what we're focused on is making IB as successful as it can be going forward. And that's why to double down, we're even more excited about the Priceline deal and its -- our ability to roll it out even quicker."

Q4, we're also seeing the full year of the Instant Booking headwind, which, as a team, is working actively to optimize and make that accretive with every expectation that, that would continue into 2016. And in addition to the monetization headwinds, there is a slight shift in the way revenue is recognized. So with the majority of our click-based revenue today, we recognize revenue on click immediately. As Instant Book becomes a more meaningful amount of revenue, we'll be -- experience the shift because with Instant Book, the majority of our large partners, including the Priceline Group, we will be recognizing revenue on stay. So there'll be some seasonality and a shift in revenue as that becomes a more meaningful number. So that's something else to take into consideration in evaluating 2016. We're in a process of doing that ourselves, looking at booking windows and consumer behavior, and we'll make an estimate into our 2016 plan."

So I will know whether there are any changes in the display or the participation in meta by Priceline Group. Once they -- once everything's actually rolled out, I'm not under any impression that being in Instant Book would change anyone's participation in meta, let alone the Priceline Group. They've always expressed to us, as every client has, that they like as many transactions through our platform as possible. So I certainly would encourage you to ask the Priceline Group themselves, but my interpretation would be they are eager for all the traffic that they can get in meta just like they have in all the years past. They've been a phenomenal partner for us over many years and they're excited about the new transactions we'll be delivering to the Instant Book path. So it's kind of additive, and I think that's how the discussions have always been based, that it's additive to their thinking of how to maximize their participation in the TripAdvisor channel. To the second part of the question, which marketing channels are most efficient, we tend to look for as many marketing channels as we can find that deliver sort of quality traffic. And for the most part, we operate them on a breakeven basis. We view it as acquiring trial, and I'm talking about some sort of ROI-generating online channels, be it the search or retargeting or CPM or any of the other methods of acquiring -- methods of acquiring the traffic. Other marketing channels that we'll be working on offline, so many of them, it's nearly impossible to measure. We do quite a bit amount of ER. We do a fair amount of content licensing. We do a fair amount of other -- of engaging in various markets in -- by leveraging our B2B or B2C community. None of those have a direct ROI, but we spend serious dollars in them. And I think that's one of the reasons why, if you're ever traveling, you're likely to see something branded TripAdvisor along the way and a TripAdvisor rating, and we love all that. We don't even try to measure the marketing efficiency of those campaigns."

I know you can't about talk about the length of any deals or the terms, but how long might that take to -- for an auction to -- there [ph] should become a reality? And then just secondly, I think maybe one of the reasons why your partners get comfortable with Instant Book, and correct me if I'm wrong, is because they get to feature your brand in the actual booking process, I assume, because it can lend itself to repeat customer economics over time. Obviously, that booking is still being made through trips. So what can you tell us so far about which product you might be occurring the [ph] benefit of these repeat economics over time?"

So as part of the sign-up process for an independent hotel on the website, there's 2 commission rates, the 12% and 15%. Then we offer the hotel sort of a guaranteed share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, what we call, eligible impression, so -- of the folks visiting their page basically. It's part of our sort of sales pitch that if you sign up, this is what we promise you. It can well be a lot more than that depending on a lot of different factors. And so going forward, that independent who has signed up, even at a 15% commission, TripAdvisor has -- once the Booking.com deal is live as of -- or even today with our current OTA partners, we make a choice at run time that as -- beyond the share guarantee, do I wish to show -- get a room as an OTA for that hotel or if the hotel itself or tango [ph] as an OTA for the hotel. So for any particular property, I might already have 3 or more auction -- 3 or more participants in Instant Book. We make the decision based on who to show. Once the share guarantee has been met, we make the decision based upon what we think is going to be the best answer for the consumer because that's usually going to be the best answer for TripAdvisor. What I mean is we have to evaluate how good the content is, the quality of the room descriptions because the consumer wants to see that in order to hit the book button. We also care a lot about the price. And so whoever has the cheaper price is also going to have a higher conversion rate on our site. And then finally, if the commission does come into play, you can imagine an extreme of somebody offering to pay a ridiculous 20% commission for a property while somebody else is offering to pay a 12%. If all other things are equal, then TripAdvisor is going to pick the 20% commission. That kind of maximizes us and there's no harm to the consumer because, as I said, all the other aspects of the flow were equivalent. With the current OTAs, with Priceline, with the brands that we have with the Priceline Group, with eventually multiple brands from the Priceline Group, I think we'll have quite a choice as to who could fulfill the offer. And we'll look at it from mostly what's the best experience for the consumer and secondarily, who has a good commission to us. You should interpret that as at the end of the day, that combination is probably going to maximize TripAdvisor's revenue because I care the most about how many people are booking. And if I make a little bit less commission per booking but more people convert, we're going to make more money. Consumers are going to be happier and that's the way [ph] that we're looking for. So the second part of the question, the -- sort of who -- if I understand correctly, who gets the benefit of the brand placement in the booking flow, it's a bit -- from our perspective, it's too early to tell. We just haven't been in the marketplace long enough on the -- on enough of our platforms in order to see who might get. And I'm not even sure how carefully I can measure, but I'm not sure who's going to get that second booking, the second trip, which tends not to happen the next day or even the next week. So we want to be very clear with all of our partners and certainly, our travelers, that it's -- get a room, whether it's Booking.com that is powering for Marriott, that is powering this transaction. They are the folks that you're going to go to when you want to make a change. There'll be -- Marriott is the owner of the property. They can answer the question faster than we can if the traveler has one. And if it's a second time booking for a similar property, we're certainly okay if that ends up being supplier direct. Our biggest opportunity is the traveler who comes to our site enjoys the reviews, sees the room tips, looks at a dozen different candid photos and says, ""Yes, this is the property I'm looking for. I like the price. Maybe I go down the Instant Book flow. I'd select the type of room, but I'm not ready to book right now."" And the next day or later in the week, when they're sure they want to take that trip, sure they want to stay in that property, they come back to TripAdvisor to finish the booking. And if we can close that leak, just that one piece of the -- plug the leak, phenomenal huge win on TripAdvisor even if the partner that powers the transaction, the Marriott or the Priceline, wins the second booking because they have a great remarketing or retargeting campaign. Getting that first booking for us is -- obviously, I want both, but getting that first booking for us, by changing the mindset of the traveler, that's the biggest win that we see over the next couple of years."

So I don't -- I wouldn't claim yet that I have an answer as to how we can quickly change consumers' mindsets. I look back and say, ""TripAdvisor hasn't really had an awareness issue in most of our markets."" TV does a great job growing awareness, so we see how it's worked for so many other companies. But the other companies have tended to be at a different awareness stage or different growth stage, and so we went forward with TV knowing that it wasn't to move our awareness numbers but to educate folks on that one click now book on TripAdvisor. And it's been -- we did surveys on the TV and certainly, the book message stood out. But it was harder to see the behavior change on TripAdvisor. We saw more traffic. We made more money, but it was softer to draw the conclusion that it got people to actually complete a transaction to book on TripAdvisor. So there would be, in my mind, no harm whatsoever in taking away TV campaign that has the same message or -- I like the creative, but the same or different creative, nothing wrong with that. It couldn't possibly hurt. But in the judgment call of is that where we want to push on our branding and marketing for next year, we made the judgment call because they asked to make this one in advance that -- so we're going to pause. I use the word was carefully because I'm not saying we wouldn't change our mind. We wouldn't do something else in 2017 or maybe in the late 2016, but the notion is that's not -- it's a big dollar bet, and that's not what we're going to spend those dollars on in '16. When we look at it from -- ""Wow, you have 100-plus million travelers on the site in a month,"" 150 million or 175 million, surely, that's a big enough sample size to work on the educational message. And recently, we've been doing quite a bit on that. So if you go to the site, many of our devices, not all, you'll see a much stronger -- you can book on TripAdvisor, combined with the appearance of a book on TripAdvisor button on hundreds of thousands of [ph] properties, plus the global rollout plus being [indiscernible] from other brand communication, better, different/cheaper than TV, we think that there's, well, as I started with -- a judgment call, there was something kind of wrong with the TV, but we think we can achieve our goals better in terms of trading book by spending our time and some of our dollars elsewhere."

You've heard me talk about it over and over, but I don't want anyone to think that meta is going away. Our messaging of plan, compare and book -- plan, that's the reviews, the content that's a great decision, support the information that we have in order to help the consumer find exactly where they want to go, where they want to stay, what they want to do to have the great trip, that's the plan message. The compare is everyone's looking for the best price. Showing a price on TripAdvisor and Instant Booking is one of the options. And showing the price that is available elsewhere on the web from all the other players that the travelers are aware of is part of that core compare message. And we expect to have that compare message for the forever future. It's just part of our core positioning. And plan, compare and book. And we want TripAdvisor Instant Booking to offer a great price, terrific content, the trusted brand of TripAdvisor as to why you should click in, seeing the content and the brand provided by [indiscernible] actually doing, powering the booking for us, the hotel itself or the high-quality travel agent like Priceline or any of the other OTAs that are in store, and they kind of complete that part of the purchase. And then the rest of the TripAdvisor value proposition, we're still very excited about -- we classify into our other businesses, the attractions and the restaurants and the other ways that are going to make a trip incredibly powerful. But it's Instant Booking and meta as that core monetization vehicle for hotels. It's restaurants and attractions and other services in the -- on the trip piece, vacation rentals and alternative lodging in general that helps people -- well, if a hotel isn't quite what you're looking for, we have these other options, whether it be urban inventory that we're sourcing through our vacation rentals, standard alternative lodging like the traditional vacation rentals, those are all part of our store, and it's our job to -- our challenge or opportunity to present them at the right time to the travelers that are on our site. All in all, it's a pretty complete picture. It doesn't have everything, but when we look at the things that travelers are most interested, we have -- we would like to think the best offering in the plan space. We have a great offering in the compare space. We're learning how to have the best offering in the book space. We don't have it yet, but we're getting there. And we have the best offering in the in-destination market or attractions and restaurants globally. So that's a pretty good coverage of that life cycle. And I guess, the question started with Priceline, and so Priceline really helped us deliver on that book component. Thanks for the question.
All right. With that, I think we're a bit out of time. So let me say thank you very much. We're moving fast. We're making great progress on these long-term goals. And I have to say, I'm really fortunate to have a great team on the job. So to all of our employees throughout the entire TripAdvisor family, thank you again and again for your terrific work, for your hard work. It's showing results. I'm really proud. And I look forward to updating everyone again on the next quarter. Thank you."

I'm going to update you on our progress on how we're developing the best products for users, expanding our strong global platform to more partners and building a bigger and better business over the long term.
Our Q3 results clearly show the major impact currency headwinds are having on the business. Total revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% or 25% and 26% growth, respectively, in constant currency. As I'll describe in more detail later in my remarks, our results and business outlook also highlight that we were moving quickly in pursuit of our long-term goals to make TripAdvisor a great place to discover and book the things that make a trip memorable.
First, we'll talk about how TripAdvisor's consumer value proposition continues to strengthen in content, community and mobile. In content, with 290 million reviews and opinions on 5.3 million businesses around the world, TripAdvisor products are indispensable travel planning tools. Member growth has accelerated this year and those members are contributing content at a record pace of 190 per minute, the fastest growth in our history. This puts us on track to add another 100 million reviews and opinions over the next 12 months, making our travel planning products and tools fresher, richer and better for every user on every device in every geography.
Our global travel community also continues to grow as evidenced by unique monthly visitor growth of 23% and hotel shopper growth of 16%. Travelers can find information on more than 3.6 million restaurants and attractions, so it's no surprise that unique visitors to these pages continues to grow quickly. We attribute much of this growth in engagement to mobile, where TripAdvisor's helpful reviews, tips, photos and guides are the perfect travel companion.
Mobile usage makes up more than half of our traffic. In this quarter, we reached more than 230 million app downloads across our brands, including 215 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We're monetizing better on that platform as well as this quarter's hotel shoppers on phone monetized a 25% the rate of those on desktop, which is up nearly 40% since 2 years ago.
Perhaps more importantly, this speaks to the large mobile monetization opportunity in front of us. Mobile give us yet another powerful way to connect directly with consumers. Continuous iteration and innovation here is key and every TripAdvisor team is actively engaged in delivering more value to users and partners on these devices.
On any device, TripAdvisor users are close to making a purchase. In fact, a recent Oxford economic study estimates that TripAdvisor influenced more than 10% of global travel transactions in 2014, whether it's a hotel stay for a long weekend, a reservation for 2 at a hot new restaurant or tickets for a hop-on hop-off city tour, these are extremely powerful moments for advertisers as travel purchases tend to be extremely nuanced, contextual and episodic. TripAdvisor delivers the right ad or the right reservation opportunity to the right user at just the right moment at massive global scale.
As proud as we are in this growing influence, we believe that our revenue share represents only a small percentage of the transaction value we are driving for our partners. We are in year 1 of a multiyear voyage to plug this monetization leak, and we continue to make excellent progress. In hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group and the Priceline Group are the latest of a growing list of more than 70 hotel chains, groups and OTA partners who want to power bookings on our platform, including 7 of the top 10 brands -- top 10 hotel brands in the world.
In addition -- in particular, adding the Priceline Group to the platform is a huge win for our travelers as their high-quality room descriptions in many languages, multicurrency payment capabilities, great room pricing and stellar customer service enables us to accelerate our international rollout of Instant Booking over the coming year.
We expect to launch the Booking.com brand first, with the Priceline and Agoda brands to follow next year. Integration work has already begun, and I can tell you that I love what I'm seeing. And once we are fully live, we expect users will be able to seamlessly book more than 400,000 properties on our platform in more than a dozen languages.
We're also helping independent hoteliers drive more bookings on our platform. We're working with more than 130 Internet booking engine partners, and we expect to connect many of their hotel clients over time. Regardless of a partner's size or global reach, Instant Bookings can drive reservations at a fair cost, solve the media attribution issues that have persisted in the Internet for years and enable our hotelier clients to develop more direct relationships with more travelers.
Our Marriott integration serves as a perfect example. After signing the contract in June, we completed the rollout in less than 2 months and we have seen great early results, including improved conversion and more bookings for Marriott through our platform. As we add more globally recognized partners, we are further optimizing the booking experience on our site as well. This includes developing our own content management system for hotels and saving users' credit card information to make bookings faster and easier. I tip my hat to the entire Instant Booking team who has met this challenge head-on for meaningful conversion improvements over the past year.
Based upon these improvements and given how important Instant Booking is to our long-term goals, we accelerated the rollout to our users in 2 of our largest markets in September. We believe that this accelerated rollout schedule contributed headwinds of approximately $10 million to revenue and $8 million to EBITDA during Q3. We expect to be live in more major markets in the next year, and we'll continue to carefully monitor the opportunity costs associated with this faster international rollout. We know the Instant Book experience is working for users and partners. 
The third piece of the puzzle is monetization for TripAdvisor. While not yet accretive, we believe that the faster we transition and teach travelers that they can book on TripAdvisor, the quicker we can plug the monetization leak. Fortunately, we have extremely smart and motivated teams who are up to the challenge. We've successfully transitioned away from pop-up windows, to successfully transitioning to metasearch, and I know that we will tackle this transition just as well.
On the marketing side, we're continuing to more deeply integrate the plan comparing book message into our online and offline channels. A big channel for us this past year has been TV. While we've seen success in many countries and we're pleased with our TV efforts over the past couple of years, we've decided to put this marketing channel on pause [ph] for 2016 while we focus more on the global rollout of Instant Booking. Instead, we expect to increase our investment in some of our other global brand-building efforts where we also better leverage our community, both on the consumer and B2B side to fuel our Book on TripAdvisor initiatives.
In addition to our opportunity in hotels, we're matching more consumers and businesses in our fast-growing attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals categories. Our content and community gives us the unique understanding of travelers, especially in attractions and restaurants, and we can delight more users at the exact moment that they're looking to find and book a great place to eat or a memorable thing to do.
These businesses constitute our other segment, which generated revenues of $75 million in the third quarter and $217 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over that time frame, we have been aggressively reinvesting profit to drive market share gains. We are just in the first year of what we have outlined as a 3- to 5-year growth initiative.
Shifting gears, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, the team and I are looking forward to welcoming Ernst Teunissen to TripAdvisor. Ernst brings significant financial and operational expertise as a global CFO and corporate strategist, and I look forward to collaborating with him as we pursue the significant growth opportunities ahead. He officially starts next week, and Julie will be with us through November 20 to ensure a smooth transition.
Before I close, 2015 has obviously been a tremendous year for our Book on TripAdvisor initiative. While still in the early days of this evolution, we continue to make tremendous strides towards our long-term growth objectives.
In closing, this is Julie's final earnings call with us, and I want to thank her again for all of her contributions over the past 4 years. I'd also like to thank all of our employees around the globe who build the products that users love and a more valuable platform for advertisers, positioning TripAdvisor for long-term success.
And now here's Julie."

This quarter, total revenue grew 17%. Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 9%. In constant currency, Q3 total revenue and EBITDA growth would have been 25% and 26%, respectively.
Our core hotel segment posted 8% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, and EBITDA margins held stable at 36%. Digging in, Q3 click-based revenue grew 6% or 14% in constant currency, driven by 16% hotel shopper growth and offset by continued pricing pressure, which includes impact from currency translation, lower CPC pricing and product changes we've made such as the decision to accelerate our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and U.K., our 2 largest markets. Revenue per hotel shopper growth reflects these headwinds as it decelerated to negative 10%. Normalizing for the significant year-over-year currency translation headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been better, though slight -- still slightly negative for the quarter due to a lower CPC pricing and the accelerated Instant Book rollout.
As a housekeeping item, note that during the third quarter, we improved our accounting methodology for unique users and hotel shoppers and have provided the recasted figures back through 2014 in the supplemental financial information tables, which are available on our IR site.
Our display-based business performed very well as revenue growth reaccelerated to 20%. These strong results were driven by 22% growth in ad impressions sold and we saw strength in the U.S. and EMEA markets with hotels, destination marketing organization and OTA customers in particular. Our display team continues to innovate this product offering, delivering great value to clients. As the currency environments stabilize, we expect that more clients will be in a position to leverage our scale in robust data management platform in their global ad campaigns.
Other segment revenue grew 92% in Q3, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins improved to positive 12% for the quarter, driven by high revenue seasonality in our attraction and vacation rental businesses.
We've operated this segment at EBITDA breakeven over the trailing 12 months and continue to reinvest aggressively in our products and sales efforts to drive long-term market share gains. We expect to see the typical seasonal step-down in Q4. And Q3 results, while strong, should not be taken as a new run rate in the near term. Over the long term, we believe margins will expand as we gain greater global scale.
As for expenses, selling and marketing delevered, primarily due to top line impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout and increased investment in our other segment businesses. We also had a full quarter of expenses related to our 2014 attraction acquisition last year, and we continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing resources to pursue our long-term growth objectives in our newer categories.
I'll note that the quarter also contained approximately $20 million in television advertising spend, which was consistent with both our Q2 investment as well as the year ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, we've decided to put this investment on pause in 2016 and intend to expand our investment in other brand marketing channels as we roll out Instant Book more broadly. On the other expense line, general and administrative expenses levered slightly, and tech and content grew in line with revenue as we continue to actively seek talent to pursue our growth initiatives.
On the bottom line, GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.51, which included the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries, which contributed $0.12 to our GAAP diluted EPS this quarter. This gain on sale was not included in our non-GAAP net income results of $0.53 per diluted share as the gain is not considered indicative of our ongoing operational results.
Moving to headcount. We ended Q3 with approximately 3,000 employees, up 9%, driven primarily by the investments we're making to grow our attraction and restaurant businesses. As for taxes, our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate of 25%, decreased primarily due to the changes in full year forecasted geographical mix, including a nontaxable gain related to the sale of Kuxun, one of our Chinese subsidiaries. We continue to expect GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 27% to 28%.
We generated $8 million of cash from operations during the quarter or 2% of revenue. This line continues to highlight the growth and seasonality of our transaction businesses, where we collect cash at the time of booking and payout to suppliers at the time of stay or when the ticket is used. CapEx for the quarter was $39 million or 9% of revenue, driven primarily by leasehold improvements, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth.
CapEx should step down significantly as a percentage of revenue moving forward now that we have taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. We now expect 2015 capital expenditures to be 7% of revenue. We continue to run a very capital-efficient business.
Liquidity remains strong as well with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balance of $730 million. We also have an undrawn balance of $708 million from our $1 billion credit facility and just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan.
Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged as we look to be opportunistic when it comes to making organic and inorganic discretionary growth investments. Online travel remains competitive, and we tend to view investments through a long-term lens versus near-term payback.
Looking forward, Q4 will have a full quarter impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout, and we expect to begin onboarding Booking.com later this quarter. As such, we now expect 2015 revenue growth in the high teens and slightly negative EBITDA growth. This revised outlook attempts to be appropriately conservative to reflect these changes as well as foreign exchange rates as of today. This outlook does not assume future positive or negative FX movements, conversion or monetization improvements.
We expect to roll out Instant Booking faster over the coming periods, which is great for our travelers and our long-term business prospects as we begin to plug the monetization leaks. Over the near term, it poses some forecasting challenges as we enable more properties, roll out to many more users around the globe and continue to improve the monetization of the product.
As Ernst settles in over the coming months, the team will determine how to evolve communication on future expectations as well as the metrics by which progress will be measured. The business is heading in the right direction, and I've enjoyed being part of the journey. I want to personally thank Steve and the entire TripAdvisor team for a great 4 years.
We will now open the call up to your questions."

So the arc of conversion improvement, I would say, has been fairly steady since we launched over a year ago. Month in, month out, sometimes week in, week out, we're just making a constant improvement. I note, heads up, coming up is kind of step change because we're adding Priceline. Super excited about this deal with the Priceline Group because they offer a great brand, global inventory, tremendous content, kind of rich. And I've talked about this several times in the past, very rich written [ph] descriptions. And a lot of the information that our travelers are telling us they want to see on our site before they hit the book button. And at times, they have to leave our site, even when they've gone into the Instant Booking flow, because we haven't been able to provide everything that the customer is looking for. Booking.com or Expedia, for that matter, have tremendous content, have been able to provide that information. That's why the conversion rates on their sites are as good as they are. This deal allows us to bring in that rich information into our Instant Booking flow. And so we don't know the impact on the conversion rate and we'll know shortly as we roll it out, but that's really going to be a big difference maker in terms of if the slow and steady improvement that we've made upcome potential step change when we launch with Priceline Group. Having said that, we faced a choice last year in looking -- or this past year, in looking at the international rollout because it's been a challenge for us to figure out how to get the content that we need in all the languages and support all the currency types. All of a sudden, that challenge is addressed for us in this Priceline deal, and so it makes it just technically or practically feasible to roll it out. It adds additional uncertainty in our forecasting because while we have a decent amount of experience now in U.S. and U.K., we don't quite know how Instant Book is going to be flowing in France, in Japan, all throughout Asia, all throughout all the other markets that we look to roll it out in. Priceline has great content. We -- the partnership will work in all the countries, but we don't know the conversion impact relative to the meta [ph] prices that we have. Coming back up another level, we're really excited about what this does for the business. We've always said that we're ready to go it alone without an OTA partner because it was the right thing for the business. That was true. Having Priceline in the fold now just allows us to be able to go faster on the path that we were headed down anyways, and that faster has always been pretty important to for us. It is a big transition as we've gone through several in the past, and we're looking forward to not only the week-by-week improvement, but the step change function that we hope this Priceline deal will deliver. To the second part of your question, television, one of the reasons that we wanted to talk about television in this call is that TV is often a long term -- it's an advance buy. It's something that you need to plan in advance. And so while we're telling folks that we've decided to pull back for 2016 at least, we don't want anyone to think that, ""Hey, we're just taking all that money and hanging on to it."" We will be attempting -- we will be spending some of the money in other channels, and so we don't want anyone's model to just drop it to the bottom line. We haven't decided how much and of course, all throughout the year, we will be evaluating opportunities as they come up, but since TV was such long-term commitment, we had enough visibility into that specific decision."

And if we can do that and if we can monetize those hotel shoppers to the degree that any other OTA monetizes the hotel shoppers, that's a really big win for us. And while TV was meant to help that, we feel we actually already have the traveler on our site. And by doing other things on our site, we can also affect that, plug the leak. We also have an entire global world to look at. And so an extremely global TV educational campaign is hundreds of millions of dollars, but we already have the traffic that's live.

We do think about those questions ourselves quite a bit, of course. The reason Priceline enables us to accelerate our Instant Book rollout globally is because of the rich content that they have on 400,000-plus properties all around the globe. And by that, I mean, if they are able to successfully take bookings on 400,000-plus properties in multiple, multiple different languages, processing payments for multiple different credit cards issued by multiple different banks, all sorts of things because they're such a strong sort of global hotel reservation player like Expedia. So I'm not saying that they're different there, I'm simply saying, they already have the ability for someone that lives in France or in Japan to come to their site to see the inventory that a traveler wants to stay in -- see all the room descriptions in the local language, make the bookings using the local credit cards. And we didn't have any of that for that customer in Japan, for instance, on TripAdvisor today. So if I were to roll out TripAdvisor today, I would be showing an Instant Book experience in English to that Japanese traveler. I would be showing a room description for a Marriott property in English for that -- Marriott might be a bad example because we might have Japanese content -- but an independent hotel or a different brand, we would be showing content in the wrong language to make it a highly converting experience. Priceline gives us all of that, one fell swoop in its highly strong curated content, payments and breadth of inventory. That allows us to push faster in IB. We hope for an improved conversion rate, travelers on our site going through that funnel because the experience is better. And so when we look, we will know shortly enough whether or not that yields a higher net revenue all the way to being accretive for us as we roll out Instant Book. I'm not sure being plus or minus, slightly accretive or slightly negative is going to influence the timing of the rollout. Per my earlier comments of -- we know this is the right thing to do for the traveler. We know this is the right thing to do for the long-term direction of TripAdvisor. We always stated we're willing to take some short-term hits along the way if it gets us to where we want to be, and we have 18 months of history where we have improved our conversion quarter after quarter after quarter so that we're confident. ""Hey, we're always going to be making progress. We may not always be as fast as or -- it may not always be instantly, but we'll get there."" And that's what gives us confidence to do a quick rollout even if it's not sort of instantly accretive. Hope that helped."

So the counting on the hotel shoppers, boy, if you can understand the challenge that us and every other web company goes through to figure out who, when visiting the site, is a real user versus a robot of type. And we do kind of our best job and we're always looking at the algorithms. And from time to time, we find that there's something that we missed. And in this particular case, we revamped the algorithm to cut out some of the traffic that we didn't think at the end of the day was real. So we're always trying to present you the most accurate metrics that we have. We recast them to see the year on-year over the past period. It obviously has no impact on revenue if we're scraping out -- we're filtering out traffic that wasn't real. So as a housekeeping footnote, you'll see the stuff has changed. I personally didn't pay any attention to it when I learned about it. In terms of last quarter, citing some weakness in Europe, I think we had a thesis at the time, based upon some of the evidence in front of us on sort of cross-border traffic and the weakness in the dollar. When we look at the macro issues in our past Q3, we're really pointing at Instant Book, the accelerated rollout, right, long-term decision, short term, a small amount of pain that we're certainly willing to take. And then we're looking at -- as we go forward, I mean, there is some pricing headwind that we see in our standard meta business. And it's a meta business, it's an auction. We don't set the price. Our clients bid up, bid down. There's more consolidation in the global space. There's a ton of different trends, not to mention currency, going on. At the end of the day, we believe our leads are just as qualified. So even if there's a bit of a pricing hit, it's not something that we can influence. But we can influence and really, what we're focused on is making IB as successful as it can be going forward. And that's why to double down, we're even more excited about the Priceline deal and its -- our ability to roll it out even quicker."

Q4, we're also seeing the full year of Instant Booking headwinds, which, as the team is working actively to optimize and make that accretive would there be expectation that, that would continue into 2016? And in addition to the monetization headwinds, there is a slight shift in the way revenue is recognized. So with the majority of our click-based revenue today, we recognize revenue on click immediately. As Instant Book becomes a more meaningful amount of revenue, we'll be -- experience a shift because with Instant Book, for the majority of our large partners, including the Priceline Group, we will be recognizing revenue on stay. So there'll be some seasonality and a shift in revenue as that becomes a more meaningful number. So that's something else to take into consideration in evaluating 2016. We're in the process of doing that ourselves, looking at booking windows and consumer behavior, and we'll make an estimate into our 2016 plan."

So I will know whether there are any changes in the display or the participation in meta by Priceline Group. Once they -- once everything's actually rolled out, I'm not under any impression that being in Instant Book would change anyone's participation in meta, let alone the Priceline Group. They've always expressed to us, as every client has, that they'd like as many transactions through our platform as possible. So I certainly would encourage you to ask the Priceline Group themselves, but my interpretation would be they are eager for all the traffic that they can get in meta just like they have in all the years past. They've been a phenomenal partner for us over many years and they're excited about the new transactions we'll be delivering through the Instant Book path. So it's kind of additive, and I think that's how the discussions have always been based, that it's additive to their thinking of how to maximize their participation in the TripAdvisor channel. To the second part of the question, which marketing channels are most efficient, we tend to look for as many marketing channels as we can find that deliver sort of quality traffic. And for the most part, we operate them on a breakeven basis. We view it as acquiring trial, and I'm talking about sort of ROI-generating online channels, be it search or retargeting or CPM or any of the other methods of acquiring -- methods of acquiring the traffic. Other marketing channels that we'll be working on offline, so many of them, it's nearly impossible to measure. We do quite a bit amount of ER. We do a fair amount of content licensing. We do a fair amount of other -- of engaging in various markets in -- by leveraging our B2B or B2C community. None of those have a direct ROI, but we spend serious dollars in them. And I think that's one of the reasons why, if you're ever traveling, you're likely to see something branded TripAdvisor along the way and a TripAdvisor rating, and we love all that. We don't even try to measure the marketing efficiency of those campaigns."

I know you can't about talk about the length of any deals or the terms, but how long might that take to -- for an auction to eventually become a reality? And then just secondly, I think maybe one of the reasons why your partners got comfortable with Instant Book, and correct me if I'm wrong, is because they get to feature their brand in the actual booking process, I assume, because it can lend itself to repeat customer economics over time. Obviously, that booking is still being made through Trip. So what can you tell us so far about which party might be accruing the benefit of those repeat economics over time?"

So as part of the sign-up process for an independent hotel on the website, there's 2 commission rates, a 12% and 15%. Then we offer the hotel sort of a guaranteed share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, what we call, eligible impress",880,"Certainly. So as part of the sign-up process for an independent hotel on the website, there's 2 commission rates, a 12% and 15%. Then we offer the hotel sort of a guaranteed share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, what we call, eligible impressions, so -- of the folks visiting their page basically. It's part of our sort of sales pitch that if you sign up, this is what we promise you. It can well be a lot more than that depending on a lot of different factors. And so going forward, that independent who has signed up, even at a 15% commission, TripAdvisor has -- once the Booking.com deal is live as of -- or even today with our current OTA partners, we make a choice at run time that as -- beyond the share guarantee, do I wish to show -- get a room as an OTA for that hotel or the hotel itself or Tingo has an OTA for the hotel. So for any particular property, I might already have 3 or more auction -- 3 or more participants in Instant Book. We make the decision based on who to show. Once the share guarantee has been met, we make the decision based upon what we think is going to be the best answer for the consumer because that's usually going to be the best answer for TripAdvisor. What I mean is we have to evaluate how good the content is, the quality of the room descriptions because the consumer wants to see that in order to hit the book button. We also care a lot about the price. And so whoever has the cheaper price is also going to have a higher conversion rate on our site. And then finally, the commission does come into play, you can imagine an extreme of somebody offering to pay a ridiculous 20% commission for a property while somebody else is offering to pay a 12%. If all other things are equal, then TripAdvisor is going to pick the 20% commission. That kind of maximizes us and does no harm to the consumer because, as I said, all the other aspects of the flow were equivalent. With the current OTAs, with Priceline, with the brands that we have with the Priceline Group, with eventually multiple brands from the Priceline Group, I think we'll have quite a choice as to who could fulfill the offer. And we'll look at it from mostly what's the best experience for the consumer and secondarily, who has a good commission to us. You should interpret that as at the end of the day, that combination is probably going to maximize TripAdvisor's revenue because I care the most about how many people are booking. And if I make a little bit less commission per booking but more people convert, we're going to make more money. The consumer is going to be happier and that's the win-win that we're looking for. So the second part of the question, the -- sort of who -- if I understand correctly, who gets the benefit of the brand placement in the booking flow, it's a bit -- from our perspective, it's too early to tell. We just haven't been in the marketplace long enough on enough of our platforms in order to see who might get -- and I'm not even sure how carefully I can measure, but I'm not sure who's going to get that second booking, the second trip, which tends not to happen the next day or even the next week. So we want to be very clear with all of our partners and certainly, our travelers, that it's -- Getaroom or that it's Booking.com that is powering --or Marriott, that is powering this transaction. They are the folks that you're going to go to when you want to make a change. Their the -- at Marriott, they are the owner of the property. They can answer the question faster than we can if the traveler has one. And if it's a second time booking for a similar property, we're certainly okay if that ends up being supplier direct. Our biggest opportunity is the traveler who comes to our site enjoys the reviews, sees the room tips, looks at a dozen different candid photos and says, ""Yes, this is the property I'm looking for. I like the price. Maybe I go down the Instant Book flow. I'd select the type of room, but I'm not ready to book right now."" And the next day or later in the week, when they're sure they want to take that trip, sure they want to stay in that property, they come back to TripAdvisor to finish the booking. And if we can close that leak, just that one piece of the -- plug the leak, a phenomenal huge win on TripAdvisor even if the partner that powers the transaction, the Marriott or the Priceline, wins the second booking because they have a great remarketing or retargeting campaign. Getting that first booking for us is -- obviously, I want both, but getting that first booking for us, by changing the mindset of the traveler, that's the biggest win that we see over the next couple of years."

So I don't -- I wouldn't claim yet that I have an answer as to how we can quickly change consumers' mindsets. I look back and say, ""TripAdvisor hasn't really had an awareness issue in most of our markets."" TV does a great job growing awareness, so we see how it's worked for so many other companies. But the other companies have tended to be at a different awareness stage or different growth stage, and so we went forward with TV knowing that it wasn't to move our awareness numbers but to educate folks on that one could now book on TripAdvisor. And it's been -- we did surveys on the TV and certainly, the book message stood out. But it was harder to see the behavior change on TripAdvisor. We saw more traffic. We made more money, but it was softer to draw the conclusion that it got people to actually complete a transaction, to book on TripAdvisor. So it would be, in my mind, no harm whatsoever in continuing a TV campaign that had the same message or -- I like the creative, but the same or different creative, nothing wrong with that. It couldn't possibly hurt. But in the judgment call of is that where we want to push on our branding and marketing for next year, we made the judgment call because you have to make this one in advance that says, so we're going to pause. I use the word pause carefully because I'm not saying we wouldn't change our mind. We wouldn't do something else in 2017 or maybe even late 2016, but the notion is that's not -- it's a big dollar bet, and that's not what we're going to spend those dollars on in '16. When we look at it from -- ""Wow, you have 100-plus million travelers on the site in a month,"" 150 million or 175 million, surely, that's a big enough sample size to work on the educational message. And recently, we've been doing quite a bit on that. So if you go to the site, many of our devices, not all, you'll see a much stronger you can book on TripAdvisor, combined with the appearance of a book on TripAdvisor button on hundreds of thousands of core [ph] properties, plus the global rollout plus being messaged from other brand communications that are different/cheaper than TV, we think that there's -- well, as I started with, a judgment call, there was nothing kind of wrong with the TV, but we think we can achieve our goals better in terms of training book by spending our time and some of our dollars elsewhere."

Priceline and Expedia were the 2 notable ones that had declined. And I think Priceline -- again, feel free to ask them. But in the ongoing discussions, we each made some compromises, and we found a common ground that allows them to get, obviously, what they are looking out of the relationship, which is a branded experience that makes sure customers know that Priceline is powering the booking. We are perfectly happy with that. They get to grow in transactions from our platform. And we, of course, get the Instant Book rolling out globally. We get the improved content from our display and hopefully, the improved conversion that comes with it. We can continue to show other OTAs and other suppliers in our store. We look forward to the remaining hotel brands joining in Instant Book. We look forward to having more Instant Book options across the board. We continue to sign up independent hotels at a decent pace. We're building our own content management system, as I mentioned, to make sure those properties are represented on our site with excellent content and strong pricing. And it's like what we've done with meta. We're building a really strong marketplace globally for lots of different folks, hotels or the intermediaries to be able to power the bookings of folks that choose to book on TripAdvisor. I take the opportunity to talk about Instant Booking and meta, and I will always refer to it as Instant Booking and meta. We love our Instant Book strategy. You've heard me talk about it over and over, but I don't want anyone to think that meta is going away. Our messaging of plan, compare and book -- plan, that's the reviews, the content that's the great decision support information that we have in order to help the consumer find exactly where they want to go, where they want to stay, what they want to do to have the great trip, that's the plan message. The compare is everyone's looking for the best price. Showing a price on TripAdvisor and Instant Booking is one of the options. And showing the price that is available elsewhere on the web from all the other players that the traveler is aware of is part of that core compare message. And we expect to have that compare message for the forever future. It's just part of our core positioning. And plan, compare and book. And we want TripAdvisor Instant Booking to offer a great price, terrific content, the trusted brand of TripAdvisor as to why you should click in, seeing the content and the brand provided by whoever is actually doing, powering the booking for us, the hotel itself or the high-quality travel agent like Priceline or any of the other OTAs that are in store, and they kind of complete that part of the purchase. And then the rest of the TripAdvisor value proposition, which we're still very excited about but we classify into our other businesses, the attractions and the restaurants and the other ways that are going to make a trip incredibly powerful. But it's Instant Booking and meta as that core monetization vehicle for hotels. It's restaurants and attractions and other services in the -- on the trip piece, it's vacation rentals and alternative lodging, in general, that helps people, well, when a hotel isn't quite what you're looking for, we have these other options, whether it be urban inventory that we're sourcing through our vacation rental, standard alternative lodging like the traditional vacation rental, those are all part of our store, and it's our job to -- our challenge or opportunity to present them at the right time to the travelers that are on our site. All in all, it's a pretty complete picture. It doesn't have everything, but when we look at the things that travelers are most interested, we have -- we would like to think the best offering in the plan space. We have a great offering in the compare space. We're learning how to have the best offering in the book space. We don't have it yet, but we're getting there. And we have the best offering in the in-destination market for attractions and restaurants globally. So that's a pretty good coverage of that life cycle. And I guess, the question started with Priceline, and so Priceline really helped us deliver on that book component. Thanks for the question.
All right. With that, I think we're a bit out of time. So let me say thank you very much. We're moving fast. We're making great progress on these long-term goals. And I have to say, I'm really fortunate to have a great team on the job. So to all of our employees throughout the entire TripAdvisor family, thank you again and again for your terrific work, for your hard work. It's showing results. I'm really proud. And I look forward to updating everyone again on the next quarter. Thank you."

I'm going to update you on our progress on how we're developing the best products for users, expanding our strong global platform to more partners and building a bigger and better business over the long term.
Our Q3 results clearly show the major impact currency headwinds are having on the business. Total revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% or 25% and 26% growth, respectively, in constant currency. As I'll describe in more detail later in my remarks, our results and business outlook also highlight that we were moving quickly in pursuit of our long-term goals to make TripAdvisor a great place to discover and book the things that make a trip memorable.
First, we'll talk about how TripAdvisor's consumer value proposition continues to strengthen in content, community and mobile. In content, with 290 million reviews and opinions on 5.3 million businesses around the world, TripAdvisor products are indispensable travel planning tools. Member growth has accelerated this year and those members are contributing content at a record pace of 190 per minute, the fastest growth in our history. This puts us on track to add another 100 million reviews and opinions over the next 12 months, making our travel planning products and tools fresher, richer and better for every user on every device in every geography.
Our global travel community also continues to grow as evidenced by unique monthly visitor growth of 23% and hotel shopper growth of 16%. Travelers can find information on more than 3.6 million restaurants and attractions, so it's no surprise that unique visitors to these pages continues to grow quickly. We attribute much of this growth in engagement to mobile, where TripAdvisor's helpful reviews, tips, photos and guides are the perfect travel companion.
Mobile usage makes up more than half of our traffic. In this quarter, we reached more than 230 million app downloads across our brands, including 215 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We're monetizing better on that platform as well as this quarter's hotel shoppers on phone monetized a 25% the rate of those on desktop, which is up nearly 40% since 2 years ago.
Perhaps more importantly, this speaks to the large mobile monetization opportunity in front of us. Mobile give us yet another powerful way to connect directly with consumers. Continuous iteration and innovation here is key and every TripAdvisor team is actively engaged in delivering more value to users and partners on these devices.
On any device, TripAdvisor users are close to making a purchase. In fact, a recent Oxford economic study estimates that TripAdvisor influenced more than 10% of global travel transactions in 2014, whether it's a hotel stay for a long weekend, a reservation for 2 at a hot new restaurant or tickets for a hop-on hop-off city tour, these are extremely powerful moments for advertisers as travel purchases tend to be extremely nuanced, contextual and episodic. TripAdvisor delivers the right ad or the right reservation opportunity to the right user at just the right moment at massive global scale.
As proud as we are in this growing influence, we believe that our revenue share represents only a small percentage of the transaction value we are driving for our partners. We are in year 1 of a multiyear voyage to plug this monetization leak, and we continue to make excellent progress. In hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group and the Priceline Group are the latest of a growing list of more than 70 hotel chains, groups and OTA partners who want to power bookings on our platform, including 7 of the top 10 brands -- top 10 hotel brands in the world.
In addition -- in particular, adding the Priceline Group to the platform is a huge win for our travelers as their high-quality room descriptions in many languages, multicurrency payment capabilities, great room pricing and stellar customer service enables us to accelerate our international rollout of Instant Booking over the coming year.
We expect to launch the Booking.com brand first, with the Priceline and Agoda brands to follow next year. Integration work has already begun, and I can tell you that I love what I'm seeing. And once we are fully live, we expect users will be able to seamlessly book more than 400,000 properties on our platform in more than a dozen languages.
We're also helping independent hoteliers drive more bookings on our platform. We're working with more than 130 Internet booking engine partners, and we expect to connect many of their hotel clients over time. Regardless of a partner's size or global reach, Instant Bookings can drive reservations at a fair cost, solve the media attribution issues that have persisted in the Internet for years and enable our hotelier clients to develop more direct relationships with more travelers.
Our Marriott integration serves as a perfect example. After signing the contract in June, we completed the rollout in less than 2 months and we have seen great early results, including improved conversion and more bookings for Marriott through our platform. As we add more globally recognized partners, we are further optimizing the booking experience on our site as well. This includes developing our own content management system for hotels and saving users' credit card information to make bookings faster and easier. I tip my hat to the entire Instant Booking team who has met this challenge head-on for meaningful conversion improvements over the past year.
Based upon these improvements and given how important Instant Booking is to our long-term goals, we accelerated the rollout to our users in 2 of our largest markets in September. We believe that this accelerated rollout schedule contributed headwinds of approximately $10 million to revenue and $8 million to EBITDA during Q3. We expect to be live in more major markets in the next year, and we'll continue to carefully monitor the opportunity costs associated with this faster international rollout. We know the Instant Book experience is working for users and partners.
The third piece of the puzzle is monetization for TripAdvisor. While not yet accretive, we believe that the faster we transition and teach travelers that they can book on TripAdvisor, the quicker we can plug the monetization leak. Fortunately, we have extremely smart and motivated teams who are up to the challenge. We've successfully transitioned away from pop-up windows, to successfully transitioning to metasearch, and I know that we will tackle this transition just as well.
On the marketing side, we're continuing to more deeply integrate the plan comparing book message into our online and offline channels. A big channel for us this past year has been TV. While we've seen success in many countries and we're pleased with our TV efforts over the past couple of years, we've decided to put this marketing channel on pause [ph] for 2016 while we focus more on the global rollout of Instant Booking. Instead, we expect to increase our investment in some of our other global brand-building efforts where we also better leverage our community, both on the consumer and B2B side to fuel our Book on TripAdvisor initiatives.
In addition to our opportunity in hotels, we're matching more consumers and businesses in our fast-growing attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals categories. Our content and community gives us the unique understanding of travelers, especially in attractions and restaurants, and we can delight more users at the exact moment that they're looking to find and book a great place to eat or a memorable thing to do.
These businesses constitute our other segment, which generated revenues of $75 million in the third quarter and $217 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over that time frame, we have been aggressively reinvesting profit to drive market share gains. We are just in the first year of what we have outlined as a 3- to 5-year growth initiative.
Shifting gears, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, the team and I are looking forward to welcoming Ernst Teunissen to TripAdvisor. Ernst brings significant financial and operational expertise as a global CFO and corporate strategist, and I look forward to collaborating with him as we pursue the significant growth opportunities ahead. He officially starts next week, and Julie will be with us through November 20 to ensure a smooth transition.
Before I close, 2015 has obviously been a tremendous year for our Book on TripAdvisor initiative. While still in the early days of this evolution, we continue to make tremendous strides towards our long-term growth objectives.
In closing, this is Julie's final earnings call with us, and I want to thank her again for all of her contributions over the past 4 years. I'd also like to thank all of our employees around the globe who build the products that users love and a more valuable platform for advertisers, positioning TripAdvisor for long-term success.
And now here's Julie."

This quarter, total revenue grew 17%. Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 9%. In constant currency, Q3 total revenue and EBITDA growth would have been 25% and 26%, respectively.
Our core hotel segment posted 8% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, and EBITDA margins held stable at 36%. Digging in, Q3 click-based revenue grew 6% or 14% in constant currency, driven by 16% hotel shopper growth and offset by continued pricing pressure, which includes impact from currency translation, lower CPC pricing and product changes we've made such as the decision to accelerate our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and U.K., our 2 largest markets. Revenue per hotel shopper growth reflects these headwinds as it decelerated to negative 10%. Normalizing for the significant year-over-year currency translation headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been better, though slight -- still slightly negative for the quarter due to a lower CPC pricing and the accelerated Instant Book rollout.
As a housekeeping item, note that during the third quarter, we improved our accounting methodology for unique users and hotel shoppers and have provided the recasted figures back through 2014 in the supplemental financial information tables, which are available on our IR site.
Our display-based business performed very well as revenue growth reaccelerated to 20%. These strong results were driven by 22% growth in ad impressions sold and we saw strength in the U.S. and EMEA markets with hotels, destination marketing organization and OTA customers in particular. Our display team continues to innovate this product offering, delivering great value to clients. As the currency environments stabilize, we expect that more clients will be in a position to leverage our scale in robust data management platform in their global ad campaigns.
Other segment revenue grew 92% in Q3, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins improved to positive 12% for the quarter, driven by high revenue seasonality in our attraction and vacation rental businesses.
We've operated this segment at EBITDA breakeven over the trailing 12 months and continue to reinvest aggressively in our products and sales efforts to drive long-term market share gains. We expect to see the typical seasonal step-down in Q4. And Q3 results, while strong, should not be taken as a new run rate in the near term. Over the long term, we believe margins will expand as we gain greater global scale.
As for expenses, selling and marketing delevered, primarily due to top line impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout and increased investment in our other segment businesses. We also had a full quarter of expenses related to our 2014 attraction acquisition last year, and we continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing resources to pursue our long-term growth objectives in our newer categories.
I'll note that the quarter also contained approximately $20 million in television advertising spend, which was consistent with both our Q2 investment as well as the year ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, we've decided to put this investment on pause in 2016 and intend to expand our investment in other brand marketing channels as we roll out Instant Book more broadly. On the other expense line, general and administrative expenses levered slightly, and tech and content grew in line with revenue as we continue to actively seek talent to pursue our growth initiatives.
On the bottom line, GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.51, which included the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries, which contributed $0.12 to our GAAP diluted EPS this quarter. This gain on sale was not included in our non-GAAP net income results of $0.53 per diluted share as the gain is not considered indicative of our ongoing operational results.
Moving to headcount. We ended Q3 with approximately 3,000 employees, up 9%, driven primarily by the investments we're making to grow our attraction and restaurant businesses. As for taxes, our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate of 25%, decreased primarily due to the changes in full year forecasted geographical mix, including a nontaxable gain related to the sale of Kuxun, one of our Chinese subsidiaries. We continue to expect GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 27% to 28%.
We generated $8 million of cash from operations during the quarter or 2% of revenue. This line continues to highlight the growth and seasonality of our transaction businesses, where we collect cash at the time of booking and payout to suppliers at the time of stay or when the ticket is used. CapEx for the quarter was $39 million or 9% of revenue, driven primarily by leasehold improvements, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth.
CapEx should step down significantly as a percentage of revenue moving forward now that we have taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. We now expect 2015 capital expenditures to be 7% of revenue. We continue to run a very capital-efficient business.
Liquidity remains strong as well with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balance of $730 million. We also have an undrawn balance of $708 million from our $1 billion credit facility and just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan.
Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged as we look to be opportunistic when it comes to making organic and inorganic discretionary growth investments. Online travel remains competitive, and we tend to view investments through a long-term lens versus near-term payback.
Looking forward, Q4 will have a full quarter impact from our accelerated Instant Booking rollout, and we expect to begin onboarding Booking.com later this quarter. As such, we now expect 2015 revenue growth in the high teens and slightly negative EBITDA growth. This revised outlook attempts to be appropriately conservative to reflect these changes as well as foreign exchange rates as of today. This outlook does not assume future positive or negative FX movements, conversion or monetization improvements.
We expect to roll out Instant Booking faster over the coming periods, which is great for our travelers and our long-term business prospects as we begin to plug the monetization leaks. Over the near term, it poses some forecasting challenges as we enable more properties, roll out to many more users around the globe and continue to improve the monetization of the product.
As Ernst settles in over the coming months, the team will determine how to evolve communication on future expectations as well as the metrics by which progress will be measured. The business is heading in the right direction, and I've enjoyed being part of the journey. I want to personally thank Steve and the entire TripAdvisor team for a great 4 years.

So the arc of conversion improvement, I would say, has been fairly steady since we launched over a year ago. Month in, month out, sometimes week in, week out, we're just making a constant improvement. I note, heads up, coming up is kind of step change because we're adding Priceline. Super excited about this deal with the Priceline Group because they offer a great brand, global inventory, tremendous content, kind of rich. And I've talked about this several times in the past, very rich written [ph] descriptions. And a lot of the information that our travelers are telling us they want to see on our site before they hit the book button. And at times, they have to leave our site, even when they've gone into the Instant Booking flow, because we haven't been able to provide everything that the customer is looking for. Booking.com or Expedia, for that matter, have tremendous content, have been able to provide that information. That's why the conversion rates on their sites are as good as they are. This deal allows us to bring in that rich information into our Instant Booking flow. And so we don't know the impact on the conversion rate and we'll know shortly as we roll it out, but that's really going to be a big difference maker in terms of if the slow and steady improvement that we've made upcome potential step change when we launch with Priceline Group. Having said that, we faced a choice last year in looking -- or this past year, in looking at the international rollout because it's been a challenge for us to figure out how to get the content that we need in all the languages and support all the currency types. All of a sudden, that challenge is addressed for us in this Priceline deal, and so it makes it just technically or practically feasible to roll it out. It adds additional uncertainty in our forecasting because while we have a decent amount of experience now in U.S. and U.K., we don't quite know how Instant Book is going to be flowing in France, in Japan, all throughout Asia, all throughout all the other markets that we look to roll it out in. Priceline has great content. We -- the partnership will work in all the countries, but we don't know the conversion impact relative to the meta [ph] prices that we have. Coming back up another level, we're really excited about what this does for the business. We've always said that we're ready to go it alone without an OTA partner because it was the right thing for the business. That was true. Having Priceline in the fold now just allows us to be able to go faster on the path that we were headed down anyways, and that faster has always been pretty important to for us. It is a big transition as we've gone through several in the past, and we're looking forward to not only the week-by-week improvement, but the step change function that we hope this Priceline deal will deliver. To the second part of your question, television, one of the reasons that we wanted to talk about television in this call is that TV is often a long term -- it's an advance buy. It's something that you need to plan in advance. And so while we're telling folks that we've decided to pull back for 2016 at least, we don't want anyone to think that, ""Hey, we're just taking all that money and hanging on to it."" We will be attempting -- we will be spending some of the money in other channels, and so we don't want anyone's model to just drop it to the bottom line. We haven't decided how much and of course, all throughout the year, we will be evaluating opportunities as they come up, but since TV was such long-term commitment, we had enough visibility into that specific decision."

We already have 350 million users on -- in our peak months. With all of that traffic, and I still think half of which being hotel traffic, that's such a great opportunity to plug the leak. And if we can do that and if we can monetize those hotel shoppers to the degree that any other OTA monetizes the hotel shoppers, that's a really big win for us. And while TV was meant to help that, we feel we actually already have the traveler on our site. And by doing other things on our site, we can also affect that, plug the leak. We also have an entire global world to look at. And so an extremely global TV educational campaign is hundreds of millions of dollars, but we already have the traffic that's live. And with the Priceline Group and our ability to roll out Instant Book globally, we want to sort of concentrate our firepower on delivering that plan, compare, book message, and plugging that leak after a traveler is already on our site."

We do think about those questions ourselves quite a bit, of course. The reason Priceline enables us to accelerate our Instant Book rollout globally is because of the rich content that they have on 400,000-plus properties all around the globe. And by that, I mean, if they are able to successfully take bookings on 400,000-plus properties in multiple, multiple different languages, processing payments for multiple different credit cards issued by multiple different banks, all sorts of things because they're such a strong sort of global hotel reservation player like Expedia. So I'm not saying that they're different there, I'm simply saying, they already have the ability for someone that lives in France or in Japan to come to their site to see the inventory that a traveler wants to stay in -- see all the room descriptions in the local language, make the bookings using the local credit cards. And we didn't have any of that for that customer in Japan, for instance, on TripAdvisor today. So if I were to roll out TripAdvisor today, I would be showing an Instant Book experience in English to that Japanese traveler. I would be showing a room description for a Marriott property in English for that -- Marriott might be a bad example because we might have Japanese content -- but an independent hotel or a different brand, we would be showing content in the wrong language to make it a highly converting experience. Priceline gives us all of that, one fell swoop in its highly strong curated content, payments and breadth of inventory. That allows us to push faster in IB. We hope for an improved conversion rate, travelers on our site going through that funnel because the experience is better. And so when we look, we will know shortly enough whether or not that yields a higher net revenue all the way to being accretive for us as we roll out Instant Book. I'm not sure being plus or minus, slightly accretive or slightly negative is going to influence the timing of the rollout. Per my earlier comments of -- we know this is the right thing to do for the traveler. We know this is the right thing to do for the long-term direction of TripAdvisor. We always stated we're willing to take some short-term hits along the way if it gets us to where we want to be, and we have 18 months of history where we have improved our conversion quarter after quarter after quarter so that we're confident. ""Hey, we're always going to be making progress. We may not always be as fast as or -- it may not always be instantly, but we'll get there."" And that's what gives us confidence to do a quick rollout even if it's not sort of instantly accretive. Hope that helped."

So the counting on the hotel shoppers, boy, if you can understand the challenge that us and every other web company goes through to figure out who, when visiting the site, is a real user versus a robot of type. And we do kind of our best job and we're always looking at the algorithms. And from time to time, we find that there's something that we missed. And in this particular case, we revamped the algorithm to cut out some of the traffic that we didn't think at the end of the day was real. So we're always trying to present you the most accurate metrics that we have. We recast them to see the year on-year over the past period. It obviously has no impact on revenue if we're scraping out -- we're filtering out traffic that wasn't real. So as a housekeeping footnote, you'll see the stuff has changed. I personally didn't pay any attention to it when I learned about it. In terms of last quarter, citing some weakness in Europe, I think we had a thesis at the time, based upon some of the evidence in front of us on sort of cross-border traffic and the weakness in the dollar. When we look at the macro issues in our past Q3, we're really pointing at Instant Book, the accelerated rollout, right, long-term decision, short term, a small amount of pain that we're certainly willing to take. And then we're looking at -- as we go forward, I mean, there is some pricing headwind that we see in our standard meta business. And it's a meta business, it's an auction. We don't set the price. Our clients bid up, bid down. There's more consolidation in the global space. There's a ton of different trends, not to mention currency, going on. At the end of the day, we believe our leads are just as qualified. So even if there's a bit of a pricing hit, it's not something that we can influence. But we can influence and really, what we're focused on is making IB as successful as it can be going forward. And that's why to double down, we're even more excited about the Priceline deal and its -- our ability to roll it out even quicker."

Q4, we're also seeing the full year of Instant Booking headwinds, which, as the team is working actively to optimize and make that accretive would there be expectation that, that would continue into 2016? And in addition to the monetization headwinds, there is a slight shift in the way revenue is recognized. So with the majority of our click-based revenue today, we recognize revenue on click immediately. As Instant Book becomes a more meaningful amount of revenue, we'll be -- experience a shift because with Instant Book, for the majority of our large partners, including the Priceline Group, we will be recognizing revenue on stay. So there'll be some seasonality and a shift in revenue as that becomes a more meaningful number. So that's something else to take into consideration in evaluating 2016. We're in the process of doing that ourselves, looking at booking windows and consumer behavior, and we'll make an estimate into our 2016 plan."

So I will know whether there are any changes in the display or the participation in meta by Priceline Group. Once they -- once everything's actually rolled out, I'm not under any impression that being in Instant Book would change anyone's participation in meta, let alone the Priceline Group. They've always expressed to us, as every client has, that they'd like as many transactions through our platform as possible. So I certainly would encourage you to ask the Priceline Group themselves, but my interpretation would be they are eager for all the traffic that they can get in meta just like they have in all the years past. They've been a phenomenal partner for us over many years and they're excited about the new transactions we'll be delivering through the Instant Book path. So it's kind of additive, and I think that's how the discussions have always been based, that it's additive to their thinking of how to maximize their participation in the TripAdvisor channel. To the second part of the question, which marketing channels are most efficient, we tend to look for as many marketing channels as we can find that deliver sort of quality traffic. And for the most part, we operate them on a breakeven basis. We view it as acquiring trial, and I'm talking about sort of ROI-generating online channels, be it search or retargeting or CPM or any of the other methods of acquiring -- methods of acquiring the traffic. Other marketing channels that we'll be working on offline, so many of them, it's nearly impossible to measure. We do quite a bit amount of ER. We do a fair amount of content licensing. We do a fair amount of other -- of engaging in various markets in -- by leveraging our B2B or B2C community. None of those have a direct ROI, but we spend serious dollars in them. And I think that's one of the reasons why, if you're ever traveling, you're likely to see something branded TripAdvisor along the way and a TripAdvisor rating, and we love all that. We don't even try to measure the marketing efficiency of those campaigns."

Over time, can you talk about the potential for Instant Book to evolve into an auction process and where it's similar to how meta works today? I know you can't about talk about the length of any deals or the terms, but how long might that take to -- for an auction to eventually become a reality? And then just secondly, I think maybe one of the reasons why your partners got comfortable with Instant Book, and correct me if I'm wrong, is because they get to feature their brand in the actual booking process, I assume, because it can lend itself to repeat customer economics over time. Obviously, that booking is still being made through Trip. So what can you tell us so far about which party might be accruing the benefit of those repeat economics over time?"

So as part of the sign-up process for an independent hotel on the website, there's 2 commission rates, a 12% and 15%. Then we offer the hotel sort of a guaranteed share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, what we call, eligible impress",880,"Certainly. So as part of the sign-up process for an independent hotel on the website, there's 2 commission rates, a 12% and 15%. Then we offer the hotel sort of a guaranteed share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, what we call, eligible impressions, so -- of the folks visiting their page basically. It's part of our sort of sales pitch that if you sign up, this is what we promise you. It can well be a lot more than that depending on a lot of different factors. And so going forward, that independent who has signed up, even at a 15% commission, TripAdvisor has -- once the Booking.com deal is live as of -- or even today with our current OTA partners, we make a choice at run time that as -- beyond the share guarantee, do I wish to show -- get a room as an OTA for that hotel or the hotel itself or Tingo has an OTA for the hotel. So for any particular property, I might already have 3 or more auction -- 3 or more participants in Instant Book. We make the decision based on who to show. Once the share guarantee has been met, we make the decision based upon what we think is going to be the best answer for the consumer because that's usually going to be the best answer for TripAdvisor. What I mean is we have to evaluate how good the content is, the quality of the room descriptions because the consumer wants to see that in order to hit the book button. We also care a lot about the price. And so whoever has the cheaper price is also going to have a higher conversion rate on our site. And then finally, the commission does come into play, you can imagine an extreme of somebody offering to pay a ridiculous 20% commission for a property while somebody else is offering to pay a 12%. If all other things are equal, then TripAdvisor is going to pick the 20% commission. That kind of maximizes us and does no harm to the consumer because, as I said, all the other aspects of the flow were equivalent. With the current OTAs, with Priceline, with the brands that we have with the Priceline Group, with eventually multiple brands from the Priceline Group, I think we'll have quite a choice as to who could fulfill the offer. And we'll look at it from mostly what's the best experience for the consumer and secondarily, who has a good commission to us. You should interpret that as at the end of the day, that combination is probably going to maximize TripAdvisor's revenue because I care the most about how many people are booking. And if I make a little bit less commission per booking but more people convert, we're going to make more money. The consumer is going to be happier and that's the win-win that we're looking for. So the second part of the question, the -- sort of who -- if I understand correctly, who gets the benefit of the brand placement in the booking flow, it's a bit -- from our perspective, it's too early to tell. We just haven't been in the marketplace long enough on enough of our platforms in order to see who might get -- and I'm not even sure how carefully I can measure, but I'm not sure who's going to get that second booking, the second trip, which tends not to happen the next day or even the next week. So we want to be very clear with all of our partners and certainly, our travelers, that it's -- Getaroom or that it's Booking.com that is powering --or Marriott, that is powering this transaction. They are the folks that you're going to go to when you want to make a change. They're the -- at Marriott, they are the owner of the property. They can answer the question faster than we can if the traveler has one. And if it's a second time booking for a similar property, we're certainly okay if that ends up being supplier direct. Our biggest opportunity is the traveler who comes to our site enjoys the reviews, sees the room tips, looks at a dozen different candid photos and says, ""Yes, this is the property I'm looking for. I like the price. Maybe I go down the Instant Book flow. I'd select the type of room, but I'm not ready to book right now."" And the next day or later in the week, when they're sure they want to take that trip, sure they want to stay in that property, they come back to TripAdvisor to finish the booking. And if we can close that leak, just that one piece of the -- plug the leak, a phenomenal huge win on TripAdvisor even if the partner that powers the transaction, the Marriott or the Priceline, wins the second booking because they have a great remarketing or retargeting campaign. Getting that first booking for us is -- obviously, I want both, but getting that first booking for us, by changing the mindset of the traveler, that's the biggest win that we see over the next couple of years."

I look back and say, ""TripAdvisor hasn't really had an awareness issue in most of our markets."" TV does a great job growing awareness, so we see how it's worked for so many other companies. But the other companies have tended to be at a different awareness stage or different growth stage, and so we went forward with TV knowing that it wasn't to move our awareness numbers but to educate folks on that one could now book on TripAdvisor. And it's been -- we did surveys on the TV and certainly, the book message stood out. But it was harder to see the behavior change on TripAdvisor. We saw more traffic. We made more money, but it was softer to draw the conclusion that it got people to actually complete a transaction, to book on TripAdvisor. So it would be, in my mind, no harm whatsoever in continuing a TV campaign that had the same message or -- I like the creative, but the same or different creative, nothing wrong with that. It couldn't possibly hurt. But in the judgment call of is that where we want to push on our branding and marketing for next year, we made the judgment call because you have to make this one in advance that says, so we're going to pause. I use the word pause carefully because I'm not saying we wouldn't change our mind. We wouldn't do something else in 2017 or maybe even late 2016, but the notion is that's not -- it's a big dollar bet, and that's not what we're going to spend those dollars on in '16. When we look at it from -- ""Wow, you have 100-plus million travelers on the site in a month,"" 150 million or 175 million, surely, that's a big enough sample size to work on the educational message.

Priceline and Expedia were the 2 notable ones that had declined. And I think Priceline -- again, feel free to ask them. But in the ongoing discussions, we each made some compromises, and we found a common ground that allows them to get, obviously, what they are looking out of the relationship, which is a branded experience that makes sure customers know that Priceline is powering the booking. We are perfectly happy with that. They get to grow in transactions from our platform. And we, of course, get the Instant Book rolling out globally. We get the improved content from our display and hopefully, the improved conversion that comes with it. We can continue to show other OTAs and other suppliers in our store. We look forward to the remaining hotel brands joining in Instant Book. We look forward to having more Instant Book options across the board. We continue to sign up independent hotels at a decent pace. We're building our own content management system, as I mentioned, to make sure those properties are represented on our site with excellent content and strong pricing. And it's like what we've done with meta. We're building a really strong marketplace globally for lots of different folks, hotels or the intermediaries to be able to power the bookings of folks that choose to book on TripAdvisor. I take the opportunity to talk about Instant Booking and meta, and I will always refer to it as Instant Booking and meta. We love our Instant Book strategy. You've heard me talk about it over and over, but I don't want anyone to think that meta is going away. Our messaging of plan, compare and book -- plan, that's the reviews, the content that's the great decision support information that we have in order to help the consumer find exactly where they want to go, where they want to stay, what they want to do to have the great trip, that's the plan message. The compare is everyone's looking for the best price. Showing a price on TripAdvisor and Instant Booking is one of the options. And showing the price that is available elsewhere on the web from all the other players that the traveler is aware of is part of that core compare message. And we expect to have that compare message for the forever future. It's just part of our core positioning. And plan, compare and book. And we want TripAdvisor Instant Booking to offer a great price, terrific content, the trusted brand of TripAdvisor as to why you should click in, seeing the content and the brand provided by whoever is actually doing, powering the booking for us, the hotel itself or the high-quality travel agent like Priceline or any of the other OTAs that are in store, and they kind of complete that part of the purchase. And then the rest of the TripAdvisor value proposition, which we're still very excited about but we classify into our other businesses, the attractions and the restaurants and the other ways that are going to make a trip incredibly powerful. But it's Instant Booking and meta as that core monetization vehicle for hotels. It's restaurants and attractions and other services in the -- on the trip piece, it's vacation rentals and alternative lodging, in general, that helps people, well, when a hotel isn't quite what you're looking for, we have these other options, whether it be urban inventory that we're sourcing through our vacation rental, standard alternative lodging like the traditional vacation rental, those are all part of our store, and it's our job to -- our challenge or opportunity to present them at the right time to the travelers that are on our site. All in all, it's a pretty complete picture. It doesn't have everything, but when we look at the things that travelers are most interested, we have -- we would like to think the best offering in the plan space. We have a great offering in the compare space. We're learning how to have the best offering in the book space. We don't have it yet, but we're getting there. And we have the best offering in the in-destination market for attractions and restaurants globally. So that's a pretty good coverage of that life cycle. And I guess, the question started with Priceline, and so Priceline really helped us deliver on that book component. Thanks for the question.
All right. With that, I think we're a bit out of time. So let me say thank you very much. We're moving fast. We're making great progress on these long-term goals. And I have to say, I'm really fortunate to have a great team on the job. So to all of our employees throughout the entire TripAdvisor family, thank you again and again for your terrific work, for your hard work. It's showing results. I'm really proud. And I look forward to updating everyone again on the next quarter. Thank you."
