Madden NFL Mobile has its biggest game in franchise history on Christmas Day reaching #4 on the top grossing chart in the U.S. Apple App Store, and we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console games publisher, a testament to the strength and breadth of EA's IP. Our excellent financial results reflect the strong player engagement and critical success of our titles. 
Revenue and earnings for Q3 were beyond our guidance, and we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. At the core, we continue to focus on putting players first. As we listen, learn and deliver for our communities with games and services that they love to pay, we are experiencing new milestones and engagement. On console and PC platforms above, more than 3.1 billion hours were spent playing EA games in Q3.

More than 113 million hours have already been spent exploring the depth and detail of the single-payer experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition, and more players are joining each day. Named Game of the Year by 32 media outlets around the world, including IGN, Gaming Format and the Associated Press, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a true masterpiece from a team of BioWare and again, that is sure to be played for a long time to come. 
FIFA 15 and Madden NFL 15 also continued to deliver for fans in our third quarter. FIFA 15 was the #1 title in Europe and a top 10 title in the U.S. in 2014 with engagement growing in Q3. There were nearly 50% more users logging in each week as compared to Q3 last year.

Our Maxis GPO delivered 3 major game updates to The Sims -- in Q3, providing some new content and adding some of the most wanted community features. Each update is driven more players to engage with The Sims 4, and we are planting to continue delivering first content and gameplay to the vibrant community.

Our EA SPORTS title are enjoying more sports fans in the mobile games averaging more than 45 million monthly active users during the quarter. Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team of -- away averaging 45% monthly players are through Q3 compared to our previous iterations in the same period last year.

27963,281186370,749581,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior years, which included the launch of a Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, str",1434,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior years, which included the launch of a Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, strong title performance and expense control drove operating margins up significantly this quarter with 36.3% from 33.8% last year. And this resulted in an excellent cash generation and earnings. This extraordinary performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and Dragon Age: Inquisition. In particular, Dragon Age: Inquisition have, by far, the most successful launch in BioWare's history, exceeding our expectations. In addition, game sales for less generation consoles were also much stronger when we anticipated. FX make a few revenue by about $20 million this quarter, but our program offset about half of this and combined with a natural hedging from our international operations, largely neutralized this impact on earnings. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 34.4% year-over-year to $693 million, 49% of this quarter's revenue and a new high. The trailing 12-month the digital net revenue was also a record, up 17% to $2.18 billion. This is the first-time digital sales have generated more than half our revenue in a 12-month period. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and a premium contributed $314 million, up of 47% over the prior year, with Ultimate Team continuing its strong performance across our FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL franchises, up 82% year-over-year in total. FIFA Online 3 in Korea continues to grow year-over-year, and the early litigations from our partner in China, Tencent, are that it is already a forming it's terribly well. Star Wars of The Old Republic also contracted to the segment with the expansion the Shadows of Raven, attracting many more people into the game with its epic storyline. Star Wars remains deeply engage in The Old Republic universe and we're more excited to see how that will build as we get closer to the launch of the Star Wars movie this December. 
Mobile generated a record $139 million in the quarter, up 13% over the prior period. $125 million or 90% of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 28% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the freemium business. Premium full game download revenue was just $14 million down the 44% compared to the prior year. Mobile had a strong December in particular, driven by the success of SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team mobile as well as the continued strength of the rest of our mobile portfolio. Leveraging proven IP like this reduces of the cost of player acquisition and drive of the long-term profitability of our mobile business. SimCity BuildIt has proven to be a highly engaging title that has been a top 10 grossing 1 on iPhone in 85 countries and on iPad in more than 100. Full game PC and console downloads and generated $140 million in revenue, up 22% over the prior year, driven by growth in the installed base PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Although the percentage vary considerably by title, platform and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues. Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $100 million, up 52% over the same period last year. The primary growth driver was Battlefield 4 Premium revenues, EA Access, our subscription for Xbox 1 continues to grow and we're seeing subscribers play more games, engage more broadly with the EA's offerings. 
Moving onto gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 72.8%, an increase from last year's 68.1% and better than our guidance of 70.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to the growth in our digital business, strength encourage generation consoles and a onetime benefit from an -- revenue deferred to the second quarter. This was partially offset by the higher proportion of sales from a royalty-bearing titles in the quarter compared to last year's Q3. Outperformance versus our outlook was driven by the record-breaking Dragon Age: Inquisition performance. In addition, sell-through was extremely healthy across the market, enabling us to maintain margin above our expectations while keeping channel inventory clean. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense in the quarter were $521 million, down 4% year-on-year. $19 million below prior year, but $6 million above our guidance. Compared to last year, we were able to continue to reduce advertising spend by focusing on a few were frontline titles and increasing the efficiency of the way we advertise. This was partially offset by an increase in the accruals we made from a variable compensation and legal expenses, which were not in our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.22 per share, $0.32 better than guidance due to strong revenue, higher gross margin and continued cost control. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were 2.94 billion -- or approximately $9.48 per share. 56 of this cash is short-term investment balance, which help on sure. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter were $682 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $1.15 billion, a record for this period. 
During Q3, we repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $97 million. As a reminder, our $750 million buyback was initiated in May 2014 and has a 2-year time frame. The current rate of purchase keeps us on track to complete the full $750 million in that time. 
Turning to guidance. We're increasing our full year guidance. For fiscal year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $78 million to $4.253 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will be increased by $0.30 to $2.35 per share. This resulted in expected operating margin of nearly 24%. Although this guidance passed through essentially all the Q3 earnings outperformance for the full year, it does not pass through all the revenue. The reduction in our Q4 revenue expectation is based on uncertainty around future currency movements and the decision to move EA SPORTS, PGA TOUR and the first Sims 4 expansion pack into fiscal '16. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when we will start to recognize revenue from a FIFA Online 3 in China. However, gross margin improvement and continued expense control offset this conservatism in revenue, allowing us to substantially reaffirm our Q4 earnings expectation. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.485 billion in revenue and $2.57 in fully diluted EPS. 
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.05 billion, which will be the largest fiscal year cash flow in the company's history. Our capital expend forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $950 million. Guidance for our fourth quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $830 million, a 9% decrease compared to last year's $914 million. Year-on-year difference is largely driven by Battlefield 4 catalogue sales, which were very strong in Q4 fiscal '14. The quarter, we immediately after we ship to Battlefield. 
Our next major launch title, Battlefield Hardline, we'll start to ship the 3rd-week of March, so it's impact on the quarter will be limited, even though we expected this to build into a significant title through the next fiscal year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 74%. We expect our Q4 operating expenses to be $515 million on a non-GAAP basis. This resulted in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.22 per share as compared to $0.48 last year. Our Q4 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.16 billion as compared to $1.12 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.07 as compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year. We're pleased with our third quarter results and, most importantly, with the consistent growth of cash flow and earnings. We're well ahead of where we expect to be at this stage of the transformation, largely as a result of the strength of our digital lives of is a strategy, our ability to control costs and the continued great commitment of our employees to drive performance. But there's plenty more of opportunities ahead of us. We expect these factors will continue to drive growth and cash flow earnings and to be augmented by a growing mobile business as we continue to apply our core IP at this platform. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

As regards current gen or Xbox 360 PS3 platforms, we saw about $100 million in incremental revenue in Q3 on those platforms, I think driven by number of factors. I think it's being great value for consumers to pick those consuls up at this page in their life cycle. I think Sony and Microsoft continue to support them well. There's a great portfolio of titles.

And so often times, we don't see the pickup in full game downloads until after people have played their first round of games they've gotten for Christmas presents.

We have hedging program in place where the objective is to reduce the impact of currency moves on operating income and cash flow.

And we tend to focus on 4 core courses, the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Swedish kroner, which are really go for core centers of where we have employees as well as where our core revenue exist. We are exposed to other currencies beyond that because they're not as large in the overall mix. The reality is that we're able to hedge our revenue but rarely can we hedge 100% of that. We're able to hedge partially because of actual hedges and partially because of natural hedges more of our operating income swing to see a larger swing on the top line and we do in the bottom line. This quarter, we saw virtually no impact on the bottom line and as I said about a $20 million impact on the top line. The real unknown for us going forward is exactly what we think operating or the euro is going to look like 6 to 9 months after where our hedges are less impactful going forward. We'll know more when we give guidance in May for the full year. We see a little risk in the fourth quarter if you see continued decline in euro.

The new boost that we have through with this quarter on what with Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 is also very good for us. Again, we have a very, very strong portfolio of titles. And we would expect that we will continue to benefit as a both generations of consoles continue to show strength and growth, albeit for different markets, given the breath and the strength of our portfolio. In addition to that, we're seeing continued engagement with our live services and players playing longer and engaging deeper with those live services across a both generations of console. And as we've talked about, we have very strong quarter with respect to mobile, and we're starting to see the value of our IP combined with the learning experiences that we've had over the past couple of years with respect to mobile. So all in all, when we think about 2 console generations of strength, we think about ongoing engagement with our live services and we start to see there's -- the benefit of the learning and the strength of our portfolio of mobile. We feel very good about the year ahead."

And through focus of the entire organization and the former management team, we are really pushed the change on how we operate, both from a consumer perspective, very focused on the gamer-first mentality and second, on a financial perspective. And that's allowed us to move into what looks like now, roughly 24% operating margin for the year with obviously this quarter showing operating margins well into the mid-30s. We do believe that we've got potential continued upside on the gross margin side of the business as we finish our digital business. And as we add more and more revenue via either digital live services or mobile, we think that will continue to benefit through some operating leverage and give us more operating upside. We kind of view the first stage of this change as the turnaround.

So smaller portion of people to buy the game less than half of people actually entering to Ultimate Team and a small fraction of those people actually get heavily involved in Ultimate Team and ultimately monetize.

And you'll start to see more and more screens and more and more live game over the few weeks as we start to crank the marketing activities and, obviously, the beta that Andrew mentioned. So more to come there, it's pretty exciting now. On the gross margin side, NHL was under $50 million in terms of revenues that was deferred into the quarter. And so that really probably took gross margins up by about 1 point relative to the overall -- over delivery of gross margin. And so it obviously, helped us that's why we wanted to call it out. We did that because we have more to deliver on NHL than we did during the quarter and that's why we differed some of the NHL revenue. I think longer term, gross margin, more to come when we give guidance next year, but we do believe that we could operate in 30 -- or excuse me, 72% to 74% gross margin longer term.

So think about it as effectively trying to minimize the swings in exchange rate. The impact of the swings in exchange rates on our P&L, on our balance sheet. We don't try to play bets, to try to make money on hedges. We simply are trying to offset swings that could occur. So ideally for us, it would be for constantly neutral, any currency moves. Obviously, that's hard to do and it gets expensive. And so when you see rapid changes in FX like we've seen in the last 6 weeks, it's harder to be able to protect against that over a long-term period of time. It just gets very expensive to do.

Dragon Age: Inquisition was named to more than 200 game of the year list globally. More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week across the world. Madden NFL Mobile has its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching #4 on the top grossing chart in the U.S. Apple App Store, and we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console games publisher, a testament to the strength and breadth of EA's IP. Our excellent financial results reflect the strong player engagement and critical success of our titles. 
Revenue and earnings for Q3 were beyond our guidance, and we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. At the core, we continue to focus on putting players first. As we listen, learn and deliver for our communities with games and services that they love to play, we're experiencing new milestones in engagement. On console and PC platforms alone, more than 3.1 billion hours were spent playing EA games in Q3. Dragon Age: Inquisition captivated fans and critics worldwide as it launched in November, and it quickly became the most successful launch in BioWare history. More than 113 million hours have already been spent exploring the depth and detail of the single-player experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition, and more players are joining each day. Named Game of the Year by 32 media outlets around the world, including IGN, Gaming Format and the Associated Press, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a true masterpiece from the team at BioWare, and again, that is sure to be played for a long time to come. 
FIFA 15 and Madden NFL 15 also continued to deliver for fans in our third quarter. FIFA 15 was the #1 title in Europe and a top 10 title in the U.S. in 2014, with engagement growing in Q3. There were nearly 50% more users logging in each week as compared to Q3 last year. Meanwhile, Madden NFL 15 was the #2 best-selling title in North America for 2014 across the whole genres and gameplay hours were up 30% year-on-year in Q3. 
In our Ultimate Team services, engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year. Our Maxis studio delivered 3 major game updates to The Sims 4 in Q3, providing fun new content and adding some of the most wanted community features. Each update has driven more players to engage with The Sims 4, and we are planting to continue delivering fresh content and gameplay to the vibrant Sims community. EA Mobile had a breakout performance over the holiday period. Our EA SPORTS titles are drawing more sports fans in the mobile games, averaging more than 45 million monthly active users during the quarter. Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team led the way, averaging 45% more monthly players through Q3 compared to our previous iterations in the same period last year. 
The newly launched the SimCity BuildIt was downloaded more than 22 million time in the first month, reached the top 5 iOS game downloads in more than 100 countries and to date, players have already logged more than 1.2 billion gameplay sessions. New games like Madden NFL Mobile, FIFA 15 Ultimate Team and SimCity BuildIt as well as perennial fan favorites like Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay and The Simpsons: Tapped Out, demonstrate one of our key opportunities in mobile, leveraging our IP and specifically designing experiences from the ground up for players and mobile devices. We are listening and learning from the feedback in our mobile community, tuning the experiences based on testing and soft launch periods then keeping players entertained with new content and challenges. Overall, the momentum that we're seeing across different platforms today gives us great reason to be excited for the future. 
On consoles, the installed base on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 continues to show strong growth. While new players joining on previous-generation consoles are also tapping into our amazing IP catalog. On mobile, innovative games are opening up new growth genres like sports, with highly engaged players. On PC, our Origin service continues to grow fiscal year-to-date and offer exciting new ways to play. Across all of these platforms, live services are extending the experience and bringing players deeper into the games they love. 
With the dynamite nature of this industry, platform preferences, player interest, play patents and game experiences were constantly evolved. We are confident that through our efforts to put players first, to continue to digitally transform our business and to operate faster and more focused team, we will be in a position of strength to make these industry changes our greatest opportunity. 
I'll now hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at Q3 financial performance, then I'll return with a few final thoughts."
27963,281186370,749663,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior years, which included the launch of Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, stron",1415,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior years, which included the launch of Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, strong title performance and expense control drove operating margins up significantly this quarter to 36.3% from 33.8% last year. And this resulted in an excellent cash generation and earnings. This extraordinary performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and Dragon Age: Inquisition. In particular, Dragon Age: Inquisition have, by far, the most successful launch in BioWare's history, exceeding our expectations. In addition, game sales for last-generation consoles were also much stronger than we had anticipated. FX negatively impacted revenue by about $20 million this quarter, but our hedging program offset about half of this and combined with the natural hedging from our international operations, largely neutralized this impact on earnings. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 34% year-over-year to $693 million, 49% of this quarter's revenue and a new high. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was also a record, up 17% to $2.18 billion. This is the first time digital sales have generated more than half our revenue in a 12-month period. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $314 million, up 47% over the prior year, with Ultimate Team continuing its strong performance across our FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL franchises, up 82% year-over-year in total. FIFA Online 3 in Korea continues to grow year-over-year, and the early indications from our partner in China, Tencent, are that it is already performing extremely well. Star Wars: The Old Republic also contributed to the segment with the expansion, Shadow of Revan, attracting many more people into the game with its epic new storyline. Star Wars fans remain deeply engaged in The Old Republic universe and were more excited to see how that will build as we get closer to the launch of the Star Wars movie this December. 
Mobile generated a record $139 million in the quarter, up 13% over the prior year. $125 million or 90% of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 28% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the freemium business. Freemium full game download revenue was just $14 million, down 44% compared to the prior year. Mobile had a strong December in particular, driven by the success of SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team mobile as well as the continued strength of the rest of our mobile portfolio. Leveraging proven IP like this reduces the cost of player acquisition and drive the long-term profitability of our mobile business. SimCity BuildIt has proven to be a highly engaging title that has been a top 10 grossing one on iPhone in 85 countries and on iPad in more than 100. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $140 million in revenue, up 22% over the prior year, driven by growth in the installed base of PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Although the percentage vary considerably by titles, platform and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues. Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $100 million, up 52% over the same period last year. The primary growth driver was Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access, our subscription service for Xbox One, continues to grow and we're seeing subscribers play more games, engage more broadly with EA's offerings. 
Moving onto gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 72.8%, an increase from last year's 68.1% and better than our guidance of 70.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to the growth in our digital business, strength in current-generation consoles and a onetime benefit from NHL revenue deferred to the second quarter. This was partially offset by the higher proportion of sales from royalty-bearing titles in the quarter compared to last year's Q3. Out-performance versus our outlook was driven by the record-breaking Dragon Age: Inquisition performance. In addition, sell-through was extremely healthy across the market, enabling us to maintain margins above our expectations while keeping channel inventory clean. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense in the quarter were $521 million, down 4% year-on-year. $19 million below prior year, but $6 million above our guidance. Compared to last year, we were able to continue to reduce advertising spend by focusing on fewer frontline titles and increasing the efficiency of the way we advertise. This was partially offset by an increase in the accruals we made from variable compensation and legal expenses, which were not in our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.22 per share, $0.32 better than guidance due to strong revenue, higher gross margin and continued cost control. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.94 billion or approximately $9.48 per share. 66 of this cash is short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter were $682 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $1.15 billion, a record for this period. 
During Q3, we repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $97 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May 2014, and has a 2-year timeframe. The current rate of purchase keeps us on track to complete the full $750 million in that time. 
Turning to guidance. We're increasing our full year guidance. For fiscal year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $78 million to $4.253 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will be increased by $0.30 to $2.35 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of nearly 24%. Although this guidance passes through essentially all of the Q3 earnings outperformance for the full year, it does not pass through all the revenue. The reduction in our Q4 revenue expectation is based on uncertainty around future currency movements and the decision to move EA SPORTS, PGA TOUR and the first Sims 4 expansion pack into fiscal '16. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when we will start to recognize revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China. However, gross margin improvement and continued expense control offset this conservatism in revenue, allowing us to substantially reaffirm our Q4 earnings expectation. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.485 billion in revenue and $2.57 in fully diluted EPS. 
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.05 billion, which would be the largest fiscal year cash flow in the company's history. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $950 million. Guidance for our fourth quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $830 million, a 9% decrease compared to last year's $914 million. Year-on-year difference is largely driven by Battlefield 4 catalog sales, which were very strong in Q4 fiscal '14, the quarter immediately after we shipped Battlefield. 
Our next major launch title, Battlefield Hardline, will start to ship the 3rd week of March, so its impact on the quarter will be limited, even though we expect it to build into a significant title through next fiscal year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 74%. We expect our Q4 operating expenses to be $515 million on a non-GAAP basis. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.22 per share as compared to $0.48 last year. Our Q4 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.16 billion as compared to $1.12 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.07 as compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year. We're pleased with our third quarter results, and most importantly, with the consistent growth of cash flow and earnings. We're well-ahead of where we expected to be at this stage of our transformation, largely as a result in the strength of our digital live services strategy, our ability to control costs and the continued great commitment of our employees to drive performance. But there's plenty more opportunities ahead of us. We expect these factors will continue to drive growth and cash flow and earnings and to be augmented by a growing mobile business as we continue to apply our core IP in this platform. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

It was a great Q3 and is more to excited about as we look to Q4 and beyond. The launch of Battlefield Hardline will be the culmination of efforts by the team at Visceral and across EA to engage our players and deliver a rich and innovative new experience. Battlefield Hardline is a fresh combination of speed, story and strategy, a mix of an engaging single player campaign inspired by popular TV dramas, new speed-based multiplayer experiences and classic Battlefield multiplayer modes. We're getting great response to the game in recent play test and we look forward to opening up to the community with the upcoming multiplayer beta. This is a fast, fun and intense new experience and we think players are going to love it. We look forward to launching this new take on Battlefield beginning on March 17. 
Our flight for the coming year demonstrates EA's commitment to exciting players through brand-new experiences as well as our live services. Players in our current experiences including Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Sims 4, the EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield 4, will continue to see updates and new content in the future. We will now launch PGA TOUR in Q1 FY '16, in line with some of the golf's biggest tournaments and it will be joined by a lineup of annual EA SPORTS titles next year. Our Need for Speed franchise will return in FY '16, with, again, that is already looking spectacular. And of course, the new blockbuster Star Wars Battlefront is set to release in the holiday quarter this year. 
We'll share our full FY '16 calendar, including a sleight of new mobile games during our next quarterly call. 
I said earlier in the call that the very nature of the games industry is that it is dynamic and constantly evolving. This plays to the strength of Electronic Arts. Change is one of the constant in history of this company and we continue to change ourselves to listen, learn and lead an exciting new future for gaming and for our players. You'll see us focus on our player relationships to engage and understand what inspires each gamers are playing. You'll see us investing in new IP and innovation from ground-up new experiences to cutting edge digital services. And you'll see us focus on quality at every turn. Stability in our services and delivery of long-lasting fun with games that are played for months and years, not just days or weeks. 
Throughout FY '15, EA has focused on putting our players first and strengthening the foundation of our business. We now look forward to a strong finish in Q4 and carrying momentum from FY '15 into FY '16. 
Now, Blake, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions."

As I've said on previous calls, we're seeing about 15% of our sales come from full game downloads via primarily the Sony and Microsoft platforms, of course, as well as our Origin platform. I will say, in the last couple of weeks, to your question, that we've seen an interesting and encouraging pickup in our sports titles in particular where we're seeing a significant increase above that number for full game downloads on the console and PC platforms. As regards current gen or Xbox 360, PS3 platforms, we saw about $100 million in incremental revenue in Q3 on those platforms. I think, driven by a number of factors. I think, it's being great value for consumers to pick those consoles up at this stage in their life cycle. I think, Sony and Microsoft continue to support them well. There's a great portfolio of titles. And in particular, what Electronic Arts brings is blockbuster IP that gamers are very familiar with and they're relatively easy purchases.

I think, you'd asked trying to get a sense of how much of that was coming from bundling. We did have some bundles in the quarter but not substantially more than we would normally have. So the real full game download trend is being driven primarily by full game downloads on the new generation consoles. One phenomenon that we do see in the Christmas holiday was that people like to give physical gifts that sit under the tree or wherever you're doing your gift-giving. And so oftentimes, we don't see the pickup in full game downloads until after people have played their first round of games they've gotten for Christmas presents. And Peter's point was we've seen just most recent pickup in the last couple of weeks of full game downloads, which were tied back to the notion that people are now starting to really understand the power of their new consoles and starting to pick that up."

And in addition, we actually get a natural hedge based on the fact that we have substantial number of employees and offices in Europe as well as in Canada. And we tend to focus on 4 core currencies, the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Swedish kroner, which are really the 4 core centers of where we have employees as well as where our core revenue exist. We're exposed to other currencies beyond that because they're not as large in the overall mix. The reality is that we're able to hedge our revenue but rarely can we hedge 100% of that. We're able to hedge partially because of actual hedges and partially because of natural hedges more of our operating income swing. So we'll tend to see a larger swing on the top line than we do on the bottom line. This quarter, we saw virtually no impact on the bottom line, and as I said, about a $20 million impact on the top line. The real unknown for us going forward is exactly what we think operating or the euro is going to look like 6 to 9 months out where our hedges are less impactful going forward. We'll know more when we give guidance in May for the full year. We see a little risk in the fourth quarter if you see continued decline in euro.

We do believe that we've got potential continued upside on the gross margin side of the business as we push our digital business.

And then, second, the growth in Ultimate Team compares to the mobile business, which around 13% is tracking below the digital average. Can you talk about your plan to either reaccelerate that business or feature phones, are there still a headwind that we should be looking at going forward?"

Why don't I start it, then I can toss it to Frank. The one reminder is growth -- underlying growth in mobile is really 28% if you pull that premium business out, which is a legacy for us, it's down to about $14 million a year and declining year-over-year. We can't force it out any faster than we're already doing because it's embedded in a lot of where people play games still. But Frank can talk about the exciting growth idea that -- as well as growth that we're seeing in the mobile business. First, just on the Ultimate Team side of the equation, the key for us in Ultimate Team right now has been discovery, making sure people understand what it is and how exciting and fun it is. Still a smaller portion than -- of all the people that buy the game, less than half the people actually enter into Ultimate Team and a small fraction of those people actually get heavily involved in Ultimate Team and ultimately monetize. And so part of our goal is increasing visibility of Ultimate Team and making sure that people understand how to play it and how fun it is. So you see, when you load up the Madden disc for the first time, you see Ultimate Team come up on your screen. We're trying to make sure people understand, get into the funnel essentially and understand how passionate and powerful it is as you start to play it. And we're trying to encourage people to play with their friends and so you'll see more and more of that drive Ultimate Team. Clearly, as the scale today that you question how much larger can it get, but we're surprised every quarter about the continued growth and we do know particularly how much people love and particularly how much opportunity there could still be going forward. So exciting times ahead and we're looking at ways that we can leverage an Ultimate Team mechanic and more games than we currently have in the non-sports style games."

We've spent the first part of this year taking the best from inside Electronic Arts as well as from outside, bringing in from the industry to build a world-class mobile team. And those 3 products really represent what we believe the future potential of big brands with natural, organic acquisition advantages, coupled with great quality, great technology and a focus on engagement that live services represents. So in the quarter, if you strip away the headwind from the premium download business, we're growing around 28%, but that growth actually accelerated as we stepped into December and we picked up share there with the releases of SimCity BuildIt. And as we look into '16 and beyond, our next product up is Need for Speed BuildIt, another huge brand that will acquire very well, built from the ground up, freemium service layer. We're really bullish on how this slate will unfold going forward and really drive that growth rate that's currently in the high 20s to something that we're pretty proud of."

The things you're able to do with vehicles, with weapons in the urban centers, it's just almost unbelievable. And you'll start to see more and more screen -- or more and more live gameplay of that over the next few weeks as we start to crank up the marketing activities. And then, obviously, the beta that Andrew mentioned. So more to come there, it's pretty exciting now. On the gross margin side, NHL was under $50 million in terms of revenues that was deferred into the quarter. And so that really probably took gross margins up by about 1 point relative to the overall -- over delivery of gross margin. And so it obviously helped, that's why we wanted to call it out. We did that because we had more to deliver on NHL than we did during the quarter and that's why we deferred some of the NHL revenue. I think, longer term, gross margin, more to come when we give guidance next year, but we do believe that we could operate in 30 -- or excuse me, 72% to 74% gross margin longer term. This year, we're in 70% to 71%, and in a couple of quarters, bouncing higher than that. But we do believe there's potential, particularly as we continue to ship that digital business in the live services moving forward. So more to come on that."

And obviously, now we're at $4.253 billion and $2.35. As I've said on the call, I think, the major drivers not flowing through all $150 million of the revenue fee was, first, we decided to move 2 titles out of the quarter, small titles, but titles nonetheless. PGA Golf and the first Sims expansion pack will both fall in the Q1 now. Those were originally in our thinking for Q4. Second, we don't know where FX was going to go. I don't think it's going to go down a lot more but I said that when the euro was $1.30. So there's some uncertainty there. And then, third, we're waiting to see when we'll be able to recognize our revenue on the FIFA Online 3 in China with our partner Tencent. There are some contractual obligations that need to be met. And we don't know if those will get met in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter. And so those uncertainties stopped us from flowing all $150 million through but what we did is flow through essentially the operating income benefit really flow through the entire EPS in the quarter."

Secondarily, yes, we've been talking for 2, 3 years now about increased systems and efficiencies that we're applying as a company towards the way that we communicate with our gamers. And you're seeing that, you're seeing that in every single quarter. We continue to ratchet down our expenses without revenues dropping and without our efficiency actually increasing in the way that we communicate directly with our gamers. We track metrics that are based on demand and intent to purchase, aided awareness, those continue to grow across all of our franchises. And our ability to track our consumers on a day-to-day basis rather than simply launch with big TV campaigns, which may have been what we've done many years ago, you're seeing the resulting efficiencies as the result of that marketing spend as a percentage in that revenue.

Dragon Age: Inquisition was named to more than 200 Game of the Year lists globally. More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week across the world. Madden NFL Mobile has its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching #4 on the top grossing chart in the U.S. Apple App Store, and we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console games publisher, a testament to the strength and breadth of EA's IP. Our excellent financial results reflect the strong player engagement and critical success of our titles. 
Revenue and earnings for Q3 were beyond our guidance, and we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. At the core, we continue to focus on putting players first. As we listen, learn and deliver for our communities with games and services that they love to play, we're experiencing new milestones in engagement. On console and PC platforms alone, more than 3.1 billion hours were spent playing EA games in Q3. Dragon Age: Inquisition captivated fans and critics worldwide as it launched in November, and it quickly became the most successful launch in BioWare history. More than 113 million hours have already been spent exploring the depth and detail of the single-player experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition, and more players are joining each day. Named Game of the Year by 32 media outlets around the world, including IGN, Gaming Format and the Associated Press, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a true masterpiece from the team at BioWare, and a game that is sure to be played for a long time to come. 
FIFA 15 and Madden NFL 15 also continued to deliver for fans in our third quarter. FIFA 15 was the #1 title in Europe and a top 10 title in the U.S. in 2014, with engagement growing in Q3. There were nearly 50% more users logging in each week as compared to Q3 last year. Meanwhile, Madden NFL 15 was the #2 best-selling title in North America for 2014 across whole genres and gameplay hours were up 30% year-on-year in Q3. 
In our Ultimate Team services, engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year. Our Maxis studio delivered 3 major game updates to The Sims 4 during Q3, providing fun new content and adding some of the most wanted community features. Each update has driven more players to engage with The Sims 4, and we have plans to continue delivering fresh content and gameplay to the vibrant Sims community. EA Mobile had a breakout performance over the holiday period. Our EA SPORTS titles are drawing more sports fans into mobile games, averaging more than 45 million monthly active users during the quarter. Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team led the way, averaging 45% more monthly players through Q3 compared to our previous iterations in the same period last year. 
The newly launched the SimCity BuildIt was downloaded more than 22 million time in the first month, reached the top 5 iOS game downloads in more than 100 countries and, to date, players have already logged more than 1.2 billion gameplay sessions. New games like Madden NFL Mobile, FIFA 15 Ultimate Team and SimCity BuildIt as well as perennial fan favorites like Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay and The Simpsons: Tapped Out, demonstrate one of our key opportunities in mobile, leveraging our IP and specifically designing experiences from the ground up for players on mobile devices. We are listening and learning from the feedback in our mobile community, tuning the experiences based on testing and soft launch periods then keeping players entertained with new content and challenges. Overall, the momentum that we're seeing across different platforms today gives us great reason to be excited for the future. 
On consoles, the installed base on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 continues to show strong growth. While new players joining on previous-generation consoles are also tapping into our amazing IP catalog. On mobile, innovative games are opening up new growth genres like sports, with highly engaged players. On PC, our Origin service continues to grow fiscal year-to-date and offer exciting new ways to play. Across all of these platforms, live services are extending the experience and bringing players deeper into the games they love. 
With the dynamic nature of this industry, platform preferences, player interests, play patterns and game experiences will constantly evolve. We are confident that through our efforts to put players first, to continue to digitally transform our business and to operate faster and more focused team, we will be in a position of strength to make these industry changes our greatest opportunity. 
I'll now hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at Q3 financial performance, then I'll return with a few final thoughts."
27963,281186370,749687,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior years, which included the launch of Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, stron",1417,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior years, which included the launch of Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, strong title performance and expense control drove operating margins up significantly this quarter to 36.3% from 33.8% last year. And this resulted in excellent cash generation and earnings. This extraordinary performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and Dragon Age: Inquisition. In particular, Dragon Age: Inquisition had, by far, the most successful launch in BioWare's history, exceeding our expectations. In addition, game sales for last-generation consoles were also much stronger than we had anticipated. FX negatively impacted revenue by about $20 million this quarter, but our hedging program offset about half of this and, combined with the natural hedging from our international operations, largely neutralized this impact on earnings. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 34% year-over-year to $693 million, 49% of this quarter's revenue and a new high. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was also a record, up 17% to $2.18 billion. This is the first time digital sales have generated more than half our revenue in a 12-month period. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $314 million, up 47% over the prior year, with Ultimate Team continuing its strong performance across our FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL franchises, up 82% year-over-year in total. FIFA Online 3 in Korea continues to grow year-over-year, and the early indications from our partner in China, Tencent, are that it is already performing extremely well. Star Wars: The Old Republic also contributed to the segment with the expansion, Shadow of Revan, attracting many more people into the game with its epic new storyline. Star Wars fans remain deeply engaged in The Old Republic universe and we're more excited to see how that will build as we get closer to the launch of the Star Wars movie this December. 
Mobile generated a record $139 million in the quarter, up 13% over the prior year. $125 million or 90% of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 28% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was just $14 million, down 44% compared to the prior year. Mobile had a strong December in particular, driven by the success of SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team mobile as well as the continued strength in the rest of our mobile portfolio. Leveraging proven IP like this reduces the cost of player acquisition and drives the long-term profitability of our mobile business. SimCity BuildIt has proven to be a highly engaging title that has been a top 10 grossing one on iPhone in 85 countries and on iPad in more than 100. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $140 million in revenue, up 22% over the prior year, driven by growth in the installed base of PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Although the percentage varied considerably by titles, platform and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues. Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $100 million, up 52% over the same period last year. The primary growth driver was Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access, our subscription service for Xbox One, continues to grow and we're seeing subscribers play more games, engaging more broadly with EA's offerings. 
Moving onto gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 72.8%, an increase from last year's 68.1% and better than our guidance of 70.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to the growth in our digital business, strength in current-generation consoles and a onetime benefit from NHL revenue deferred from the second quarter. This was partially offset by the higher proportion of sales from royalty-bearing titles in the quarter compared to last year's Q3. Out-performance versus our outlook was driven by the record-breaking Dragon Age: Inquisition performance. In addition, sell-through was extremely healthy across the market, enabling us to maintain margins above our expectations while keeping channel inventory clean. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter were $521 million, down 4% year-on-year, $19 million below prior year, but $6 million above our guidance. Compared to last year, we were able to continue to reduce advertising spend by focusing on fewer frontline titles and increasing the efficiency of the way we advertise. This was partially offset by an increase in the accruals we made from variable compensation and legal expenses, which were not in our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.22 per share, $0.32 better than guidance due to strong revenue, higher gross margin and continued cost control. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.94 billion or approximately $9.48 per share. 66 of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $682 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $1.15 billion, a record for this period. 
During Q3, we repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $97 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May 2014, and has a 2-year time frame. The current rate of purchase keeps us on track to complete the full $750 million in that time. 
Turning to guidance. We're increasing our full year guidance. For fiscal year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $78 million to $4.253 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will be increased by $0.30 to $2.35 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of nearly 24%. Although this guidance passes through essentially all of the Q3 earnings outperformance for the full year, it does not pass through all the revenue. The reduction in our Q4 revenue expectation is based on uncertainty around future currency movements and the decision to move EA SPORTS' PGA TOUR and the first Sims 4 expansion pack into fiscal '16. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when we will start to recognize revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China. However, gross margin improvement and continued expense control offset this conservatism in revenue, allowing us to substantially reaffirm our Q4 earnings expectation. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.485 billion in revenue and $2.57 in fully diluted EPS. 
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.05 billion, which would be the largest fiscal year cash flow in the company's history. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $950 million. Guidance for our fourth quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $830 million, a 9% decrease compared to last year's $914 million. The year-on-year difference is largely driven by Battlefield 4 catalog sales, which were very strong in Q4 fiscal '14, the quarter immediately after we shipped Battlefield. 
Our next major launch title, Battlefield Hardline, will start to ship the 3rd week of March, so its impact on the quarter will be limited, even though we expect it to build into a significant title through next fiscal year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 74%. We expect our Q4 operating expenses to be $515 million on a non-GAAP basis. This results in non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.22 per share as compared to $0.48 last year. Our Q4 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.16 billion as compared to $1.12 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.07 as compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year. We're pleased with our third quarter results, and most importantly, with the consistent growth of cash flow and earnings. We're well ahead of where we expected to be at this stage of our transformation, largely as a result of the strength of our digital live services strategy, our ability to control costs and the continued great commitment of our employees to drive performance. But there's plenty more opportunities ahead of us. We expect these factors will continue to drive growth in cash flow and earnings and to be augmented by a growing mobile business as we continue to apply our core IP to this platform. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

It was a great Q3 and there's more to be excited about as we look to Q4 and beyond. The launch of Battlefield Hardline will be the culmination of efforts by the team at Visceral and across EA to engage our players and deliver a rich and innovative new experience. Battlefield Hardline is a fresh combination of speed, story and strategy, a mix of an engaging single player campaign inspired by popular TV dramas, new speed-based multiplayer experiences and classic Battlefield multiplayer modes. We're getting great response to the game in recent play tests and we look forward to opening it up to the community with the upcoming multiplayer beta. This is a fast, fun and intense new experience and we think players are going to love it. We look forward to launching this new take on Battlefield beginning on March 17. 
Our slate for the coming year demonstrates EA's commitment to exciting players through brand-new experiences as well as our live services. Players in our current experiences including Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Sims 4, the EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield 4, will continue to see updates and new content in the future. We will now launch PGA TOUR in Q1 FY '16, in line with some of golf's biggest tournaments and it will be joined by a lineup of annual EA SPORTS titles next year. Our Need for Speed franchise will return in FY '16, with a game that is already looking spectacular. And of course, the new blockbuster Star Wars Battlefront is set to release in the holiday quarter this year. 
We'll share our full FY '16 calendar, including a slate of new mobile games during our next quarterly call. 
I said earlier in the call that the very nature of the games industry is that it is dynamic and constantly evolving. This plays to the strength of Electronic Arts. Change is one of the constants in the history of this company, and we continue to change ourselves to listen, learn and lead an exciting new future for gaming and for our players. You'll see us focus on our player relationships to engage and understand what inspires each gamer to play. You'll see us investing in new IP and innovation from ground-up new experiences to cutting edge digital services. And you'll see us focus on quality at every turn. Stability in our services and delivery of long-lasting fun with games that are played for months and years, not just days or weeks. 
Throughout FY '15, EA has focused on putting our players first and strengthening the foundation of our business. We now look forward to a strong finish in Q4 and carrying momentum from FY '15 into FY '16.

One phenomenon that we do see in the Christmas holiday was that people like to give physical gifts that sit under the tree or wherever you do your gift-giving. And so oftentimes, we don't see the pickup in full game downloads until after people have played their first round of games they've gotten for Christmas presents. And Peter's point was we've seen this most recent pickup in the last couple of weeks of full game downloads, which would tie back to the notion that people are now starting to really understand the power of their new consoles and starting to pick that up."

And in addition, we actually get a natural hedge based on the fact that we have substantial number of employees and offices in Europe as well as in Canada. And we tend to focus on 4 core currencies, the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Swedish kroner, which are really the 4 core centers of where we have employees as well as where our core revenue exist. We're exposed to other currencies beyond that because they're not as large in the overall mix. The reality is that we're able to hedge our revenue but rarely can we hedge 100% of that. We're able to hedge, partially because of actual hedges and partially because of natural hedges, more of our operating income swing. So we'll tend to see a larger swing on the top line than we do on the bottom line. This quarter, we saw virtually no impact on the bottom line, and as I said, about a $20 million impact on the top line. The real unknown for us going forward is exactly what we think operating -- or the euro is going to look like 6 to 9 months out where our hedges are less impactful going forward. We'll know more when we give guidance in May for the full year. We see a little risk in the fourth quarter if you see continued decline in the euro. But I think, the big unknown for us is what does the euro look like all through our next fiscal year, and does that present a risk and we'll give you an update and we're doing our best to try to hedge out as much of that risk as possible."

In addition to that, we're seeing continued engagement with our live services and players playing longer and engaging deeper with those live services across both generations of console. And as we've talked about, we had a very strong quarter with respect to mobile, and we're starting to see the value of our IP combined with the learning experiences that we've had over the past couple of years with respect to mobile.

And that's allowed us to move into what looks like now roughly 24% operating margin for the year with, obviously, this quarter showing operating margins well into the mid-30s. We do believe that we've got potential continued upside on the gross margin side of the business as we push our digital business.

Why don't I start and then I can toss it to Frank. The one reminder is growth -- underlying growth in mobile is really 28% if you pull that premium business out, which is a legacy for us, it's down to about $14 million a year and declining year-over-year. We can't force it out any faster than we're already doing because it's embedded in a lot of the way people play games still. But Frank can talk about the exciting growth idea that -- as well as growth that we're seeing in the mobile business. First, just on the Ultimate Team side of the equation, the key for us in Ultimate Team right now has been discovery, making sure people understand what it is and how exciting and fun it is. Still a smaller portion than -- of all the people that buy the game, less than half the people actually enter into Ultimate Team and a small fraction of those people actually get heavily involved in Ultimate Team and ultimately monetize. And so part of our goal is increasing visibility of Ultimate Team and making sure that people understand how to play it and how fun it is. So you see, when you load up the Madden disc for the first time, you see Ultimate Team come up on your screen. We're trying to make sure people understand, get into the funnel essentially and understand how passionate and powerful it is as you start to play it. And we're trying to encourage people to play with their friends and so you'll see more and more of that drive Ultimate Team. Clearly, it's of a scale today that you question how much larger can it get, but we're surprised every quarter about the continued growth in it, and we do know particularly how much people love and particularly how much opportunity there could still be going forward. So exciting times ahead and we're looking at ways that we can leverage an Ultimate Team mechanic in more games than we currently have, even non-sports style games."

And as we look into '16 and beyond, our next product up is Need for Speed BuildIt, another huge brand that will acquire very well, with a built-from-the-ground-up freemium service layer.

And I think that's going to really catch people by surprise. And you're going to see a lot of people -- the momentum is going to build on it as more and more people start to play at and want their friends to be able to come in and play it. The things you're able to do with vehicles, with weapons in the urban centers, it's just almost unbelievable. And you'll start to see more and more screen -- or more and more live gameplay of that over the next few weeks as we start to crank up the marketing activities. And then, obviously, the beta that Andrew mentioned. So more to come there, it's pretty exciting, though. On the gross margin side, NHL was under $50 million in terms of revenue that was deferred into the quarter. And so that really probably took gross margins up by about 1 point relative to the overall -- over delivery of gross margin. And so it's obviously helped, that's why we wanted to call it out. We did that because we had more to deliver on NHL than we did during the quarter and that's why we deferred some of the NHL revenue. I think, longer-term gross margin, more to come when we give guidance next year, but we do believe that we could operate in 30 -- or excuse me, 72% to 74% gross margins longer term. This year, we're in that 70% to 71%, and in a couple of quarters, bouncing higher than that. But we do believe there's potential, particularly as we continue to ship that digital business and the live services moving forward. So more to come on that."

As Frank mentioned, there's Need for Speed coming on mobile, but also we're going to have another couple of unannounced, very exciting mobile titles as well in the quarter -- or in the year. And then, last but far from least, we've got the Battlefront Star Wars title coming in before Christmas next year, aligned with the Star Wars movie rollout. We're extremely excited about that and we think there's huge potential for that title. More to come in the next couple of months on that as more about the movie comes out as well as more about our title comes out. But you should consider that a very large activity for us next year and a very large focus, similar to how we thought about Battlefield in the past."

We're remaking some of the headcount, so we're moving towards more live services. That means more customer service, more live service management. And that will have to be offset by reductions in other places where we can balance that headcount mix, or remix the headcount amongst what people do in their day-to-day jobs."

And we're actively looking at how we could offer that type of experience to our players, console and across other platforms. From there, it really comes down to do they make their next step in terms of a premium download, a micro-transaction in a free-to-play type environment, or a broader relationship through a subscription. And our expectation is that we will be offering all 3 of those options to players, both on console and across other platforms."

We don't try to place bets to try to make money on hedges. We simply are trying to offset swings that could occur. So ideally, for us, it would be we're constantly neutral to any currency moves. Now obviously, that's hard to do and it gets expensive. And so when you see rapid changes in FX like we've seen in the last 6 weeks, it's harder to be able to protect against that over a long-term period of time, it just gets very expensive to do. So we're constantly -- we have rolling hedges that we add over time to smooth our hedging and we try to make sure that we're protecting both the revenue line, but most importantly, the cash flow and the earnings line."

It's -- having been on that side of the business as you well remember, it's a strong opportunity for both of these to continue to leverage the power of that very large installed base. There's a great portfolio of titles that stretches back 9 years. The hardware is great value for money for consumers that haven't jumped in yet for a console hardware. We were concerned, you may recall probably 2 or 3 quarters ago, that all of the action was in Xbox Ones and PS4s. But I think, what's happened is that, that consumer's moved on there's plenty of consumers that are still looking to get involved in games. Great deals for retailers around the world in Q3 and the holiday period. And our job, obviously, is to be able to take full advantage of that, and nobody in the industry has more recognizable blockbusters than Electronic Arts. And I think, it's as simple as that. Our teams are well positioned with our content, with our -- both our retail partners as well as full game downloads of those titles. And this is where great brands and great IP shines with consumers that maybe come in a little late and are looking for recognizable content. So I think, you can characterize it as a stable situation.

We do, as we're thinking about our cash needs, obviously, first we think about just the general operating needs and we always are weighing on the notion that now 60% of that cash is sitting onshore, but that's a benefit from the repatriation that we did 1.5 years ago or 1 year ago. There's a natural cash build that occurs internationally and so that will start to deplete over time and we'll go back to probably a greater cash balance internationally than domestically. Also weighing on our thinking is the current converts that are due in August of next year, August calendar year '15 -- or '16, excuse me, and we're thinking through ways in which we either can refinance those or pay those off, but that clearly weighs on how much cash we hold, at least in the interim. And then, last but not least, we're very committed to continuing to buy back stock. We're on track to be able to complete the $750 million 2-year buyback. And as we generate more cash, we'll consider greater buybacks over time. It's not complicated. I think, we just have a simple model, which is saying, how do we get that back to shareholders."

And obviously, now we're at $4.253 billion and $2.35. As I've said on the call, I think, the major driver of not flowing through all $150 million of the revenue beat was, first, we decided to move 2 titles out of the quarter, small titles, but titles nonetheless. PGA Golf and the first Sims expansion pack will both fall into Q1 now. Those were originally in our thinking for Q4. Second, we don't know where FX is going to go. I don't think it's going to go down a lot more but I said that when the euro was at $1.30. So there's some uncertainty there. And then, third, we're waiting to see when we'll be able to recognize our revenue on the FIFA Online 3 in China with our partner Tencent. There are some contractual obligations that need to be met. And we don't know if those will get met in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter. And so those uncertainties stopped us from flowing all $150 million through, but what we did is flow through, essentially, the operating income benefit to really flow through the entire EPS in the quarter."

Our",1319,"Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. FY '15 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts, with a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global bestsellers and breakout hits. Our large services for franchises like Battlefield, FIFA, Madden NFL and The Sims are thriving. The communities in our mobile title continue to grow and through constant dialogue, we are forging deeper relationships with our players. We've broaden our portfolio on key platforms, introduce new service models and delivered quality through stable, scalable and individual experiences. All of this contributed to outstanding player engagement in EA experiences across console, PC and mobile in FY '15. Our financial results were consistently strong throughout the year. Revenue and EPS were above our guidance for the full fiscal year and we have reached an all-time high in operating cash flow. EA today is performing with focus and efficiency and we're leaning into our strength to deliver great experience into a growing and diverse audience of players around the world. 
Dragon Age: Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline are both terrific examples of the focus we have today. Moving launch date is never easy but we are committed to making the hard decision that will benefit our players. With Dragon Age: Inquisition, both extra few weeks of polish allowed BioWare to deliver  a truly epic new experience. Not only did it win dozens of game of the year awards, more importantly, our players gave it the highest form of praise, with nearly 200 million hours of Dragon Age: Inquisition played as of to-date. Additional team open up to player feedback earlier and more than ever before while developing Battlefield Hardline and the input from our community was a catalyst of great innovation. With the added development on, Battlefield Hardline delivered a complete package for different types of play, strategy based, battle field game play that our fans love, fast and fun new multiplayer mode like Hotwire, as well as a deep story driven single player campaign. We're very happy with how well the game has sold to-date and more importantly, that we brought many new fans into the Battlefield universe. 
Meanwhile, EA Sports had one of its best performance ever. Nearly 6 months after launch FIFA '15 remains a top 5 title in the Western world with more than 80 million matches on average every day in Q4. Game play hours of Madden NFL '15 were up nearly 30% for the quarter over last year and the hours played in Madden NFL Ultimate Team in the quarter increase a massive 97% year-over-year. Passionate sports fans are spending more time in our games today and engaging in our ultimate team mode which is extends the fun long after the season is over. We continue to see major growth in player engagement with our live services and offerings across all platforms. Our investment in Battlefield 4 brought great stability to the experience and allowed us to acquire a learning to ensure that Battlefield Hardline was stable and scalable at launch and beyond. We now have 2 Battlefield experiences with large highly engaged audiences and both received good expansion pack in the coming months. Other services are showing strong momentum with players, as well. Monthly engagement levels on Origin are up significantly over the previous year and the subscriber base that EA access continues to grow as we learn more about the innovative new delivery model on [indiscernible]. For players on smartphones and tablets, we built a strong foundation of key titles and now, we're adding to it. Players are going deeper into SimCity Builder logging more than 2.4 billion game sessions in Q4, and Madden NFL Mobile continues to capture more sports gamers with game play up 25% over the previous quarter. But perhaps the greatest example of our core strength in mobile is on the experiences that will provide use of entertainment is The Simpsons: Tapped Out. Nearly 3 years after launched, The Simpsons: Tapped Out average more than 16 million monthly players throughout FY '15. We are building some extra momentum in our mobile business and we're excited to launch new Minions and Star Wars experience later this year. 
In FY '15, we captured hundreds of millions of players with new RPG, sports, shooter, simulation and casual experiences across console, PC and mobile devices. Now, as we look ahead at the opportunities ahead of our as in FY '16 we are position to build relationships with millions more to entirely new experiences, as well as new games in our major franchises. Just 3 weeks ago, the world got its latest look at Star Wars Battlefront from Studio. The reaction has been powerful. Our Star Wars Battlefront trailer has been watched more than 29 million times to date across social platforms. Brought to life through an unprecedented partnership with Disney and Lucas Films, Star Wars Battlefront will immerse players  into the Star Wars universe like never before. The power of our thrust bite engine technology enabled us to deliver intricately detailed visuals and a completely offsetting environment for players to live out their Star Wars fantasy. Anticipation is now building for the launch of Star Wars Battlefront in November and we're excited to be part of one of the biggest global culture evidence of the year with the return of Star Wars. We look forward to showing more of Star Wars Battlefront in just a few weeks. 
In addition to Star Wars Battlefront, we will leverage the breath of our IP to reach a wider audience of players across multiple genres and platforms in FY '16. EA Sports will excite fans throughout the summer and fall with the latest releases of Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL and NBA Live, including industry-leading gameplay, compelling new features and fresh ultimate experiences. FY '16 will see the return of Need For Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well a new mobile game. Maxes will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game pack and additional game update for the growing Sims 4 community. After Plants vs. Zombies Garden Wars became a sensation last year with console players young and old,we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience in FY '16 that will share more [indiscernible]. Minions Paradise, our first game with a popular franchise in partnership with Illumination Entertainment will be one of at least 5 new EA mobile titles this year. In spring 2016, [indiscernible] is set to revolutionized the action/adventure genre with its stunning first person gameplay. And of course, we'll continue to bring new content to our communities in Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield Fall, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Star Wars: The Old Republic, our EA Sports title and EA mobile games. Our large services will continue to give these experiences fresh and fun for players throughout the year. Across the world today, more people are playing games and spending more time playing games than ever before. The audience is wider and more diverse than we have ever known. Games are truly becoming the best form of entertainment and EA is well-positioned to benefit. Building relationships with new players and strengthening existing ones through meaningful engagement is at the core of our objective as a company.  We continue to invest in our digital platform, infrastructure, security, large service systems and community engagements to scale of the needs of the growing global player base that holds games as a vital and intrinsic part of their lives. FY '15 will commence as formative year for EA as we put our players first, delivering high potential services and drove great speed in the business. I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q4 financial performance and a view into the year ahead."

When we first started talking about improvi",2638,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested that it would take 3 years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in 2 years. In fact, at nearly 25% our fiscal '15 operating margin is over 500 basis above our guidance at the beginning of the year and its highest point in over a decade.  We've dramatically increase our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down full 10 percentage points from 56% of net revenue in fiscal '13 to just 46% in fiscal '15 and we've done so without adversely impacting our revenue or the effectiveness of our R&D or marketing. This year, we delivered the best Dragon Age of all-time, grew our sports franchises, expanded the core franchises Battlefield Hardline and announced new IP including Star Wars Battlefront. In addition, we continue to grow our digital live services and leverage our IT portfolio to establish a strong position on mobile platforms. Our core product catalog and digital live services are helping the company deliver more consistent, repeatable revenue and cash flow each year. These improvements have more than quadruple our free cash flow over the same period from 2000 -- $218 million in fiscal '13 and $972 million in fiscal '15 and driven a three-fold increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS from $0.84 a share to $2.51 a share. But there's plenty of road left to traveled on our journey to build both great games and shareholder value, most significantly, the digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still in its infancy. This transformation presents the opportunity to continue to grow margin by increasing the proportion of full game downloads by providing extra content for games and by taking our IP to mobile platforms. Downloads of our games for our current generation consoles continue to increase. Meanwhile, our extra content and subscription strategy generated $1.3 billion in net revenue in fiscal '15 and continues to grow strongly. Finally, our mobile business at $524 million is now the third-largest in Western markets and the 8th largest worldwide and we anticipate continued healthy growth going forward. As well as driving gross margin improvement we continue to look for opportunities to better leverage our investments. For example, our digital platform strategy will help us better understand engage with gamers for more efficiently and standardized across studios across our titles and accelerate our innovation. Bottom line, we believe we can continue to grow non-GAAP EPS into the future. 
Moving to the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP revenue was $896 million, which was $66 million above our guidance and $18 million below last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by sales of Battlefield Hardline and the ongoing strength of our catalog titles. In addition, our mobile business continue to grow led by Sim City Builder, Madden NFL Mobile, The Sims Free Play and The Simpsons: Tapped Out. One note, because FIFA Online 3 was launched in China in April, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4. We expect to start recognizing revenue for this service in Q1 fiscal '16. EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $602 million. This resulted in a fiscal year digital revenue of more than $2.2 billion, about 52% of total revenue. Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $247 million, up 2% over the prior year. The growth of extra content slowed this quarter due to FX headwinds resulting from the fact that most of the FIFA Ultimate Team business is in Europe and from changes we made to reduce illegitimate coin selling in FIFA Ultimate Team. Nevertheless, for the year, FIFA Ultimate Team expanded over 40% and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. Overall, Ultimate Team grew 53% on top of the prior year's 62% growth. We took staff during the quarter to reduce the trading of illegitimate FIFA Ultimate Team coins which had distorted the economy and made it difficult for many players build the team they wanted. We've made changes on game exploits and automated processes they used to generate those coins and taken steps to rebalance the game economy. However, some risks remain and we factor those into our Q1 and full year guidance. 
Second, our mobile business generated $150 million for the quarter, up 22% over prior year. Premium mobile only accounted for $9 million of the local revenue this quarter. Excluding premium, our ongoing mobile business grew 38% year-on-year. Third, download added $114 million to the quarter, flat year-on-year with strong sales of Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Sims 4, offsetting the falloff in Battlefield 4 and [indiscernible] sales. Our origin service from PC gamers have increase its monthly player engagement levels by 2/3 over the previous year and continues the strong program in end users. And finally, subscription, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $91 million, up $22 million or 32% over the same period last year, driven largely by Battlefield 4 premium. EA Access again outperformed and we expect its contribution to accelerate this year as we start to promote the service with Microsoft and continue to add titles to the EA access vault.  
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 75.4%, 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline. It was down from 77.4% in Q4 of fiscal '14, primarily due to the strength of our sports titles. Operating expenses for the quarter were $513 million, up $10 million from last year and $2 million lower than our guidance. The year-on-year increase is primarily due to marketing expenses for Battlefield Hardline. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 per share, 17% above our guidance. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $198 million compared to $281 million in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of titles. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year gained its highest level in company history at $1.07 billion, a very significant increase over last year's cash flow of $712 million and above our twice revised guidance. Fiscal year '15 capital expenditure were $95 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $972 million. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.02 billion or $9.75 per share. Approximately 62% of this was held in the U.S. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.44 per share. 
We far surpassed our expectations for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, we exceeded our original revenue guidance by $219 million, gross margin by 250 basis points, operating cash flow by $267 million and EPS by $0.66 a share. The new EA is delivering more consistent revenue, increasing the proportion of high margin digital revenue and growing operating margins, earnings and cash flow. This has given the Board confidence to authorize a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program has a 2 year time frame and replaces the remaining $356 million portion of our previous $750 million buyback program. It represents an expected return to shareholders of approximately 50% of forecasted free cash flow. 
Onto fiscal 2016 guidance. With regards to the market, we  expect the console transition to continue at a rapid pace and another 22 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 27 million units in place at the end of calendar 2014. This is a much faster growth than in previous generation, illustrating how far the transition has already come, approximately 4 out of every 5 copies of Battlefield Hardline sold for consoles that were either Xbox One or PlayStation 4. In addition to the console growth, we are expecting our mobile franchise to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android. We're anticipating the installed base to grow by  over $600 million to nearly 3 billion devices by the end of calendar 2015. On a constant currency basis, we expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 8% to $4.65 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based and driven by the launch of Star Wars Battlefront, the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, the expansion of our mobile business and the addition of Need for Speed, Mirrors Edge and Plants vs. Zombies titles, as well as some other unannounced games. We expect foreign exchange rates will have an impact on our forecasted results. At our FY '16 guided exchange rates, we anticipated FX headwind of approximately $250 million, leading to our expectation for non-GAAP revenue of $4.4 billion. Volatility and exchange rates during the year may cause us to reconsider these assumptions and we'll update you on a quarterly basis. Non-GAAP gross margins is expected to rise about 50 basis points to 71.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue. This forecast reflects gross margin pressure for product mix, since one of our major launches this year is Star Wars Battlefront, a royalty bearing title. As a reminder, the major non-sports titles last year were Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Sims 4, all of which are wholly owned IP. Although the dollars rise had a negative impact on revenue, it had a positive impact on expense, since about 46% of our R&D expenses is outside the U.S. This natural hedge is worth approximately $100 million in FY '16 and offset the increased investment for planning for new IP at our digital platform. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.98 billion, marginally down compared to fiscal '15. This will deliver an operating margin of approximately 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75, up 10% year-on-year. This includes an average impact of $0.21 from FX and the benefit of $0.11 due to a change in tax rate. The strong growth of our business outside of the United States is having a long-term benefit to our corporate tax rate, such that we narrow view our long-term non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%, instead of 25%. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance does not factor in any share repurchases that may take place during the year. The earnings presentation on our Investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year. On a GAAP basis, guidances for net revenue of $4.25 billion, gross margin of 69.4% and EPS of $1.90. Segmenting the sales provides further insight into our key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. As a note, all of these revenue numbers assumed guidance exchange rates. Packaged goods and other revenues is forecasted to be approximately $1.85 billion, down 11%, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery. Digital revenue is forecasted to be nearly $2.55 billion, up 14%. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group. Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 25% as we broaden our revenue base through the launch of more free to download games based on our own IP, such as Need for Speed and licensed IT such as Star Wars and Minions, while continue to generate income from existing titles. In addition, the headwind remaining for the winding down of our premium mobile business is now very small. Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow in line with last year's growth. Full game downloads on current generation consoles are now over 20% for a newly launched game and we're seeing higher percentages for our catalog titles. As a reminder, we count bundled games as physical sales, regardless of whether it is a disk or downloaded code in a box with the console. We've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010 and we believe the same forces that drove this on PC are playing the latest generation of consoles. Extra content and free to downloads is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by FIFA Online Tree and Ultimate Team. Our strongest markets for Ultimate Team are overseas, so this forecast is based on a significant effort FX headwind, as well as the changes we made to improve the FIFA Ultimate Team experience. Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to decline approximately 15% to 20% this year, driven by a falloff in Battlefield 4 premium revenue, partially offset by the growth in EA Assets and then by Battlefield Hardline premium revenue. GAAP operating expenses for the fiscal year are expected to be around $2.17 billion. 
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2016, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion in capital expenses to be approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.05 billion, versus $972 million in fiscal 2014. Focusing on Q1, our Q1 is seasonally the quietest of our fiscal year and although we have no major launches this quarter, we do anticipate strong catalog sales, particularly of FIFA '15 and Battlefield Hardline, which launched at the very end of Q4. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.14 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.14 as compared to $1.04 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, a 17% decreased compared to last year's $775 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rate, Titanfall, the launch of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UFC and from Battlefield 4 catalog. The decline is offset by Battlefield Hardline catalog but we are not planning any HD launches this quarter. Our revenue facing for FY '16 is different to the prior year with a much larger proportion in the back half due to our launch schedule. The expected savings of our revenues is in the earnings presentation posted to our website. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, $16 million higher compared to last year, driven by the extra week in the quarter, offset somewhat by more favorable exchange rates for overseas expenses. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $0.00 per share as compared to $0.19 per share last year. Looking further into the future, we remain focused on driving our business model and improving profitability. We will continue to leverage one of the core strengths of our business, the reoccurring revenue generated by our annualized titles, live services and ongoing mobile businesses. While not guarantee, this revenue is highly dependable and accounts for 60% to 70% of our total revenue. For the next few years, we expect further improvements in gross margin on the order of 100 basis points a year through growing our digital business. In addition, we will continue to invest in new and existing IP and a new technology infrastructure to support our growing live services business. In marketing, we will continue to increase personalization and customization and leverage our player network to further improve efficiency and impact. These efforts will help us move operating margins from the mid-20s to the high 20s and continue to grow our earnings and cash flow balance. 
In conclusion, fiscal '15, we made some considerable progress on our journey. We were able to massively grow earnings and cash generation and we have built a solid and consistent business with a strong operational foundation that enables us to capitalize on the shift to digital content, the console cycle and the growth of mobile. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

For us, we're thinking about it with kind of 2 bookends, right? 1 book end is the historical battlefront which is roughly 9 million units. The other book end is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance we can roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title which we believe some upsides obviously if things go well. It is Gen 4 only in PC and so that needs to get factored into people's thinking but it is very exciting title. It will put, as we said in the script some pressure on the gross margin in the quarter. We've been trying to target 100 basis points of gross margin improvement and this year we're forecasting roughly 50 basis points. And much of that is due to the fact that there's a loyalty on that to Disney and at a level of 10 million units, that's a fairly large pressure on gross. So that's -- we're very optimistic and excited about this title and obviously, the markets been the same way.

And secondarily, how much data are you collecting from all of your users, just broadly and where do you think you are in terms of using that data to influence your content development?"

A lot of work to go there in order to deliver the kind of experiences we believe our players want to play but certainly we have going on. As it relates to data collection, we are collecting, I heard, 1 stat we collect more data on a daily basis than the combined U.S. Library of Congress, which as you can imagine is a lot of data. At a more core level, what we're trying to understand better than our players is how engagement works, how engagement works were playing engagement with them on more than 1 platform, how engagement works where a player plays more than 1 franchise and the effective engagement over the long-term as it relates to the likelihood that a player will continue and buy the next version of a title provided we can keep them playing overtime. So there's a lot in our data right now as it relates to our players. We are using that data 1, to build better games and 2, to deliver more enhanced and extended and engaging experience over time to keep them playing and entertained for longer."

Tencent has been very public around their optimism. But we remind people it's taken us 3 to 4 years to grow Korea's awareness today and Korea is a more fluent market than China right now. So it's probably going to take some time. Also software is much more prevalent in Korea than it is in China but it's growing faster in China. So we hope to follow that.

And the first is we have the broadest and more diverse and powerful portfolio of brands in the business and that translates into very strong organic acquisition advantages. So pound for pound, people have heard of Sim City, The Sims, products like FIFA, Madden and organically they install it at very high rates. If you look at how SimCity did over the break. We were generating tens of millions of installs without really spending any money in paid acquisition. That's also combined with a really powerful network that we're designing. So it allows us to cross promote and understand based on telemetry and data, what our gamers doing at any given time and what's the right message at the right time and what are the right games that we put in front of them that might interest them. So the combination of a profound organic acquisition power coming from brand power and a network effect, we believe will allow us to from a long-term standpoint, keep marketing and sales at a percentage of revenue very low. Very low certainly relative to other mobile game companies. And as we look to grow the business, we'll continue to harness those advantages."

FY '15 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts. With a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global bestsellers and breakout hits. Our",1327,"Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. FY '15 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts. With a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global bestsellers and breakout hits. Our live services for franchises like Battlefield, FIFA, Madden NFL and The Sims are thriving. The communities in our mobile titles continue to grow. And through constant dialogue, we are forging deeper relationships with our players. We broadened our portfolio on key platforms, introduced new service models and delivered quality through stable, scalable and innovative experiences. All of this contributed to outstanding player engagement in EA experiences across console, PC and mobile in FY '15.
Our financial results were consistently strong throughout the year. Revenue and EPS were above our guidance for the full fiscal year, and we have reached an all-time high in operating cash flow. EA today is performing with focus and efficiency, and we're leaning into our strength to deliver great experiences to a growing and diverse audience of players around the world.
Dragon Age: Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline are both terrific examples of the focus we have today. Moving launch dates is never easy, but we are committed to making the hard decisions that will benefit our players. With Dragon Age: Inquisition, those extra few weeks of polish allowed BioWare to deliver a truly epic new experience. Not only did it win dozens of Game of the Year awards. More importantly, our players gave it the highest form of praise, with nearly 200 million hours of Dragon Age: Inquisition played life to date. 
Our Visceral team opened up to player feedback earlier and more than ever before while developing Battlefield Hardline, and the input from our community was a catalyst for great innovation. With the added development time, Battlefield Hardline delivered a complete package for different types of play, core strategy-based Battlefield gameplay that our fans love, fast and fun new multiplayer mode like Hotwire as well as a deep story-driven single-player campaign. We're very happy with how well the game has sold to date and, more importantly, that we brought many new fans into the Battlefield universe.
Meanwhile, EA SPORTS had one of its best performance ever. Nearly 6 months after launch, FIFA 15 remains a top 5 title in the Western world, with more than 18 million matches played on average every day in Q4. Gameplay hours of Madden NFL 15 were up nearly 30% for the quarter over last year and the hours played in Madden NFL Ultimate Team in the quarter increased a massive 97% year-over-year. Passionate sports fans are spending more time in our games today and engaging in our Ultimate Team modes to extend the fun long after the season is over. We continue to see major growth in player engagement with our live services and digital offerings across all platforms. Our investments in Battlefield 4 brought greater stability to the experience and allowed us to apply our learning to ensure that Battlefield Hardline was stable and scalable at launch and beyond. We now have 2 Battlefield experiences with large highly engaged audiences, and both will receive new expansion pack in the coming months.
Other services are showing strong momentum with players as well. Monthly engagement levels on Origin were up significantly over the previous year, and the subscriber base for EA Access continues to grow as we learn more about the innovative new delivery model on console.
For players on smartphones and tablets, we've built a strong foundation of key titles, and now we're adding to it. Players are going deeper into SimCity BuildIt, logging more than 2.4 billion game sessions in Q4. And Madden NFL Mobile continues to capture more sports gamers, with gameplay up 25% [ph] over the previous quarter. But perhaps the greatest example of our core strength in mobile, designing experiences that will provide years of entertainment, is The Simpsons: Tapped Out. Nearly 3 years after launch, The Simpsons: Tapped Out averaged more than 16 million monthly players throughout FY '15. We are building some excellent momentum in our mobile business, and we're excited to launch new Minions and Star Wars experiences later this year. 
In FY '15, we captured hundreds of millions of players with new RPG, sports, shooter, simulation and casual experiences across console, PC and mobile devices. Now as we look at the opportunities ahead of us in FY '16, we are positioned to build relationships with millions more through entirely new experiences as well as new games in our major franchises.
Just 3 weeks ago, the world got its latest look at Star Wars Battlefront from our DICE Studio. The reaction has been powerful. Our Star Wars Battlefront trailer has been watched more than 29 million times to date across social platforms. Brought to life through an unprecedented partnership with Disney and Lucasfilms, Star Wars Battlefront will immerse players  into the Star Wars universe like never before. The power of our Frostbite engine technology enabled us to deliver intricately detailed visuals and a completely authentic environment for players to live out their Star Wars fantasies. Anticipation is now building for the launch of Star Wars Battlefront in November, and we're excited to be part of one of the biggest global culture events of the year with the return of Star Wars. We look forward to showing more of Star Wars Battlefront to players at E3 in just a few weeks.
In addition to Star Wars Battlefront, we will leverage the breadth of our IP to reach a wider audience of players across multiple genres and platforms in FY '16. EA SPORTS will excite fans throughout the summer and fall with the latest releases of Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL and NBA Live, including industry-leading gameplay, compelling new features and fresh Ultimate team experiences.
FY '16 will see the return of Need For Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well a new mobile game. 
Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game pack and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 community.
After Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare became a sensation last year with console players young and old, we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience in FY '16 that we'll share more about at E3.
Minions Paradise, our first game with the popular franchise in partnership with Illumination Entertainment will be one of at least 5 new EA Mobile titles this year.
In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its  stunning first-person gameplay.
And of course, we'll continue to bring new content to our communities in Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield 4, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Star Wars: The Old Republic, our EA SPORTS titles and EA Mobile games. Our live services will continue to keep these experiences fresh and fun for players throughout the year.
Across the world today, more people are playing games and spending more time playing games than ever before. The audience is wider and more diverse than we have ever known. Games are truly becoming the best form of entertainment, and EA is well positioned to benefit. Building relationships with new players and strengthening existing ones through meaningful engagement is at the core of our objectives as a company.  We are continuing to invest in our digital platform, infrastructure, security, live service systems and community engagements teams to scale the needs of a growing global player base that hold games as a vital and intrinsic part of their lives.
FY '15 was a transformative year for EA as we put our players first, delivered amazing high-quality games and services and drove greater speed and efficiency into our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q4 financial performance and a view into the year ahead."
27963,291348854,804648,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into the details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. When we first started talking about imp",2661,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into the details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take 3 years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in 2 years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal '15 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. 
We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points from 56% of net revenue in fiscal '13 to just 46% in fiscal '15. And we've done so without adversely impacting our revenue or the effectiveness of our R&D or marketing. This year, we delivered the best Dragon Age of all time, grew our sports franchises, expanded a core franchise with Battlefield Hardline and announced new IP including Star Wars Battlefront. In addition, we continue to grow our digital live services and leveraged our IP portfolio to establish a strong position on mobile platforms. Our core product catalog and digital live services are helping the company deliver more consistent, repeatable revenue and cash flow each year.
These improvements have more than quadrupled our free cash flow over the same period from 2000 or 2 points -- or  $218 million in fiscal '13 to $972 million in fiscal '15 and driven a threefold increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS from $0.84 a share to $2.51 a share. But there's plenty of road left to traveled on our journey to build both great games and shareholder value. Most significantly, the digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still at its infancy. This transformation presents opportunity to continue to grow margins by increasing the proportion of full game downloads, by providing extra content for games and by taking our IP to mobile platforms. Downloads of our games for current-generation consoles continue to increase. Meanwhile, our extra content and subscription strategy generated $1.3 billion in net revenue in fiscal '15 and continues to grow strongly.
Finally, our mobile business at $524 million is now the third largest in Western markets and the  eighth largest worldwide, and we anticipate continued healthy growth going forward.
As well as driving gross margin improvement, we continue to look for opportunities to better leverage our investments. For example, our digital platform strategy will help us better understand and engage with gamers for more efficiently and -- for more efficiently -- efficiency, thank you, and standardizing on one-game engine across studios amortizes core technology development across all our titles and accelerates our innovation.
Bottom line, we believe we can continue to grow non-GAAP EPS into the future.
Moving to the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $896 million, which was $66 million above our guidance and $18 million below last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by sales of Battlefield Hardline and the ongoing strength of our catalog titles. In addition, our mobile business continued to grow led by SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, The Sims FreePlay and The Simpsons: Tapped Out.
One note, because FIFA Online 3 was launched in China in April, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4. We expect to start recognizing revenue for this service in Q1 fiscal '16.
EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $602 million. This resulted in a fiscal year digital revenue of more than $2.2 billion, about 52% of total revenue.
Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $247 million, up 2% over the prior year. The growth of extra content slowed this quarter due to FX headwinds, resulting from the fact that most of the FIFA Ultimate Team business is in Europe and from changes we made to reduce illegitimate coin selling in FIFA Ultimate Team. Nevertheless, for the year, FIFA Ultimate Team expanded over 40% and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. Overall, Ultimate Team grew 53% on top of the prior year's 62% growth.
We took steps during the quarter to reduce the trading of illegitimate FIFA Ultimate Team coins, which had distorted the economy and made it difficult for many players to build the team they wanted. We've made changes to limit the game exploits and automated processes that used to generate those coins and taken steps to rebalance the game economy. However, some risks remain, and we factor those into our Q1 and full year guidance.
Second, our mobile business generated $150 million for the quarter, up 22% over prior year. Premium mobile only accounted for $9 million of the mobile revenue this quarter. Excluding premium, our ongoing mobile business grew 38% year-on-year.
Third, full game downloads added $114 million to the quarter, flat year-on-year, with strong sales of Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Sims 4 offsetting the falloff in Battlefield 4 and Titanfall sales. 
Our Origin service for PC gamers increased its monthly player engagement levels by 2/3 over the previous year and continues to strongly grow revenue and users.
And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $91 million, up $22 million or 32% over the same period last year, driven largely by Battlefield 4 Premium. EA Access again outperformed, and we expect its contribution to accelerate this year as we start to promote the service with Microsoft and continue to add titles to the EA Access Vault.  
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 75.4%, 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline. It was down from 77.4% in Q4 of fiscal '14, primarily due to the strength of our sports titles.
Operating expenses for the quarter were $513 million, up $10 million from last year and $2 million lower than our guidance. The year-on-year increase is primarily due to marketing expenses for Battlefield Hardline.
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 per share, $0.17 above our guidance.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $198 million compared to $281 million in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of titles. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.07 billion, a very significant increase over last year's cash flow of $712 million and above our twice-revised guidance. Fiscal year '15 capital expenditures were $95 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $972 million.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.02 billion or $9.75 per share. Approximately 62% of this was held in the U.S. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.44 per share. 
We far surpassed our expectations for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, we exceeded our original revenue guidance by $219 million, gross margin by 250 basis points, operating cash flow by $267 million and EPS by $0.66 a share. The new EA is delivering more consistent revenue, increasing the proportion of high-margin digital revenue and growing operating margins, earnings and cash flow. 
This has given the board confidence to authorize a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program has a 2-year time frame and replaces the remaining $356 million portion of our previous $750 million buyback program. It represents an expected return to shareholders of approximately 50% of forecasted free cash flow.
On to fiscal 2016 guidance. With regards to the market, we  expect the console transition to continue at a rapid pace and another 22 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 27 million units in place at the end of calendar 2014. This is a much faster growth than in previous generations. Illustrating how far the transition has already come, approximately 4 out of every 5 copies of Battlefield Hardline sold for consoles that were either Xbox One or PlayStation 4.
In addition to the console growth, we are expecting our mobile franchise to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android. We're anticipating the installed base to grow by over 600 million to nearly 3 billion devices by the end of calendar 2015.
On a constant currency basis, we expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 8% to $4.65 billion. The anticipated strength is broad based and driven by the launch of Star Wars Battlefront, the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, the expansion of our mobile business and the addition of Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge and Plants vs. Zombies titles as well as some other unannounced games.
We expect foreign exchange rates will have an impact on our forecasted results. At our FY '16 guided exchange rates, we anticipate an FX headwind of approximately $250 million, leading to our expectation for non-GAAP revenue of $4.4 billion. Volatility in exchange rates during the year may cause us to reconsider these assumptions, and we'll update you on a quarterly basis.
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise about 50 basis points to 71.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue. This forecast reflects gross margin pressure for product mix, since one of our major launches this year is Star Wars Battlefront, a royalty-bearing title. As a reminder, the major non-sports titles last year were Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Sims 4, all of which are wholly owned IP.
Although the dollar's rise has a negative impact on revenue, it has a positive impact on expenses, since about 46% of our R&D expense is outside the U.S. This natural hedge is worth approximately $100 million in FY '16 and offsets the increased investment we're planning for new IP and our digital platform. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.98 billion, marginally down compared to fiscal '15.
This would deliver an operating margin of approximately 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75, up 10% year-on-year. This includes an adverse impact of $0.21 from FX and a benefit of $0.11 due to a change in tax rate. The strong growth of our business outside of the United States is having a long-term benefit to our corporate tax rate, such that we now view our long-term non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%, instead of 25%. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance does not factor in any share repurchases that may take place during the year.
The earnings presentation on our Investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.
On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.25 billion, gross margin of 69.4% and EPS of $1.90.
Segmenting the sales provides further insight into our key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. As a note, all of these revenue numbers assume guidance exchange rates. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $1.85 billion, down 11%, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery. Digital revenue is forecasted to be nearly $2.55 billion, up 14%.
Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group. Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 25%, as we broaden our revenue base through the launch of more free-to-download games based on our own IP such as Need for Speed and licensed IP such as Star Wars and Minions, while continue to generate income from existing titles.
In addition, the headwind remaining from the winding down of our premium mobile business is now very small.
Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow in line with last year's growth. Full game downloads on current-generation consoles are now over 20% for a newly launched game, and we're seeing higher percentages for our catalog titles. As a reminder, we count bundled games as physical sales, regardless of whether it's a disk or downloaded code in a box with the console. We've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010, and we believe the same forces that drove this on PC are at play on the latest generation of consoles.
Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by FIFA Online 3 and Ultimate Team. Our strongest markets for Ultimate Team are overseas, so this forecast bakes in a significant FX headwind as well as the changes we've made to improve the FIFA Ultimate Team experience.
Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to decline approximately 15% to 20% this year, driven by a falloff in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue, partially offset by the growth in EA Access and then by Battlefield Hardline Premium revenue.
GAAP operating expenses for the fiscal year are expected to be around $2.17 billion.
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2016, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion and capital expenses to be approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.05 billion versus $972 million in fiscal 2015.
Focusing on Q1, our Q1 is seasonally the quietest of our fiscal year. And although we have no major launches this quarter, we do anticipate strong catalog sales, particularly of FIFA 15 and Battlefield Hardline, which launched at the very end of Q4. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.14 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.14 as compared to $1.04 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, a 17% decrease compared to last year's $775 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, TitanFall, the launch of 2014 FIFA World Cup and UFC and from Battlefield 4 catalog. The decline is offset by Battlefield Hardline catalog, but we are not planning any HD launches this quarter. Our revenue phasing for FY '16 is different to the prior year, with a much larger proportion in the back half due to our launch schedule. The expected phasing of our revenue is in the earnings presentation posted to our website.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%.
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, $16 million higher compared to last year, driven by the extra week in the quarter, offset somewhat by more favorable exchange rates for overseas expenses.
For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $0.00 per share as compared to $0.19 per share last year.
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on driving our business model and improving profitability. We will continue to leverage one of the core strengths of our business: the reoccurring revenue generated by our annualized titles, live services and ongoing mobile businesses. While not guaranteed, this revenue is highly dependable and accounts for 60% to 70% of our total revenue.
For the next few years, we expect further improvements in gross margin on the order of 100 basis points a year through growing our digital business. In addition, we will continue to invest in new and existing IP and a new technology infrastructure to support our growing live services business.
In marketing, we will continue to increase personalization and customization and leverage our player network to further improve efficiency and impact. These efforts will help us move operating margins from the mid-20s to the high 20s and continue to grow our earnings and cash flow power.
In conclusion, in fiscal '15, we made some considerable progress on our journey. We were able to massively grow earnings and cash generation. And we have built a solid and consistent business with a strong operational foundation that enables us to capitalize on the shift to digital content, the console cycle and the growth of mobile.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

For us, we're thinking about it with kind of 2 bookends, right? 1 bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with, we believe, some upsides, obviously, if things go well. It is Gen4-only in PC. And so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title. It will put, as we said in the script, some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. We've been trying to target 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. And this year, we're forecasting roughly 50 basis points. And much of that is due to the fact that there's a royalty on that to Disney. And at a level of 10 million units, that's a fairly large pressure on gross. So that's -- we're very optimistic and excited about the title. And obviously, the market's been the same way, as the feedback we've seen from, recently, the Disney celebration where we showed the title for the first time. We'll obviously show it more at E3.

As it relates to data collection, we are collecting -- I heard, one stat once that we collect more data on a daily basis than the combined U.S. Library of Congress, which, as you can imagine, is a lot of data. At a more core level, what we're starting to understand better about our players is how engagement works, how engagement works where a player engages on more than one platform, how engagement works where a player plays more than one franchise and the effective engagement over the long-term as it relates to the likelihood that a player will continue and buy the next version of a title, provided we can keep them playing over time.

When we look at how Electronic Arts is constructing its mobile business, there's a couple of key competitive advantages that we're trying to harness. And the first is we have the broadest and most diverse and powerful portfolio of brands in the business, and that translates into very strong organic acquisition advantages. So pound for pound, people have heard of SimCity, The Sims, the products like FIFA, Madden. And organically, they install at very high rates. If you look at how SimCity did over the break, we were generating tens of millions of installs without really spending any money in paid acquisition. That's also combined with a really powerful network that we're designing. So it allows us to cross-promote and understand based on telemetry and data what our gamers are doing at any given time and what's the right message at the right time and what are the right games that we can put in front of them that might interest them. So the combination of a profound organic acquisition advantage coming from brand power and a network effect, we believe will allow us to, from a long-term standpoint, keep marketing and sales as a percentage of revenue very low, very low certainly relative to other mobile game companies. And as we look to grow the business, we'll continue to harness those advantages."

Can you talk a little bit about how EA is working in that space? And are there any meaningful investments there yet? Or is that just still too early? And then if you could also just describe how FIFA is actually monetizing China and remind us how the revenue recognition works? And then finally, Blake, I think you said the new $1 billion buyback anticipates returning about 50% of free cash and then you guided FY '16 to $1 billion. So does that mean that FY '17 free cash should be flat with '16?"

I was not implying at all that '17 free cash flow was going to be down, simply trying to help people understand how we're thinking about return of capital. The goal would be if we were to continue to be able to increase capital over time, we would continue to increase our buybacks over time. And then we're thinking about that as for the 2-year program. And you can see, we started the 2-year program a year ago and then we replaced that with a new 2-year program this year. I'm not predicting what that's going to be for the future, but think about it more like a progression over time versus any guidance around fiscal '17. We're very optimistic about '16 and '17. So that's that piece. The FIFA Online 3 is that's a free-to-play PC game, which means much like in Ultimate Team, you monetize based on collecting and trading players and playing with those players. You don't have to monetize. You can play the game for free. But like all free-to-play games to build a better team, to get farther ahead in the game, to win against your friend, you will possibly monetize to build that team. So revenue recognition issue was simply a onetime issue for us. And that was we were waiting for the formal rollout of the game in China with our partner, Tencent. And that occurred in early April, and thus, the ability to start to recognize revenue. We did not want to recognize revenue until the game was fully functional, fully rolled out, moved from soft beta to hard beta to full rollout and it had all of the features available for gameplay. And that's why we're now starting to recognize. But we shouldn't have a recognition issue going forward on that."

So we look at a couple of components when we think about return of capital to shareholders. We first and foremost believe that, that's the clear goal of the company is to continue to return capital to shareholders. We balance that with 2 things: one, our need for capital internally; and two, our onshore versus offshore balance of capital. Right now, we have about 50% of our capital onshore. Our need for capital in terms of CapEx is roughly $100 million a year as we've talked to. We have obviously our outstanding convert that we will either refinance or pay off over time that's due next summer. And we believe even after that, we have plenty of capital to respond to any opportunities that come our way, either on acquisitions or internal investments. We've got substantial debt capacity based on our performance and substantial onshore cash to be able to address -- or offshore cash for our international acquisitions to be able to address anything that comes along. But we're really focused on driving the business out of our existing IP or licensed IP. We see a huge future for the company with what we have today. And we feel like we want to make sure we're focused on that first and foremost before we run and chase other acquisitions. Doesn't mean we wouldn't do something, but we're very focused on the opportunities that we have today."

They're building on platforms now that have been in the marketplace for a number of years. They're building on the core engine that has launched a number of products, including Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition, all of which have been great properties. And their tried and tested development team have a very, very clear focus and understanding of the type of game they're making. The game is fully playable. We released a gameplay trailer a couple of weeks ago at Celebration. But some of the inside community also got to see a fairly lengthy full gameplay demo, which is very, very exciting. We look forward to showing more of that at E3. But as it stands right now, we feel good about the trajectory and the velocity and our ability to ship that game at the appropriate time this year."

FY '15 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts. With a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global bestsellers and breakout hits. Our",1325,"Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. FY '15 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts. With a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global bestsellers and breakout hits. Our live services for franchises like Battlefield, FIFA, Madden NFL and The Sims are thriving. The communities in our mobile titles continue to grow. And through constant dialogue, we are forging deeper relationships with our players. We broadened our portfolio on key platforms, introduced new service models and delivered quality through stable, scalable and innovative experiences. All of this contributed to outstanding player engagement in EA experiences across console, PC and mobile in FY '15.
Our financial results were consistently strong throughout the year. Revenue and EPS were above our guidance for the full fiscal year, and we have reached an all-time high in operating cash flow. EA today is performing with focus and efficiency, and we're leaning into our strength to deliver great experiences to a growing and diverse audience of players around the world.
Dragon Age: Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline are both terrific examples of the focus we have today. Moving launch dates is never easy, but we are committed to making the hard decisions that will benefit our players. With Dragon Age: Inquisition, those extra few weeks of polish allowed BioWare to deliver a truly epic new experience. Not only did it win dozens of Game of the Year awards. More importantly, our players gave it the highest form of praise, with nearly 200 million hours of Dragon Age: Inquisition played live to date. 
Our Visceral team opened up to player feedback earlier and more than ever before while developing Battlefield Hardline, and the input from our community was a catalyst for great innovation. With the added development time, Battlefield Hardline delivered a complete package for different types of play, core strategy-based Battlefield gameplay that our fans love, fast and fun new multiplayer modes like Hotwire as well as a deep story-driven single-player campaign. We're very happy with how well the game has sold to date and, more importantly, that we've brought many new fans into the Battlefield universe.
Meanwhile, EA SPORTS had one of its best performance ever. Nearly 6 months after launch, FIFA 15 remains a top 5 title in the Western world, with more than 18 million matches played on average every day in Q4. Gameplay hours of Madden NFL 15 were up nearly 30% for the quarter over last year and the hours played in Madden NFL Ultimate Team in the quarter increased a massive 97% year-over-year. Passionate sports fans are spending more time in our games today and engaging in our Ultimate Team modes to extend the fun long after the season is over. We continue to see major growth in player engagement with our live services and digital offerings across all platforms. Our investment in Battlefield 4 brought greater stability to the experience and allowed us to apply our learning to ensure that Battlefield Hardline was stable and scalable at launch and beyond. We now have 2 Battlefield experiences with large highly-engaged audiences, and both will receive new expansion pack in the coming months.
Other services are showing strong momentum with players as well. Monthly engagement levels on Origin were up significantly over the previous year, and the subscriber base for EA Access continues to grow as we learn more about the innovative new delivery model on console.
For players on smartphones and tablets, we've built a strong foundation of key titles, and now we're adding to it. Players are going deeper into SimCity BuildIt, logging more than 2.4 billion game sessions in Q4. And Madden NFL Mobile continues to capture more sports gamers, with gameplay up 25% over the previous quarter. But perhaps the greatest example of our core strength in mobile, designing experiences that will provide years of entertainment, is The Simpsons: Tapped Out. Nearly 3 years after launch, The Simpsons: Tapped Out averaged more than 16 million monthly players throughout FY '15. We are building some excellent momentum in our mobile business, and we're excited to launch new Minions and Star Wars experiences later this year. 
In FY '15, we captured hundreds of millions of players with new RPG, sports, shooter, simulation and casual experiences across console, PC and mobile devices. Now as we look at the opportunities ahead of us in FY '16, we are positioned to build relationships with millions more through entirely new experiences as well as new games in our major franchises.
Just 3 weeks ago, the world got its latest look at Star Wars Battlefront from our DICE Studio. The reaction has been powerful. Our Star Wars Battlefront trailer has been watched more than 29 million times to date across social platforms. Brought to life through an unprecedented partnership with Disney and Lucasfilms, Star Wars Battlefront will immerse players into the Star Wars universe like never before. The power of our Frostbite engine technology enables us to deliver intricately detailed visuals and a completely authentic environment for players to live out their Star Wars fantasies. Anticipation is now building for the launch of Star Wars Battlefront in November, and we're excited to be part of one of the biggest global pop culture events of the year with the return of Star Wars. We look forward to showing more of Star Wars Battlefront to players at E3 in just a few weeks.
In addition to Star Wars Battlefront, we will leverage the breadth of our IP to reach a wider audience of players across multiple genres and platforms in FY '16. EA SPORTS will excite fans throughout the summer and fall with the latest releases of Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL and NBA Live, including industry-leading gameplay, compelling new features and fresh Ultimate team experiences.
FY '16 will see the return of Need For Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well a new mobile game. 
Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple-game pack and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 community.
After Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare became a sensation last year with console players young and old, we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience in FY '16 that we'll share more about at E3.
Minions Paradise, our first game with the popular franchise in partnership with Illumination Entertainment will be one of at least 5 new EA Mobile titles this year.
In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its  stunning first-person gameplay.
And of course, we'll continue to bring new content to our communities in Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield 4, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Star Wars: The Old Republic, our EA SPORTS titles and EA Mobile games. Our live services will continue to keep these experiences fresh and fun for players throughout the year.
Across the world today, more people are playing games and spending more time playing games than ever before. The audience is wider and more diverse than we have ever known. Games are truly becoming the best form of entertainment, and EA is well positioned to benefit. Building relationships with new players and strengthening existing ones through meaningful engagement is at the core of our objectives as a company. We are continuing to invest in our digital platform, infrastructure, security, live service systems and community engagement teams to scale the needs of a growing global player base that hold games as a vital and intrinsic part of their lives.
FY '15 was a transformative year for EA as we put our players first, delivered amazing high-quality games and services and drove greater speed and efficiency into our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q4 financial performance and a view into the year ahead."
27963,291348854,804710,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into the details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. When we first started talking about imp",2660,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into the details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take 3 years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in 2 years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal '15 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. 
We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points from 56% of net revenue in fiscal '13 to just 46% in fiscal '15. And we've done so without adversely impacting our revenue or the effectiveness of our R&D or marketing. This year, we delivered the best Dragon Age of all time, grew our sports franchises, expanded a core franchise with Battlefield Hardline and announced new IP including Star Wars Battlefront. In addition, we continued to grow our digital live services and leveraged our IP portfolio to establish a strong position on mobile platforms. Our core product catalog and digital live services are helping the company deliver more consistent, repeatable revenue and cash flow each year.
These improvements have more than quadrupled our free cash flow over the same period from 2000 -- or 2 -- or $218 million in fiscal '13 to $972 million in fiscal '15 and driven a threefold increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS from $0.84 a share to $2.51 a share. But there's plenty of road left to travel on our journey to build both great games and shareholder value. Most significantly, the digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still at its infancy. This transformation presents opportunity to continue to grow margins by increasing the proportion of full game downloads, by providing extra content for games and by taking our IP to mobile platforms. Downloads of our games for current-generation consoles continue to increase. Meanwhile, our extra content and subscription strategy generated $1.3 billion in net revenue in fiscal '15 and continues to grow strongly.
Finally, our mobile business at $524 million is now the third largest in Western markets and the eighth largest worldwide, and we anticipate continued healthy growth going forward.
As well as driving gross margin improvement, we continue to look for opportunities to better leverage our investments. For example, our digital platform strategy will help us better understand and engage with gamers for more efficiently and -- for more efficiently -- efficiency, thank you, and standardizing on one-game engine across studios amortizes core technology development across all our titles and accelerates our innovation.
Bottom line, we believe we can continue to grow non-GAAP EPS into the future.
Moving to the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $896 million, which was $66 million above our guidance and $18 million below last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by sales of Battlefield Hardline and the ongoing strength of our catalog titles. In addition, our mobile business continued to grow led by SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, The Sims FreePlay and The Simpsons: Tapped Out.
One note, because FIFA Online 3 was launched in China in April, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4. We expect to start recognizing revenue for this service in Q1 fiscal '16.
EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $602 million. This resulted in a fiscal year digital revenue of more than $2.2 billion, about 52% of total revenue.
Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $247 million, up 2% over the prior year. The growth of extra content slowed this quarter due to FX headwinds, resulting from the fact that most of the FIFA Ultimate Team business is in Europe and from changes we made to reduce illegitimate coin selling in FIFA Ultimate Team. Nevertheless, for the year, FIFA Ultimate Team expanded over 40% and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. Overall, Ultimate Team grew 53% on top of the prior year's 62% growth.
We took steps during the quarter to reduce the trading of illegitimate FIFA Ultimate Team coins, which had distorted the economy and made it difficult for many players to build the team they wanted. We've made changes to limit the game exploits and automated processes that used to generate those coins and taken steps to rebalance the game economy. However, some risks remain, and we factored those into our Q1 and full year guidance.
Second, our mobile business generated $150 million for the quarter, up 22% over prior year. Premium mobile only accounted for $9 million of the mobile revenue this quarter. Excluding premium, our ongoing mobile business grew 38% year-on-year.
Third, full game downloads added $114 million to the quarter, flat year-on-year, with strong sales of Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Sims 4 offsetting the falloff in Battlefield 4 and TitanFall sales. 
Our Origin service for PC gamers increased its monthly player engagement levels by 2/3 over the previous year and continues to strongly grow revenue and users.
And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $91 million, up $22 million or 32% over the same period last year, driven largely by Battlefield 4 Premium. EA Access again outperformed, and we expect its contribution to accelerate this year as we start to promote the service with Microsoft and continue to add titles to the EA Access Vault.  
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 75.4%, 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline. It was down from 77.4% in Q4 fiscal '14, primarily due to the strength of our sports titles.
Operating expenses for the quarter were $513 million, up $10 million from last year and $2 million lower than our guidance. The year-on-year increase is primarily due to marketing expenses for Battlefield Hardline.
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 per share, $0.17 above our guidance.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $198 million compared to $281 million in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of titles. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.07 billion, a very significant increase over last year's cash flow of $712 million and above our twice-revised guidance. Fiscal year '15 capital expenditures were $95 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $972 million.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.02 billion or $9.75 per share. Approximately 62% of this was held in the U.S. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.44 per share. 
We far surpassed our expectations for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, we exceeded our original revenue guidance by $219 million, gross margin by 250 basis points, operating cash flow by $267 million and EPS by $0.66 a share. The new EA is delivering more consistent revenue, increasing the proportion of high-margin digital revenue and growing operating margins, earnings and cash flow. 
This has given the board confidence to authorize a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program has a 2-year time frame and replaces the remaining $356 million portion of our previous $750 million buyback program. It represents an expected return to shareholders of approximately 50% of forecasted free cash flow.
On to fiscal 2016 guidance. With regards to the market, we  expect the console transition to continue at a rapid pace and another 22 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 27 million units in place at the end of calendar 2014. This is a much faster growth than in previous generations. Illustrating how far the transition has already come, approximately 4 out of every 5 copies of Battlefield Hardline sold for consoles that were either Xbox One or PlayStation 4.
In addition to the console growth, we are expecting our mobile franchise to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android. We're anticipating the installed base to grow by over 600 million to nearly 3 billion devices by the end of calendar 2015.
On a constant currency basis, we expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 8% to $4.65 billion. The anticipated strength is broad based and driven by the launch of Star Wars Battlefront, the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, the expansion of our mobile business and the addition of Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge and Plants vs. Zombies titles as well as some other unannounced games.
We expect foreign exchange rates will have an impact on our forecasted results. At our FY '16 guided exchange rates, we anticipate an FX headwind of approximately $250 million, leading to our expectation for non-GAAP revenue of $4.4 billion. Volatility in exchange rates during the year may cause us to reconsider these assumptions, and we'll update you on a quarterly basis.
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise about 50 basis points to 71.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue. This forecast reflects gross margin pressure for product mix, since one of our major launches this year is Star Wars Battlefront, a royalty-bearing title. As a reminder, the major non-sports titles last year were Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Sims 4, all of which are wholly-owned IP.
Although the dollar's rise has a negative impact on revenue, it has a positive impact on expenses, since about 46% of our R&D expense is outside the U.S. This natural hedge is worth approximately $100 million in FY '16 and offsets the increased investment we're planning for new IP and our digital platform. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.98 billion, marginally down compared to fiscal '15.
This would deliver an operating margin of approximately 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75, up 10% year-on-year. This includes an adverse impact of $0.21 from FX and a benefit of $0.11 due to a change in tax rate. The strong growth of our business outside of the United States is having a long-term benefit to our corporate tax rate, such that we now view our long-term non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%, instead of 25%. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance does not factor in any share repurchases that may take place during the year.
The earnings presentation on our Investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.
On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.25 billion, gross margin of 69.4% and EPS of $1.90.
Segmenting the sales provides further insight into our key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. As a note, all of these revenue numbers assumed guidance exchange rates. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $1.85 billion, down 11%, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery. Digital revenue is forecasted to be nearly $2.55 billion, up 14%.
Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group. Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 25%, as we broaden our revenue base through the launch of more free-to-download games based on our own IP, such as Need for Speed, and licensed IP, such as Star Wars and Minions, while continuing to generate income from existing titles.
In addition, the headwind remaining from the winding down of our premium mobile business is now very small.
Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow in line with last year's growth. Full game downloads on current-generation consoles are now over 20% for a newly launched game, and we're seeing higher percentages for our catalog titles. As a reminder, we count bundled games as physical sales, regardless of whether it's a disk or a downloaded code in a box with the console. We've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010, and we believe the same forces that drove this on PC are at play on the latest generation of consoles.
Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by FIFA Online 3 and Ultimate Team. Our strongest markets for Ultimate Team are overseas, so this forecast bakes in a significant FX headwind as well as the changes we've made to improve the FIFA Ultimate Team experience.
Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to decline approximately 15% to 20% this year, driven by a falloff in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue, partially offset by the growth in EA Access and then by Battlefield Hardline Premium revenue.
GAAP operating expenses for the fiscal year are expected to be around $2.17 billion.
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2016, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion and capital expenses to be approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.05 billion versus $972 million in fiscal 2015.
Focusing on Q1, our Q1 is seasonally the quietest of our fiscal year. And although we have no major launches this quarter, we do anticipate strong catalog sales, particularly of FIFA 15 and Battlefield Hardline, which launched at the very end of Q4. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.14 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.14 as compared to $1.04 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, a 17% decrease compared to last year's $775 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, TitanFall, the launch of 2014 FIFA World Cup and UFC and from Battlefield 4 catalog. The decline is offset by Battlefield Hardline catalog, but we are not planning any HD launches this quarter. Our revenue phasing for FY '16 is different to the prior year, with a much larger proportion in the back half due to our launch schedule. The expected phasing of our revenue is in the earnings presentation posted to our website.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%.
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, $16 million higher compared to last year, driven by the extra week in the quarter, offset somewhat by more favorable exchange rates for overseas expenses.
For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $0.00 per share as compared to $0.19 per share last year.
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on driving our business model and improving profitability. We will continue to leverage one of the core strengths of our business: the reoccurring revenue generated by our annualized titles, live services and ongoing mobile businesses. While not guaranteed, this revenue is highly dependable and accounts for 60% to 70% of our total revenue.
For the next few years, we expect further improvements in gross margin on the order of 100 basis points a year through growing our digital business. In addition, we will continue to invest in new and existing IP and a new technology infrastructure to support our growing live services business.
In marketing, we will continue to increase personalization and customization and leverage our player network to further improve efficiency and impact. These efforts will help us move operating margins from the mid-20s to the high 20s and continue to grow our earnings and cash flow power.
In conclusion, in fiscal '15, we made some considerable progress on our journey. We were able to massively grow earnings and cash generation. And we have built a solid and consistent business with a strong operational foundation that enables us to capitalize on the shift to digital content, the console cycle and the growth of mobile.

For us, we're thinking about it with kind of 2 bookends, right? 1 bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with, we believe, some upsides, obviously, if things go well. It is Gen4-only in PC. And so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title. It will put, as we said in the script, some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. We've been trying to target 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. And this year, we're forecasting roughly 50 basis points. And much of that is due to the fact that there's a royalty on that to Disney. And at a level of 10 million units, that's a fairly large pressure on gross. So that's -- we're very optimistic and excited about the title. And obviously, the market's been the same way, as the feedback we've seen from, recently, the Disney celebration where we showed the title for the first time. We'll obviously show it more at E3.

I think going forward, for your model, I'd probably focus on $10 million to $15 million a quarter. And as that business grows, we'll keep you updated. We're very optimistic about it. Tencent has been very public around their optimism. But we remind people, it's taken us 3 to 4 years to grow Korean awareness today. And Korea is a more affluent market than China right now. And so it's probably going to take some time. Also software is much more prevalent in Korea than it is in China, but it's growing fast in China. So we hope to follow that. So it's a longer story for us, we think. But I think there's a lot of potential, and everything is going very well. Frank, on the mobile?"

When we look at how Electronic Arts is constructing its mobile business, there's a couple of key competitive advantages that we're trying to harness. And the first is we have the broadest and most diverse and powerful portfolio of brands in the business, and that translates into very strong organic acquisition advantages. So pound for pound, people have heard of SimCity, The Sims, the products like FIFA, Madden. And organically, they install at very high rates. If you looked at how SimCity did over the break, we were generating tens of millions of installs without really spending any money in paid acquisition. That's also combined with a really powerful network that we're designing. So it allows us to cross-promote and understand, based on telemetry and data, what our gamers are doing at any given time, and what's the right message at the right time and what are the right games that we can put in front of them that might interest them. So the combination of a profound organic acquisition advantage coming from brand power and a network effect, we believe will allow us to, from a long-term standpoint, keep marketing and sales as a percentage of revenue very low, very low certainly relative to other mobile game companies. And as we look to grow the business, we'll continue to harness those advantages."

We've now added -- we've got 12 titles in the vault. And that's why we feel like it's a great time to start to promote it because much of the value is around those titles in the vault. The subscriber base continues to grow. It's still not a meaningful part of our financials. And thus, we're not calling out the actual numbers or the staff, but we will consider that in the future as we see how it grows.

So that's that piece. The FIFA Online 3 is that's a free-to-play PC game, which means much like in Ultimate Team, you monetize based on collecting and trading players and playing with those players. You don't have to monetize. You can play the game for free. But like all free-to-play games, to build a better team, to get farther ahead in the game, to win against your friends, you will possibly monetize to build that team. The revenue recognition issue was simply a onetime issue for us. And that was we were waiting for the formal rollout of the game in China with our partner, Tencent. And that occurred in early April, and thus, the ability to start to recognize revenue. We did not want to recognize revenue until the game was fully functional, fully rolled out, moved from soft beta to hard beta to full rollout and it had all of the features available for gameplay. And that's why we're now starting to recognize. But we shouldn't have a recognition issue going forward on that."

But I want to make it very clear that whether it's a code or a physical disk, it goes into a bundle that is primarily put together by our first-party platform partners. That is physical media to us, and that's how it's accounted for. Our full game downloads that you're seeing, they do vary from title and by geography. But the latest data we've got shows us at 20%-plus for Battlefield Hardline, and that's up from about 13% to 15% this time last year for our AAA title releases, so we're seeing the growth. And as Andrew said, if we're -- we stay on a path that's analogous to the PC, that will continue to grow over the coming fiscal years."

Q1 was a great start to fiscal year 2016 as we continue our journey to put our players first and deliver amazing entertainment experience following. We're building deeper connections with the players in our games and live services there is tremendous resentment for upcoming titles and we see profound new energy in our industry. 
Our Q1 results were excellent, with revenue margins and earnings above our guidance. Our top games and large services, including EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, The Sims 4, are engaging players around the world with fresh new experiences. We see continued strength in our mobile trials with new games coming later this year. EA is executing well against our plans for FY '16. And with ongoing strength in our digital business and growing anticipation for upcoming titles, we are raising our full year guidance today to reflect momentum across the portfolio. 
Our industry is hitting a powerful stride as we advance further into the new global era for games. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 installed base continues to grow and show great strength, driving well beyond adoption rates of previous generation devices. 
The opportunities in mobile, as well as new service and delivery models, are opening up new ways to bring players into our games than ever before. At the E3 conference in Germany, the appetite for great new games was for you. Players on all platforms are ready for new experiences that capture the imagination with creativity, innovation and breakthrough gameplay. 
EA is in a strong position to deliver. We had an outstanding E3 this year sure taking 15 to our players, media and partners. Throughout the event, our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm was in full view. Star Wars Battlefront stunned audiences with a magnitude and really some of it being play. We revealed a new expansion for Star Wars expression and announced the new Star Wars mobile game. We unveiled new expenses for original IP with Andromeda, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 and surprised with the unexpected charm of Unravel. 
We celebrated the return of Need for Speed, captivated players with the authenticity of our sports games and detail the gameplay innovation in Mirror's Edge: Catalyst. At 10 days, we're able to go hands-on with all of these years titles in our E3 business. 
Most importantly, through content and social conversation, we brought the E3 experience to players around the world. Millions of viewers joined this team of our light event and our titles were mentioned more than 500 times per minute on social media during the week of E3. Trailers, gameplay and live streams of targets were viewed over 53 million times throughout E3 and Star Wars Battlefront alone generated 22 million views on social platforms, a most popular content ever at E3. It was tremendous to see such positive reaction from players and feel the excitement level for our games continuing to build. 
We're looking forward to sharing more at games in just a few days. 
In addition to our upcoming games, our launch service today are ecosystems of ever-changing content for our players. Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players load a combined 170 million online gameplay hours in Q1 and will be bringing new expansion perhaps in both experiences in the coming months. 
The Sims 4 play community continues to grow and engage deeply with the game as we deliver more updating content. And we saw gameplay hours in our mobile hit, The Sims FreePlay increased 85% year-over-year. 
In addition, our EA SPORTS ultimate team modes average of the 2 million players per day in Q1, up nearly 20% year-over-year. Amazing and created new experiences, dynamic-wide services and deeply engaged communities built on strong and meaningful relationships with our players. These are the building blocks of our long-term strategy for Electronic Arts. 
Throughout key franchises as well as experiences with new and original IP, we have the ability to rich more players than ever. EA Access Origin and our new extremity games trailer are bringing more player games to compete, connect and feel their passion for games. 
And with our digital infrastructure, analytics and large services, we are evolving and personalizing experience for each players, and exploring how first game services and create additional value for everyone. 
After a strong first quarter, the stage is now set for us to deliver a slate and groundbreaking and is stunning new games through the remainder of FY '16. 
I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deep look at our financials."
27963,306398024,843463,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than prior years because we had no title on launches this quarter. And the year ago quarter included",1190,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than prior years because we had no title on launches this quarter. And the year ago quarter included the launches of Titanfall for Xbox 360, EA SPORTS FIFA World Cup 2014 and EA SPORTS UFC. 
Our core business was strong. At a constant currency, this quarter's revenue would have been within 4% of last year's. 
As I discussed the results for the quarter, bear in mind that FX changes have had a dramatic impact on year-on-year comparisons. The euro, for example, fell nearly 20% against the dollar from the first quarter last year to this year's first quarter. 
In the first quarter, EA SPORTS, FIFA 15 Battlefield Hardline and The Sims 4 drove solid revenue and delivered excellent margins. This demonstrates the power of our deep catalog of popular IT, which delivers stable revenue throughout the year. The revenue and margin versus guidance were driven by better-than-expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 10% year-over-year to $532 million, 77% from this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 20% to $2.28 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $255 million, up 21% over the prior year. The principal driver of this growth was FIFA Online 3 in China. $31 million of the FIFA Online free revenue was deferred from previous quarter as noted in our last earnings call. 
Total Ultimate Team was down 6% year-on-year, but up 3% on a constant currency basis, even with the World Cup boosting FIFA Ultimate Team engagement levels last year. 
Mobile generated $122 million in the quarter. Digital extra contents and advertising was up 11% versus the prior year to $115 million, while premium mobile full game download revenue was just $7 million, down 56% compared to the prior year. 
We expect premium full game download revenue to be remain at this minimal level for the foreseeable future. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $84 million of revenue, up 18% over the prior year. We continue to see the digital download increase as a percentage of full game sales, although this quarter was particularly high since our catalog titles typically ske more towards digital download than newly launched games. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenues contributed $71 million, down 11% from last year due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth, and we continue to build this value of gamers as we add more games to the vault. 
Titanfall is now in the vault and Dragon Age Inquisition will join us at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.8%, an increase from last year's 70.2% and better than our guidance of 74.5%. 
Growth over the prior year was driven by product mix, the shift to digital and FIFA Online 3 in China. We exceeded guidance largely through better-than-expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and the continued success of The Sims 4, which delivers very high margins by virtue of being a PC title based on fully owned IP. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $472 million, up $13 million or 3% year-on-year. The increase over last year was driven by R&D payroll tax expenses related to stock-based compensation, which is written with the stock price and by the extra week in the quarter. This is offset by FX and lower marketing costs as a result of no major launches this quarter. 
The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 a share, which is $0.15 better than guidance due to strong revenue and higher gross margin. 
As a reminder, this calculated at our new tax rate of 22%. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.88 billion or approximately $9.23 per share. 64% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. 
Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $71 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $992 million, a record for this period. 
During Q1, we repurchased 2.2 million shares on a cost of $132 million. Our $1 billion stock buyback program was initiated partly through Q1 in May 2015 and has a 2-year time frame. As of the end of the first quarter, there was $925 million left on the $1 billion plan as some of the stock repurchased during the quarter was bought into the old plan. Due to the strength of our business, we are increasing our full year guidance. 
For fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue was up by $50 million to $4.45 billion and our non-GAAP EPS increases $0.10 to $2.85 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of 27%. 
It's still early in the year, and with Q1 representing less than 16% of expected full year revenues, we believe some continued conservatism is appropriate. 
A GAAP guidance becomes $4.3 billion in revenue and $1.98 of fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the year, we are reiterating our operating cash flow guidance for approximately $1.15 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.05 billion. 
Guidance for our second quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. 
In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports data, it also included The Sims 4. 
In addition, FX present a year-on-year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenue. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 63%. Again, the main difference between this quarter and a year ago quarter is the launch of The Sims 4. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $510 million, up slightly year-on-year, driven by an increased investment in R&D and offset by FX and savings and marketing. This resulted in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.73 per share last year. 
Our Q2 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $815 million as compared to $990 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $0.58 as compared to $0.01 per share profit in the prior year. 
We're very pleased with our first quarter results. Our ability to reliably generate earnings even in the absence of major launches is a testament to the value of our broad IT portfolio, our catalog and our robust live services. 
Digital extra content and mobile continue to provide additional layers of consistent revenue. On top of this, player reactions are marquee titles at E3 gives us great confidence that our competitive position as we look forward into this year and beyond. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew"

The excitement for this game continues to build. It took them 45 awards from E3, including Game of the Year for IBM and Best Online Multiplayer from the E3 Game Critics.

One, last year, both Titanfall and UFC our royalty bearing titles. So they have dampened last year's gross margin a little bit. But the real driver for us was the strength, as you noted FIFA Online 3, obviously, some of that deferred revenues are coming in at very nice gross margin. But second and probably more importantly, the strength of The Sims 4. And just to give people a reminder, last year, the sentence started a little slow growth into our thinking. We talked about that in our Q2 earnings. But the strength of The Sims franchises, the layering in our expansion packs that really fuel not just the expansion pack revenue, but bring people into the core game. And we were in a situation where many consumers were comparing the original Sims 4 game to the Sims 3 game with a long series of expansion packs. And as a now start to bring out expansion packs, they're starting to see the power of The Sims 4 gameplay and the excitement around it. And we sold more Sims 4 this quarter than we thought. And we think that trend will continue and we're very excited about it not just because of the franchises, but because of the power to the drive to the gross margin. And then last but not least as you saw the digital business as a whole with 77% of our total revenue, and that included a large amount of full game downloads, which obviously enhances margin, as well as all the other components of the digital business, which enhanced our gross margin. And that really helped the overall delivery relative to plan. Now in terms of FIFA Ultimate Team, and I encourage Peter or Andrew to jump in on this if they'd like. First, we saw, as you said Ultimate Team down slightly, but up on a constant currency basis. And a key reminder there is the comparison year-over-year was the FIFA Ultimate Team did extremely well in the first quarter last year because of the World Cup and all of the people playing associated with the World Cup and the World Cup modes that have in the game. We did see a better performance of FIFA Ultimate Team that we expected. As you remember in Q1, we -- our last call, Q4, excuse me, we did some warning that because the illegitimate coin selling we thought that we would see some slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team mainly because the actions we take the standing. Much of that will be corrected in the new version of FIFA Ultimate Team that comes out with FIFA 16, and we're excited about that. And we don't see any change to our outlook for the overall extra content and Ultimate Team business in the future. And as you can see, we were surprised that we did better than expected on Ultimate Team in the quarter, which also helped drive margins. There's a lot of excitement about soccer in the world. The women's World Cup in Canada really drove huge amount of excitement in North America. We're seeing a greater amount of excitement across Asia. And we think that will continue to help drive both the FIFA product and Ultimate Team product over time."

So OpEx -- the OpEx that we get guidance on as the start of the year obviously had a change in terms of the guidance. We have built into that OpEx, r&D investment and both console and mobile products, and that's why you're seeing a slight uptick. The OpEx of this quarter was driven primarily by the options or RFU exercises and the tax expenses associated with those. We didn't forecast the stock price to be as high as it turned out to be was a bit higher than we expected. Still, obviously, within our guidance and we're comfortable with our full year guidance on OpEx. We're continuing to try to be extremely efficient in R&D and continue to try to build better system to drive marketing expenses around the great digital connection we have with our users, our gamers and consumers out there. And you'll hopefully see continued benefit to that over time. In terms of the guidance and products, Unravel was in the original guidance. I don't think the expectations around the love for Yarny himself was quite built into our guidance. And we were pleasantly surprised at E3 about how popular he was. But it's still a fairly small [indiscernible]  added any products our guidance that was not the reason that we raised the number the number was raised primarily due to the positive reception we saw across all of our products and the strength of the industry, as Andrew mentioned, the excitement we've seen our own console gaming and the continued popularity of both Xbox and PlayStation and the strength of that going forward.

We have to think about business model. We have to think about appropriate culturalized content and the ability to fulfill the motivations that they have for social connection and competition, which differs from how we play in the West or even in other Asian markets. I believe that both Sony and Microsoft are committed to driving the business there. I feel that we have content that should be able to kind of navigate through those key elements has appeal in China.

We published it chart on our website, our IR website, that shows various stock levels I would that's all that and note that there's a difference between the GAAP share count and the non-GAAP share count because GAAP accounting excludes the benefit of the bond hedge so it shows the full dilution versus what comes in through the bond head where the non-GAAP share count is obviously unaffected by it. A couple of notes. As many people see with convert, particularly ones that are well in the money like ours, there often is early conversion request that come in. And shortly after the last coupon payment, we saw a jump in early conversion request. I believe people are simply making a calculation as do they take their money now or borrow money to carry it for the rest of the year. And typically the borrowing cost is offset, not fully offset by the coupon. And so you're seeing some early convergence. And we've had over $165 million of early convergence that will get paid out over the next 3 months. There's a time lapse. And so our assumption is we'll continue see some of that over the next year as people get closer to the conversion date next July. And our intention is to look through ways to obviously potentially refinance that in a capital structure. We talk about a potential permanent layer of debt or another convert and/or just paying it all out, and we're looking through all those options and more to come. But we appreciate the fact that there will be a lot of dilution and we're looking at ways to minimize that dilution going forward."

Q1 was a great start to fiscal year 2016 as we continue our journey to put our players first and deliver amazing entertainment experience for them. We're building deeper connections with players in our games and live services. There is tremendous excitement for upcoming titles, and we see profound new energy in our industry. 
Our Q1 results were excellent, with revenue margins and earnings above our guidance. Our top games and large services, including EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, The Sims 4, are engaging players around the world with fresh new experiences. We see continued strength in our mobile titles with new games coming later this year. EA is executing well against our plans for FY '16. And with ongoing strength in our digital business and growing anticipation for our upcoming titles, we are raising our full-year guidance today to reflect momentum across the portfolio. 
Our industry is hitting a powerful stride as we advance further into the new global era for games. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 installed base continues to grow and show great strength, driving well beyond adoption rates of previous generation devices. 
The opportunities in mobile as well as new service and delivery models are opening more ways to bring players into our games than ever before. At the E3 conference in Germany, the appetite for great new games was clear. Players on all platforms are ready for new experiences that capture their imagination with creativity, innovation and breakthrough gameplay. 
EA is in a strong position to deliver. We had an outstanding E3 this year, showcasing 15 new games to our players, media and partners. Throughout the event, our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm was in full view. Star Wars Battlefront stunned audiences with the magnitude and realism of its gameplay. We revealed a new expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic and announced a new Star Wars mobile game. We unveiled new expenses for original IP with Mass Effect: Andromeda, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 and surprised with the unexpected charm of Unravel. 
We celebrated the return of Need for Speed, captivated players with the authenticity of our upcoming sports games and detailed the gameplay innovation in Mirror's Edge Catalyst. Attendees were able to go hands-on with all of this year's titles at our E3 booth. 
Most importantly, through content and social conversation, we brought the E3 experience to players around the world. Millions of viewers joined the stream of our light event, and our titles were mentioned more than 500 times per minute on social media during the week of E3. Trailers, gameplay and live streams of our games were viewed over 53 million times throughout E3. And Star Wars Battlefront alone generated 22 million views on social platforms, our most popular content ever at E3. It was tremendous to see such positive reaction from players and feel the excitement level for our games continuing to build. 
We're looking forward to sharing more at Gamescom in just a few days. 
In addition to our upcoming games, our live service today are ecosystems of ever-changing content for our players. Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players logged a combined 170 million online gameplay hours in Q1, and we'll be bringing new expansion packs to both experiences in the coming months. 
The Sims 4 player community continues to grow and engage deeply with the game as we deliver more update and new content. And we saw gameplay hours in our mobile hit, The Sims FreePlay increase 85% year-over-year. 
In addition, our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team modes averaged over 2 million players per day in Q1, up nearly 20% year-over-year. Amazing and creative new experiences, dynamic live services and deeply-engaged communities built on strong and meaningful relationships with our players, these are the building blocks of our long-term strategy for Electronic Arts. 
Through our key franchises as well as experiences with new and original IP, we have the ability to reach more players than ever. EA Access, Origin and our new Xfinity Games beta are bringing more players in to compete, connect and fuel their passion for games. 
And with our digital infrastructure, analytics and live services, we are evolving and personalizing the experience for each player, and exploring how cross-game services can create additional value for everyone. 
After a strong first quarter, the stage is now set for us to deliver a slate of groundbreaking and stunning new games through the remainder of FY '16. 
I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."

EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than prior years because we had no console title launches this quarter, and the year-ago quarter included the launches of Titanfall for Xbox 360, EA SPORTS FIFA World Cup 2014 and EA SPORTS UFC. 
Our core business was strong. And at constant currency, this quarter's revenue would would've been within 4% of last year's. 
As I discussed the results for the quarter, bear in mind that FX changes have had a dramatic impact on year-on-year comparisons. The euro, for example, fell nearly 20% against the dollar from the first quarter last year to this year's first quarter. 
In the first quarter, EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline and The Sims 4 drove solid revenue and delivered excellent margins. This demonstrates the power of our deep catalog of popular IP, which delivers a base of stable revenue throughout the year. The revenue and margin beats versus guidance were driven by better-than-expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 10% year-over-year to $532 million, 77% from this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 20% to $2.28 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $255 million, up 21% over the prior year. The principal driver of this growth was FIFA Online 3 in China. $31 million of the FIFA Online 3 revenue was deferred from previous quarters, as noted in our last earnings call. 
Total Ultimate Team was down 6% year-on-year, but up 3% on a constant-currency basis, even with the World Cup boosting FIFA Ultimate Team engagement levels last year. 
Mobile generated $122 million in the quarter. Digital extra content and advertising was up 11% versus the prior year to $115 million, while premium mobile full game download revenue was just $7 million, down 56% compared to the prior year. 
We expect premium full game download revenue to remain at this minimal level for the foreseeable future. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $84 million of revenue, up 18% over the prior year. We continue to see the digital downloads increase as a percentage of full game sales, although this quarter was particularly high since our catalog titles typically skew more towards digital download than do newly launched games. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $71 million, down 11% from last year due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to The Vault. 
Titanfall is now in The Vault, and Dragon Age: Inquisition will join us at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.8%, an increase from last year's 70.2% and better than our guidance of 74.5%. 
Growth over the prior year was driven by product mix, the shift to digital and FIFA Online 3 in China. We exceeded guidance largely through better-than-expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and the continued success of The Sims 4, which delivers very high margins by virtue of being a PC title based on wholly-owned IP. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $472 million, up $13 million or 3% year-on-year. The increase over last year was driven by R&D, payroll tax expenses related to stock-based compensation, which have risen with the stock price, and by the extra week in the quarter. This was offset by FX and lower marketing costs as a result of no major launches this quarter. 
The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 per share, which is $0.15 better than guidance due to strong revenue and higher gross margin. 
As a reminder, this is calculated at our new tax rate of 22%. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.88 billion or approximately $9.23 per share. 64% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. 
Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $71 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $992 million, a record for this period. 
During Q1, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $132 million. Our $1 billion stock buyback program was initiated partway through Q1 in May 2015 and has a 2-year timeframe. As of the end of the first quarter, there was $925 million left on the $1 billion plan, as some of the stock repurchased during the quarter was bought under the old plan. Due to the strength of our business, we are increasing our full year guidance. 
For fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue is up by $50 million to $4.45 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS increases $0.10 to $2.85 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of 27%. 
It's still early in the year. And with Q1 representing less than 16% of expected full year revenues, we believe some continued conservatism is appropriate. 
The GAAP guidance becomes $4.3 billion in revenue and $1.98 of fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the year, we are reiterating our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.15 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.05 billion. 
Guidance for our second quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. 
In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. 
In addition, FX presents a year-on-year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 63%. Again, the main difference between this quarter an the year-ago quarter is the launch of The Sims 4. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $510 million, up slightly year-on-year, driven by an increased investment in R&D and offset by FX and savings in marketing. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.73 per share last year. 
Our Q2 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $815 million as compared to $990 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $0.58 as compared to $0.01 per share profit in the prior year. 
We're very pleased with our first quarter results. Our ability to reliably generate earnings even in the absence of major launches is a testament to the value of our broad IP portfolio, our catalog and our robust live services. 
Digital extra content and mobile continue to provide additional layers of consistent revenue. On top of this, player reactions to our marquee titles at E3 gives us great confidence in our competitive position as we look forward into this year and beyond. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew"

We have a great deal ahead of us over the next 3 quarters as we prepare to deliver a range of new titles from our key franchises and original IP, as well as more new content supplies in our live services. We'll have 4 more EA SPORTS experiences launching through the summer and fall, Madden NFL 16 NHL 16, FIFA 16 and NBA Live 16, all featuring engaging new modes and groundbreaking gameplay for our players. 
Need for Speed will arrive in November, and fans are loving the authentic car culture and deep customization that we've shown so far. And of course, Star Wars Battlefront will launch on November 17. The excitement for this game continues to build. It took home 45 awards from E3, including Best of Show for IGN and Best Online Multiplayer from the E3 Game Critics. We look forward to unveiling new dimensions of Star Wars Battlefront and letting players go hands-on next week at Gamescom. 
We have more new experiences coming throughout the year. Our live services will continue to evolve with new content, we'll have some great new mobile games and we're excited to have 3 new and original IP titles launching in Q4. 
Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect: Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY '17 and another new Star Wars project being led by the dynamic creative team of Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig. 
These are just a few of the new experiences in development across our studios today. 
From the creativity of our teams, to the technologies we are building, to the passion for play that we share with our players, we are pushing the boundaries for games in an effort to deliver the next amazing experience. Through our games and lives services, we will immerse players in new worlds, introducing engaging new characters, and transport them into adventures that capture the imagination. 
In a new global age for games, where more time is spent playing than ever before, we are also building a future with relationships at the core. Through our network, we are connecting players with each other and delivering experiences that are meaningful every time they play. 
I look forward to sharing more updates on our progress in the quarters ahead. 
Now Blake, Peter and I are here for your questions."

I think, Blake, you touched on some of this, but it's a very impressive margin that you've posted in. I'm just hoping if you could provide a little bit more detail on what, in particular, drove that through a combination of, I guess, digital downloads, FIFA Online in China and then whatever else? And then just secondly, in terms of Ultimate Team, I think you've commented that it was up slightly on a constant-currency basis, but down on a reported basis. I know last quarter, there was an illegal coin sell issue, and I know you're working to resolve that. So just curious where you stand as it relates to that. And then how we should be thinking about growth for Ultimate Team for the rest of the year in the context of your extra content revenue?"

One, last year, both Titanfall and UFC are royalty-bearing titles. So they have dampened last year's gross margin a little bit. But the real driver for us was the strength, as you noted, FIFA Online 3. Obviously some of that's deferred revenues, so they're coming in at very nice gross margins. But second, and probably more importantly, the strength of The Sims 4. And just to give people a reminder, last year, The Sims started a little slow relative to our thinking. We talked about that in our Q2 earnings. But the strength of The Sims franchise is the layering in of expansion packs that really fuel not just the expansion pack revenue, but bring people into the core game. And we were in a situation where many consumers were comparing the original Sims 4 game to the Sims 3 game with a long series of expansion packs. And as we now start to bring out expansion packs, they're starting to see the power of The Sims 4 gameplay and the excitement around it. And we sold more Sims 4 this quarter than we thought. And we think that trend will continue, and we're very excited about it not just because of the franchise, but because of the power that it drives to the gross margins. And then last, but not least, as you saw the digital business as a whole with 77% of our total revenue, and that included a large amount of full game downloads, which obviously enhances margin as well as all the other components of the digital business, which enhanced our gross margin. And that really helped the overall delivery relative to plan. Now in terms of FIFA Ultimate Team, and I encourage Peter or Andrew to jump in on this if they like, first, we saw, as you said, Ultimate Team down slightly, but up on a constant-currency basis. And a key reminder there is the comparison year-over-year was that FIFA Ultimate Team did extremely well in the first quarter last year because of the World Cup and all of the people playing associated with the World Cup and the World Cup modes that we have in the game. We did see better performance of FIFA Ultimate Team than we expected. If you remember, in Q1, we -- our last call, before Q4, excuse me, we did some warning that because the illegitimate coin selling, we thought that we would see some slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team mainly because the actions we take can due to price standing. Much of that will be corrected in the new version of FIFA Ultimate Team that comes out with FIFA 16, and we're excited about that. And we don't see any change to our outlook for the overall extra content in the Ultimate Team business in the future. And as you can see, we were surprised that we did better than expected on Ultimate Team in the quarter, which also helped drive margins. There's a lot of excitement about soccer in the world. The Women's World Cup in Canada really drove a huge amount of excitement in North America. We're seeing a great amount of excitement across Asia, and we think that will continue to help drive both the FIFA product and Ultimate Team product over time."

OpEx, the OpEx that we give guidance on at the start of the year obviously hasn't changed in terms of the guidance. We have built into that OpEx R&D investments in both console and mobile products, and that's why you're seeing a slight uptick. The OpEx this quarter was driven primarily by the options or RSU exercises and the tax expenses associated with those. We didn't forecast the stock price to be as high as it turned out to be. It was a little bit higher than we'd expected. Still obviously within our guidance, and we're comfortable with our full year guidance on OpEx. We're continuing to try to be extremely efficient in R&D and continue to try to build better systems to drive marketing expenses around the great digital connection we have with our users, our gamers and consumers out there. You'll hopefully see continued benefits of that over time. In terms of the guidance in products, Unravel was in the original guidance. I don't think the expectations around the love for Yarny himself was quite built into our guidance, and we were pleasantly surprised at E3 about how popular he was. But it's still a fairly small product than is built into our guidance. We haven't added any products to our guidance. That was not the reason that we raised the number. The number was raised primarily due to the positive reception we saw across all of our products, and the strength of the industry, as Andrew mentioned, the excitement we've seen around console gaming and the continued popularity of both Xbox and PlayStation and the strength of that going forward. So that is really the driver to our raised guidance."

This is the first time we've raised guidance in probably 10 or 15 years coming out of the first quarter because only 16% of our business is really booked in the first quarter. We're really excited about Battlefront, but we're also really excited about all of our products. And that excitement drove us to increase our guidance in the quarter. We haven't yet started to think about or talk about publicly what that means in terms of units, partially because it's still early. We want to see how the reaction at the Gamescon to all our price, including Battlefront, as well as how the fall plays out. So I would assume we'll have that discussion in October before we ship those products, and more to come on that.

I will remind everybody on the call that more and more, as we see digital start to take ahold of our consumers, the preorders become less of a key indicator, key leading indicator as to how we predict our business here. But as we came out of E3, and more importantly, as Andrew mentioned, as we come out for what, I think, will be a pivotal moment for Star Wars next week in Cologne, Germany when 265,000 consumers will descend on the Cologne convention center on Thursday, all of whom will be trying desperately to get their hands on this title, we expect to see tremendous response from that. I've seen the build, and the game looks very, very solid, and we're excited to be able to share that. As regards to the question regarding installed base, yes, $49 million at the end of the calendar year. Just some data on that, we're now 20 months in, and then we go like-for-like on the previous generation. We're up 44% installed base hardware versus where we were with Xbox 360, PS3, et al. And our tax rate for software is slightly ahead as well. When correcting for full game downloads, digital full game downloads and hardware bundles, we're 6.1 right now versus 5.9 in the same period in the previous generation."

The same FX impact, $250 million, that's the $4.45 billion in adjusted post-FX revenue. And we presented in our investor pack the FX rate. The reality is the euro's right about the same level as it was when we did our original guidance. We saw a little weakening in the dollar during the quarter up to about $1.13 from $1.09, but that didn't last very long, back down around the $1.09 level.

And then the upside component of that obviously sells in stock. Right now, at the average stock price for the quarter, which was $61.61, that would equal 6.6 million shares of stock that would be used to obviously sell the convert. We published a chart on our website, our IR website, that shows that at various stock levels. So I would consult that and note there's a difference between the GAAP share count and the non-GAAP share count because GAAP accounting excludes the benefit of the bond hedge. So it shows the full dilution versus what comes in through the bond head, where the non-GAAP share count is obviously unaffected by it. A couple of notes. As many people see with converts, particularly ones that are well in the money like ours, there often is early conversion requests that come in. And shortly after the last coupon payment, we saw a jump in early conversion requests. I believe people are simply making a calculation as do they take their money now or borrow money to carry it for the rest of the year. And typically, the borrowing cost is offset -- not fully offset by the coupon. And so you're seeing some early convergence. And we've had over $165 million of early convergence that will get paid out over the next 3 months. So it's a time lapse. And so our assumption is we'll continue to see some of that over the next year as people get closer to the conversion date next July. And our intention is to look through ways to obviously potentially refinance that in the capital structure. We've talked about a potential permanent layer of debt or another convert and/or just paying it all up. And we're looking through all those options and more to come. But we appreciate the fact that there will be a lot of dilution. And we're looking at ways to minimize that dilution going forward."

Q1 was a great start to fiscal year 2016 as we continue our journey to put our players first and deliver amazing entertainment experience for them. We're building deeper connections with players in our games and live services. There is trem",758,"Thanks, Chris. Q1 was a great start to fiscal year 2016 as we continue our journey to put our players first and deliver amazing entertainment experience for them. We're building deeper connections with players in our games and live services. There is tremendous excitement for upcoming titles, and we see profound new energy in our industry. 
Our Q1 results were excellent, with revenue margins and earnings above our guidance. Our top games and live services, including EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, The Sims 4, are engaging players around the world with fresh new experiences. We see continued strength in our mobile titles with new games coming later this year. EA is executing well against our plans for FY '16. And with ongoing strength in our digital business and growing anticipation for our upcoming titles, we are raising our full-year guidance today to reflect momentum across the portfolio. 
Our industry is hitting a powerful stride as we advance further into the new global era for games. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 installed base continues to grow and show great strength, driving well beyond adoption rates of previous generation devices. 
The opportunities in mobile as well as new service and delivery models are opening more ways to bring players into our games than ever before. At the E3 conference in Germany, the appetite for great new games was clear. Players on all platforms are ready for new experiences that capture their imagination with creativity, innovation and breakthrough gameplay. 
EA is in a strong position to deliver. We had an outstanding E3 this year, showcasing 15 new games to our players, media and partners. Throughout the event, our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm was in full view. Star Wars Battlefront stunned audiences with the magnitude and realism of its gameplay. We revealed a new expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic and announced a new Star Wars mobile game. We unveiled new expenses for original IP with Mass Effect: Andromeda, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 and surprised with the unexpected charm of Unravel. 
We celebrated the return of Need for Speed, captivated players with the authenticity of our upcoming sports games and detailed the gameplay innovation in Mirror's Edge Catalyst. Attendees were able to go hands-on with all of this year's titles at our E3 booth. 
Most importantly, through content and social conversation, we brought the E3 experience to players around the world. Millions of viewers joined the stream of our live event, and our titles were mentioned more than 500 times per minute on social media during the week of E3. Trailers, gameplay and live streams of our games were viewed over 53 million times throughout E3. And Star Wars Battlefront alone generated 22 million views on social platforms, our most popular content ever at E3. It was tremendous to see such positive reaction from players and feel the excitement level for our games continuing to build. 
We're looking forward to sharing more at Gamescom in just a few days. 
In addition to our upcoming games, our live service today are ecosystems of ever-changing content for our players. Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players logged a combined 170 million online gameplay hours in Q1, and we'll be bringing new expansion packs with both experiences in the coming months. 
The Sims 4 player community continues to grow and engage deeply with the game as we deliver more updates and new content. And we saw gameplay hours in our mobile hit, The Sims FreePlay increase 85% year-over-year. 
In addition, our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team modes averaged over 2 million players per day in Q1, up nearly 20% year-over-year. Amazing and creative new experiences, dynamic live services and deeply-engaged communities built on strong and meaningful relationships with our players, these are the building blocks of our long-term strategy for Electronic Arts. 
Through our key franchises as well as experiences with new and original IP, we have the ability to reach more players than ever. EA Access, Origin and our new Xfinity Games beta are bringing more players in to compete, connect and fuel their passion for games. 
And with our digital infrastructure, analytics and live services, we are evolving and personalizing the experience for each player, and exploring how cross-game services can create additional value for everyone. 
After a strong first quarter, the stage is now set for us to deliver a slate of groundbreaking and stunning new games through the remainder of FY '16. 
I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."

EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than prior years because we had no console title launches this quarter, and the year-ago quarter incl",1192,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than prior years because we had no console title launches this quarter, and the year-ago quarter included the launches of Titanfall for Xbox 360, EA SPORTS FIFA World Cup 2014 and EA SPORTS UFC. 
Our core business was strong. And at constant currency, this quarter's revenue would would have been within 4% of last year's. 
As I discussed the results for the quarter, bear in mind that FX changes have had a dramatic impact on year-on-year comparisons. The euro, for example, fell nearly 20% against the dollar from the first quarter last year to this year's first quarter. 
In the first quarter, EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline and The Sims 4 drove solid revenue and delivered excellent margins. This demonstrates the power of our deep catalog of popular IP, which delivers a base of stable revenue throughout the year. The revenue and margin beats versus guidance were driven by better-than-expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 10% year-over-year to $532 million, 77% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 20% to $2.28 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $255 million, up 21% over the prior year. The principal driver of this growth was FIFA Online 3 in China. $31 million of the FIFA Online 3 revenue was deferred from previous quarters, as noted in our last earnings call. 
Total Ultimate Team was down 6% year-on-year, but up 3% on a constant-currency basis, even with the World Cup boosting FIFA Ultimate Team engagement levels last year. 
Mobile generated $122 million in the quarter. Digital extra content and advertising was up 11% versus the prior year to $115 million, while premium mobile full game download revenue was just $7 million, down 56% compared to the prior year. 
We expect premium full game download revenue to remain at this minimal level for the foreseeable future. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $84 million of revenue, up 18% over the prior year. We continue to see the digital downloads increase as a percentage of full game sales, although this quarter was particularly high since our catalog titles typically skew more towards digital download than do newly launched games. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $71 million, down 11% from last year due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to The Vault. 
Titanfall is now in The Vault, and Dragon Age: Inquisition will join us at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.8%, an increase from last year's 70.2% and better than our guidance of 74.5%. 
Growth over the prior year was driven by product mix, the shift to digital and FIFA Online 3 in China. We exceeded guidance largely through better-than-expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and the continued success of The Sims 4, which delivers very high margins by virtue of being a PC title based on wholly-owned IP. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $472 million, up $13 million or 3% year-on-year. The increase over last year was driven by R&D, payroll tax expenses related to stock-based compensation, which have risen with the stock price, and by the extra week in the quarter. This was offset by FX and lower marketing costs as a result of no major launches this quarter. 
The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 per share, which is $0.15 better than guidance due to strong revenue and higher gross margin. 
As a reminder, this is calculated at our new tax rate of 22%. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.88 billion or approximately $9.23 per share. 64% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. 
Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $71 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $992 million, a record for this period. 
During Q1, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $132 million. Our $1 billion stock buyback program was initiated partway through Q1 in May 2015 and has a 2-year timeframe. As of the end of the first quarter, there was $925 million left on the $1 billion plan, as some of the stock repurchased during the quarter was bought under the old plan. Due to the strength of our business, we are increasing our full year guidance. 
For fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue is up by $50 million to $4.45 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS increases $0.10 to $2.85 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of 27%. 
It's still early in the year. And with Q1 representing less than 16% of expected full year revenues, we believe some continued conservatism is appropriate. 
The GAAP guidance becomes $4.3 billion in revenue and $1.98 of fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the year, we are reiterating our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.15 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.05 billion. 
Guidance for our second quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. 
In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. 
In addition, FX presents a year-on-year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 63%. Again, the main difference between this quarter an the year-ago quarter is the launch of The Sims 4. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $510 million, up slightly year-on-year, driven by an increased investment in R&D and offset by FX and savings in marketing. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.73 per share last year. 
Our Q2 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $815 million as compared to $990 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $0.58 as compared to $0.01 per share profit in the prior year. 
We're very pleased with our first quarter results. Our ability to reliably generate earnings even in the absence of major launches is a testament to the value of our broad IP portfolio, our catalog and our robust live services. 
Digital extra content and mobile continue to provide additional layers of consistent revenue. On top of this, player reactions to our marquee titles at E3 gives us great confidence in our competitive position as we look forward into this year and beyond. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew"

Need for Speed will arrive in November, and fans are loving the authentic car culture and deep customization that we've shown so far. And of course, Star Wars Battlefront will launch on November 17. The excitement for this game continues to build. It took home 45 awards from E3, including Game of the Show from IGN and Best Online Multiplayer from the E3 Game Critics. We look forward to unveiling new dimensions of Star Wars Battlefront and letting players go hands-on next week at Gamescom. 
We have more new experiences coming throughout the year. Our live services will continue to evolve with new content, we'll have some great new mobile games and we're excited to have 3 new and original IP titles launching in Q4. 
Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect: Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY '17 and another new Star Wars project being led by the dynamic creative team of Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig. 
These are just a few of the new experiences in development across our studios today. 
From the creativity of our teams, to the technologies we are building, to the passion for play that we share with our players, we are pushing the boundaries for games in an effort to deliver the next amazing experience. Through our games and lives services, we will immerse players in new worlds, introducing engaging new characters, and transport them into adventures that capture the imagination.

I think, Blake, you touched on some of this, but it's a very impressive margin that you've posted in. I'm just hoping if you could provide a little bit more detail on what, in particular, drove that through a combination of, I guess, digital downloads, FIFA Online in China and then whatever else? And then just secondly, in terms of Ultimate Team, I think you've commented that it was up slightly on a constant-currency basis, but down on a reported basis. I know last quarter, there was an illegal coin sell issue, and I know you're working to resolve that. So just curious where you stand as it relates to that.

One, last year, both Titanfall and UFC are royalty-bearing titles. So they have dampened last year's gross margin a little bit. But the real driver for us was the strength, as you noted, FIFA Online 3. Obviously some of that's deferred revenues, so coming in at very nice gross margins. But second, and probably more importantly, the strength of The Sims 4. And I just give people a reminder, last year, The Sims started a little slow relative to our thinking. We talked about that in our Q2 earnings. But the strength of The Sims franchise is the layering in of expansion packs that really fuel not just the expansion pack revenue, but bring people into the core game. And we were in a situation where many consumers were comparing the original Sims 4 game to the Sims 3 game with a long series of expansion packs. And as we now start to bring out expansion packs, they're starting to see the power of The Sims 4 gameplay and the excitement around it. And we sold more Sims 4 this quarter than we thought. And we think that trend will continue, and we're very excited about it not just because of the franchise, but because of the power that it drives to the gross margins. And then last, but not least, as you saw the digital business as a whole was 77% of our total revenue, and that included a large amount of full game downloads, which obviously enhances margin as well as all the other components of the digital business, which enhanced our gross margin. And that really helped the over delivery relative to plan. Now in terms of FIFA Ultimate Team, and I encourage Peter or Andrew to jump in on this if they like, first, we saw, as you said, Ultimate Team down slightly, but up on a constant-currency basis. And a key reminder there is the comparison year-over-year was that FIFA Ultimate Team did extremely well in the first quarter of last year because of the World Cup and all of the people playing associated with the World Cup and the World Cup modes that we have in the game. We did see better performance of FIFA Ultimate Team than we expected. If you remember, in Q1, we -- our last call, before Q4, excuse me, we gave some warning that because the illegitimate coin selling, we thought that we would see some slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team mainly because the actions we take can due to price standing. Much of that will be corrected in the new version of FIFA Ultimate Team that comes out with FIFA 16, and we're excited about that. And we don't see any change to our outlook for the overall extra content in the Ultimate Team business in the future. And as you can see, we were surprised that we did better than expected on Ultimate Team in the quarter, which also helped drive margins. There's a lot of excitement about soccer in the world. The Women's World Cup in Canada really drove a huge amount of excitement in North America.

OpEx, the OpEx that we give guidance on at the start of the year obviously hasn't changed in terms of the guidance. We have built into that OpEx R&D investments in both console and mobile products, and that's why you're seeing a slight uptick. The OpEx this quarter was driven primarily by the options -- or RSU exercises and the tax expenses associated with those. We didn't forecast the stock price to be as high as it turned out to be. And thus, it was a little bit higher than we'd expected. Still obviously within our guidance, and we're comfortable with our full year guidance on OpEx. We're continuing to try to be extremely efficient in R&D and continue to try to build benefits in to drive marketing expenses around the great digital connection we have with our users, our gamers and consumers out there. You'll hopefully see continued benefits of that over time. In terms of the guidance in products, Unravel was in the original guidance. I don't think the expectations around the love for Yarny himself was quite built into our guidance, and we were pleasantly surprised at E3 about how popular he was. But it's still a fairly small product than is built into our guidance. We haven't added any products to our guidance. That was not the reason that we raised the number. The number was raised primarily due to the positive reception we saw across all of our products, and the strength of the industry, as Andrew mentioned, the excitement we've seen around console gaming and the continued popularity of both Xbox and PlayStation and the strength of that going forward. So that was really the driver to our raised guidance."

This is the first time we've raised guidance in probably 10 or 15 years coming out of the first quarter because only 16% of our business is really booked in the first quarter. We're really excited about Battlefront, but we're also really excited about all of our products. And that excitement drove us to increase our guidance in the quarter. We haven't yet started to think about or talk about publicly what that means in terms of units, partially because it's still early. We want to see how the reaction at the Gamescon to all our price, including Battlefront, as well as how the fall plays out. So I would assume we'll have that discussion in October before we ship those products, and more to come on that.

The same FX impact, $250 million, that's the $4.45 billion in adjusted post-FX revenue. And we presented in our investor pack the FX rate. The reality is the euro's right about the same level as it was when we did our original guidance.

Right now, we have a number of different incubation projects across the company, where we're looking at best-in-class, new and innovative and creative ways for players to experience our games in a virtuality environment. Still very early days, but we feel we are investing appropriately to prepare for a time where that could provide a new and different and innovative way for our players to experience our games."

And we want to try to do the same thing with Tencent in China to really drive that business versus throw a lot of products into the market and hope something works.

And do we build that into a consistent and predictable engagement loop for our players and of our business? And I think what you're seeing with FIFA and our other properties, including Battlefield and Madden and NHL and others, is that we are successfully navigating that shift and really leading from the front in an industry to drive great engagement opportunities for our players. The second vector, as we think about that, is then what's the appropriate business model for any given player to enjoy that experience? And I think it's insightful that you've point out that it does open up subscription opportunity. As it relates to subscription right now, we are very happy with the testing and experimentation and analysis we've got going on with EA Access.

China, as we know, is a very interesting, diverse and dynamic marketplace, particularly for Western companies.

We'd have to think about business model. We'd have to think about appropriate culturalized content and the ability to fulfill the motivations that they have for social connection and competition, which differs from how we play in the West or even in other Asian markets.

And then the upside component of that obviously settled in stock. Right now, at the average stock price for the quarter, which was $61.61, that would equal 6.6 million shares of stock that would be used to obviously settle the convert. We published a chart on our website, our IR website, that shows that at various stock levels. So I would consult that and note there's a difference between the GAAP share count and the non-GAAP share count because GAAP accounting excludes the benefit of the bond hedge. So it shows the full dilution versus what comes in through the bond head, where the non-GAAP share count is obviously unaffected by it. A couple of notes. As many people see with converts, particularly ones that are well into money like ours, there often is early conversion requests that come in. And shortly after the last coupon payment, we saw a jump in early conversion requests. I believe people are simply making a calculation as do they take their money now or borrow money to carry it for the rest of the year. And typically, the borrowing cost is offset -- not fully offset by the coupon. And so you're seeing some early conversions. And we've had over $165 million of early conversions that will get paid out over the next 3 months. So it's a time lapse. And so our assumption is we'll continue to see some of that over the next year as people get closer to the conversion date next July. And our intention is to look through ways to obviously potentially refinance that in the capital structure. We've talked about a potential permanent layer of debt or another convert and/or just paying it all off. And we're looking through all those options and more to come. But we appreciate the fact that there will be a lot of dilution. And we're looking at ways to minimize that dilution going forward."

Q2 FY '16 was a strong quarter for Electronic Arts as we delivered new EA SPORTS experiences and dynamic live services for our players. Revenue margin and earnings were above our guidance, and we are raising our full year outlook to reflect continuing strength in our business and excitement for our upcoming titles, including Star Wars Battlefront. 
To understand how Electronic Arts is delivering for our players today, we look at player engagement in our games and services. We see our opportunity along 3 key vectors: bringing in more players to experience our games and services, enabling them to spend more time with our games -- with the games they love and making it possible to connect through more platforms and delivery models. 
Time is the most valuable commodity we have in today's digital world with every new game, every update in our live services and every community interaction, we are focused on delivering more value for our players through deep and personal engagement. Highlights from our second quarter demonstrate how more players are spending more time on more platforms in our games today. 
Monthly average players increased 30% year-over-year across our ad and will EA SPORTS franchises that launched new titles in Q2: Madden NFL 16, NHL 16 and FIFA 16. Our live services for Battlefield Hardline and Battlefield 4 are thriving many months after launch, with more than 6 million monthly average players across the 2 experiences. 
Madden NFL model launched a full game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year. 
And last but not least, EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last 2 quarters. We've added 5 new games to the vault this year and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through service. 
These titles and live services as well as many more in our portfolio are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season. Looking ahead, I'll be joined in Q3 by 2 of our most exciting and groundbreaking new experiences. First, the return of Need for Speed this year, with players able to join a trial via EA Access today and launching for everyone on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 beginning November 3. Excitement in the community has been growing as fans learn more about the cards, customization and unique storage in the game. The game looks fantastic and after close beta connected earlier in October, the Ghost Games team have been working directly with community feedback to deliver the experience our players want. With more than 70 different customization categories and twice the amount of road to rate as our previous games, the passion for speed and power culture will be at unleashed in the new Need for Speed. 
Starting in 19 days, that galaxy far far away will once again beat the center of our universe as Star Wars Battlefront launches around the world.

27963,308170630,886163,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, o",1375,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, on a constant currency basis, revenue would've been 3% greater than last year's, thanks to strong launches of our EA SPORTS titles led by FIFA 16 and Madden NFL 16 and associated Ultimate Team live services. As well as frontline success, we saw ongoing strength from our catalog, particularly The Sims 4 and Battlefield. 
In addition to our strong performance, this quarter's revenue includes a $30 million benefit from the recognition of some revenue from special editions of sports games sold in the quarter. It relates the Ultimate Team content included in these versions, we had originally forecast to recognize in Q3. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year to $408 million, 42% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 15% to a record $2.31 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. 
Extra content and freemium contributed $195 million, up 27% over the prior year. The principal driver of that growth was Ultimate Team across our sports franchises. In addition to the strength of t e live services, we benefited from an extra week of FIFA 16 sales in the quarter compared to last year. The new games modes we added to Madden NFL 16 and FIFA 16 are proving effective in deepening engagement. In addition, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title for China and Korea continues to perform well and its tracking to our expectation. 
Mobile generated $113 million in the quarter. The free download component was up 2% or 9% up [ph] the constant currency. During the quarter, we launched Need for Speed No Limits, EA SPORTS FIFA 16 Ultimate Team and a full game update of Madden NFL Mobile. Madden has been the top grossing -- top 5 grossing given the U.S. on the iPhone Apple App Store in October. 
These new titles, together with the just launched Minions Paradise, the upcoming Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and our existing live services will help continue to grow our mobile business. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $89 million of revenue, down 5% over the prior year, due in part to FX. As constant currency, this revenue would've increased as the growth in console downloads more than offset the absence of The Sims 4 this year. 
Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% for game downloads, with the exception of FIFA which skewed lower due to strong retail sales in Europe. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $83 million, down 9% from last year due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth. And finally, with regard to subscriptions, we launched a major expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic in Tuesday. Subscriptions are up 31% since the expansion was announced to their highest level since February 2014. We're optimistic about this continued performance in terms of both subscribers and free-to-play in relates to the first Star Wars movie in a decade. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 65.4%, a decrease from last year's 66.1% but above our guidance of 63%. Last year's Q2 gross margin was exceptionally strong due to The Sims 4. About 100 basis points of the margin outperformance this quarter was driven by the $30 million in high margin revenue mentioned earlier. A stronger-than-expected product and service mix also drive margins above our guidance. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $479 million, down $18 million year-on-year, driven by FX. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. At constant currency, OpEx would've been up approximately $16 million, chiefly driven by increased investment in R&D. 
The result in non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 per share, which is $0.25 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance, continued cost management and the revenue-facing earlier. At constant currency, EPS would've grown year -- over last year. 
Our cash and short-term investment at the end of the quarter were $2.59 billion or approximately $8.32 per share. 57% of this cash and short-term investment balances held onshore. This is down from 64% held onshore last quarter, the difference being driven by the redemptions of our convertible notes and stock repurchases. 
During Q2, we settled close to $200 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. And as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $95 million to settle in Q3. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares on a cost of $126 million, leaving $798 million in our 2-year, $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchase just keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $9 million. Operating cash flow was down $174 million from last year as a result of fewer launches in Q1 of this year compared to last and also to the timing -- due to the timing of various items. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $818 million. 
Turning to guidance. Due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're rising -- raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017. And remember that the $30 million in this quarter was already in our annual outlook as part of our anticipated Q3 revenue. 
Our new full year guidance for non-GAAP revenue is $4.5 billion, up $50 million on our prior outlook. Our guidance for non-GAAP EPS increased by $0.15 to $3 per share. We anticipate an operating margin of approximately 28%. Since the start of this fiscal year, we've raised our guidance by $100 million in revenue and by $0.25 on earnings. 
The GAAP guidance becomes $4.4 billion in revenue and $2.32 of fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.1 billion. 
Guidance for our third quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.78 billion, 24% higher than last year's. Growth is driven by the launches of Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed plus the growth of live services, particularly Ultimate game. FX presents a year-on-year headwind of around $110 million to Q3 revenues. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 71.5%. We expect our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $540 million, up slightly year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D and facing from Q2, offset by FX. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 per share as compared to $1.22 last year. Our Q3 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.08 billion as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be a loss of $0.17 as compared to earnings of $0.44 last year. 
Our business exceeded our expectations again this quarter. FIFA 16 in particular have a very successful launch as measured by number of units sales and by engagement level. This has provided a solid foundation upon which to grow our live services through the product cycle. Reception of the Star Wars Battlefront beta has led us to increase our unit forecast and early indications for Need for Speed are excellent. The growth of our console-installed base and powerful mobile devices continue to fuel the growth of our business. We're looking forward to an excellent holiday season and another year of strong earnings and cash flow growth. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

In terms of the longer-term target, we haven't really given detailed long-term targets. What we have told people is that if the continued on the same page of digital growth as we've seen over the last couple of years, we should be able to generate at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion each year. Historically, it succeeded that level. But I think at a minimum, we should be able to see that. If you combine that with control around our operating expenses and continued movement towards more digital marketing, we should be able to see earnings growth and our target is to try to get to earnings growth at least above 10% or greater closer to 50% on a year-to-date basis if we can. That's obviously general targets, we'll give you the detail guidance for our FY '17 at the end of the year. And to the extent we have an update on that, we'll let you know, but we're continuing to be excited obviously on where the business and the potential is. In terms of FIFA, the guidance for extra content and ultimately, the guidance for extra content that we originally gave for the full year was around 10% growth of extra content. We've been exceeding that and we hope that we would continue to hit that target or beat target over time. We're very excited about the continued engagement levels that people are showing in all of our sports titles around extra content as well as the potential for extra content in other places in our portfolio. As far as FIFA Online 3 goes, in China, we had originally given of guidance that, that should be around $10 million to $15 million a quarter and we're seeing that levels, and we're pretty comfortable that, that continues to grow over time."

But you should assume that a fairly large portion of the original sell-in comes to the third quarter and then depending on how that does through this Christmas season, we'll see the rest in the fourth quarter. So roughly, probably 75-25. In terms of full game download. A couple of things to remember, we still sell Gen3 products and Gen3 products are typically doing full game downloads at a much lower level. And then second, our business, particularly FIFA is skewed heavily towards Europe and 2 factors bring down full game downloads today in Europe. One is bandwidth speed in some countries; and two, is many retailers in Europe particularly in Great Britain used FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store and they like a physical copy to do that. We're seeing very strong full game downloads continue in North America. And as a reminder, the PC business that we have, we see full game downloads, they're roughly 75%. And so there's still a lot of headroom we believe in the full game downloads opportunity for us going forward."

So on the gross margin structure, I think we've told people that the license with Disney is a fairly typical royalty license and most of our royalty license, they're in high single digit to low double digits.

What we try to do is offset some of that cost by lowering our marketing expense and clearly leveraging the strength of all the activities out there around Star Wars is allowing us to do that. And you'll see a lot of joint marketing between us and Disney as well as us and Sony to try to leverage our partners to be able to offset some that. It will impact gross margins slightly as you've seen in our guidance for the quarter, but we don't see it as a big issue for an overall profitability to the company. On the full game download sites, the one caveat, I would add there is my many, it shouldn't be that would really defer dramatically from any other title with the one exception is it could be a title as a heavy-gifting title in the quarter just because Star Wars is a top list of many kids and teens out there what they want for Christmas. And so in gifting titles tend to be more physical versus a code, and so you might tend to see that. That could be the counterbalanced by the fact that we'll see in another 10 million to 15 million you consoles sold in the next 2 months in the Christmas time.

This is a global title. I've been traveling around the world recent and checking and all of our retail in digital channels in the global basis and we're fired up and ready to go. The movie feels like one of the true global launches when you start to speak with consumers around the road, the anticipation levels are high, which I don't think there's a direct correlation to how we would face our revenue from region to region. It's going to big and bigger."

Q2 FY '16 was a strong quarter for Electronic Arts as we delivered new EA SPORTS experiences and dynamic live services for our players. Revenue, margin and earnings were above our guidance, and we are raising our full year outlook to reflect continuing strength in our business and excitement for our upcoming titles, including Star Wars Battlefront.
To understand how Electronic Arts is delivering for our players today, we look at player engagement in our games and services. We see our opportunity along 3 key vectors: bringing in more players to experience our games and services, enabling them to spend more time with our games -- with the games they love and making it possible to connect through more platforms and delivery models.
Time is the most valuable commodity we have in today's digital world. With every new game, every update in our live services and every community interaction, we are focused on delivering more value for our players through deep and personal engagement. Highlights from our second quarter demonstrate how more players are spending more time on more platforms in our games today.
Monthly average players increased 30% year-over-year across our annual EA SPORTS franchises that launched new titles in Q2: Madden NFL 16, NHL 16 and FIFA 16. Our live services for Battlefield Hardline and Battlefield 4 are thriving many months after launch, with more than 6 million monthly average players across the 2 experiences.
Madden NFL mobile launched a full game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year.
And last but not least, EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last 2 quarters. We've added 5 new games to the vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through service.
These titles and live services as well as many more in our portfolio are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season. Looking ahead, they'll be joined in Q3 by 2 of our most exciting and groundbreaking new experiences. First, the return of Need for Speed this year, with players able to join a trial via EA Access today and launching for everyone on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 beginning November 3. Excitement in the community has been growing as fans learn more about the cars' customization and unique storage in the game. The game looks fantastic and after a close beta conducted earlier in October, the Ghost Games team has been working directly with community feedback to deliver the experience our players want. With more than 70 different customization categories and twice the amount of road to race as our previous game, the passion for speed and car culture will be unleashed in the new Need for Speed.
Starting in just 19 days, the galaxy far, far away will once again be at the center of our universe as Star Wars Battlefront launches around the world. Engagement in and around the record-breaking beta was huge, with more than 9.5 million players logging on to play, 19 million viewers tuning into video streams and almost 3 mention per second on social networks during the beta week.
Stability and scalability of our online services continues to be a core focus for us. In addition to our extensive internal testing, the millions of gameplay hours logs during the beta across multiplayer, single player and coop modes further tested our infrastructure to help prepare a stable experience for our players at launch and beyond.
Over the next few weeks, innovative new experiences will allow players to connect and learn more about Star Wars Battlefront. Our most average Star Wars Battlefront fans can sign up for free to receive exclusive content and advanced access to new information about the game. Through the largest-ever user-generated content program we've ever launched, awesome and inspiring moment from the game will be shared with millions in the player community, and a fully immersive web experience will put fans right in the world of Star Wars Battlefront. Through it all, our integration with the upcoming film will ensure we're fully connected to the rising passion for Star Wars that is captivating the world. Come join us in Star Wars Battlefront beginning November 17 or November 12 for EA Access members. 
As we continue our focus on putting players first in Electronic Arts, we strike the quality and innovation in every experience. In addition to stability, security and availability, we are taking creative leaps to make each game memorable and fun. We'll always work to take the necessary time to get the combination right for our players. And early this afternoon, we announced that we are shifting Mirror's Edge Catalyst release to May 24, 2016. We're going to take a few additional months to make the City of Glass and the unique first-person action in Mirror's Edge Catalyst even more spectacular. With players spending more time in our games and live services and 2 stunning new experiences launching this quarter, we're looking forward to the holiday season and the remainder of the fiscal year for Electronic Arts.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."
27963,308170630,886466,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, o",1386,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, on a constant currency basis, revenue would have been 3% greater than last year's, thanks to strong launches of our EA SPORTS titles led by FIFA 16 and Madden NFL 16 and from their associated Ultimate Team live services. As well as frontline success, we saw ongoing strength from our catalog, particularly, The Sims 4 and Battlefield.
In addition to our strong performance, this quarter's revenue includes a $30 million benefit from the recognition of some revenue from special editions of sports games sold in the quarter. It relates to some Ultimate Team content included in these versions we had originally forecast to recognize in Q3.
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year to $408 million, 42% from this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 15% to a record $2.31 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter.
Extra content and freemium contributed $195 million, up 27% over the prior year. The principal driver of that growth was Ultimate Team across our sports franchises. In addition to the strength of these live services, we benefited from an extra week of FIFA 16 sales in the quarter compared to last year. The new game modes we added to Madden NFL 16 and FIFA 16 are proving effective in deepening engagement. In addition, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title for China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.
Mobile generated $113 million in the quarter. The free download component was up 2% or 9% up at constant currency. During the quarter, we launched Need for Speed No Limits, EA SPORTS FIFA 16 Ultimate Team and a full game update of Madden NFL Mobile. Madden has been a top grossing -- a Top 5 grossing given the U.S. on the iPhone Apple App Store in October.
These new titles, together with the just-launched, Minions Paradise, the upcoming Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and our existing live services will help continue to grow our mobile business.
Full game PC and console downloads generated $89 million of revenue, down 5% over the prior year, due in part to FX. At constant currency, this revenue would have increased as the growth in console downloads more than offset the absence of The Sims 4 this year. Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full game downloads, with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower due to strong retail sales in Europe.
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $83 million, down 9% from last year due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth.
And finally, with regard to subscriptions, we launched a major expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic on Tuesday. Subscriptions are up 31% since the expansion was announced to their highest level since February 2014. We're optimistic about this continued performance in terms of both subscribers and free-to-play in the run up to the first new Star Wars movie in a decade.
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 65.4%, a decrease from last year's 66.1%, but above our guidance of 63%. Last year's Q2 gross margin was exceptionally strong due to The Sims 4. About 100 basis points of the margin outperformance this quarter was driven by the $30 million in high-margin revenue mentioned earlier. A stronger-than-expected product and service mix also drove margins above our guidance.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $479 million, down $18 million year-on-year, driven by FX. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. At constant currency, OpEx would have been up approximately $16 million, chiefly driven by increased investment in R&D.
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 per share, which is $0.25 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance, continued cost management and the revenue-phasing described earlier. At constant currency, EPS would have grown year -- over last year.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.59 billion or approximately $8.32 per share. 57% of the cash and short-term investment balances held onshore. This is down from 64% held onshore last quarter, the difference being driven by the redemptions of our convertible notes and stock repurchases.
During Q2, we settled close to $200 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. And as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $95 million to settle in Q3. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $798 million in our 2-year, $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $9 million. Operating cash flow was down $174 million from last year as a result of fewer launches in Q1 of this year compared to last and also to the timing -- due to the timing of various items. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $818 million.
Turning to guidance. Due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're rising our -- raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017. And remember that the $30 million of the -- in this quarter was already in our annual outlook as part of our anticipated Q3 revenue.
Our new full year guidance for non-GAAP revenue is $4.5 billion, up $50 million on our prior outlook. Our guidance for non-GAAP EPS increased by $0.15 to $3 per share. We anticipate an operating margin of approximately 28%. Since the start of this fiscal year, we've raised guidance by $100 million on revenue and by $0.25 on earnings. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.4 billion in revenue and $2.32 of fully diluted EPS.
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.1 billion.
Guidance for our third quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.78 billion, 24% higher than last year's. Growth is driven by the launches of Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed plus the growth of live services, particularly Ultimate Team. FX presents a year-on-year headwind of around $110 million to Q3 revenues.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 71.5%. We expect our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $540 million, up slightly year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D and phasing from Q2, offset by FX. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 per share as compared to $1.22 last year. Our Q3 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.08 billion as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be a loss of $0.17 as compared to earnings of $0.44 last year.
Our business exceeded our expectations again this quarter. FIFA 16, in particular, had a very successful launch as measured both by number of unit sales and by engagement level. This has provided a solid foundation upon which to grow our live services through the product cycle. Reception of the Star Wars Battlefront beta has led us to increase our unit forecast, and early indications for Need for Speed are excellent. The growth of our console installed base and powerful mobile devices continue to fuel the growth of our business. We're looking forward to an excellent holiday season and another year of strong earnings and cash flow growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

In terms of the longer-term target, we haven't really given detailed long-term targets. What we have told people is if the continue on the same pace of digital growth as we've seen over the last couple of years, we should be able to generate at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion each year. Historically, it's exceeded that level. But I think at a minimum, we should be able to see that. If you combine that with control around our operating expenses and continued movement towards more digital marketing, we should be able to see earnings growth, and our target is to try to get to earnings growth at least above 10% or greater, closer to 15% on a yearly basis if we can. That's obviously general targets. We'll give you detailed guidance for FY '17 at the end of the year. And to the extent that we have an update on that, we'll let you know. But we're continuing to be excited, obviously, about where the business and the potential is. In terms of FIFA, the guidance for extra content -- and Ultimate Team in general, the guidance for extra content that we originally gave for the full year was around 10% growth of extra content. We've been exceeding that and we hope that we can continue to hit that target or beat that target over time. And we're very excited about the continued engagement levels that people are showing in all of our sports titles around extra content, as well as the potential for extra content in other places in our portfolio. As far as FIFA Online 3 goes, in China, we had originally given guidance that, that should be around $10 million to $15 million a quarter and we're seeing that levels, and we're pretty comfortable as that continues to grow over time."

I don't have the number off the top of my head, but you should assume that a fairly large portion of the original sell-in comes to the third quarter and then depending on how that does through this Christmas season, we'll see the rest in the fourth quarter. So roughly, probably 75-25. In terms of the full game downloads, a couple of things to remember, we still sell Gen3 products. And Gen3 products are typically doing full game downloads at a much lower level. And then second, our business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily towards Europe and 2 factors bring down full game downloads today in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries; and two, is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store and they like a physical copy to help do that. We're seeing very strong full game downloads continue in North America. And as a reminder, the PC business that we have, we see full game downloads, they're roughly 75%. And so there's still a lot of headroom, we believe, in the full game download opportunity for us going forward."

To the second question around Star Wars and annualization. Again, what we have talked about is we have a long-term partnership around the Star Wars license, and we expect that we will launch many titles as part of that long-term relationship. In terms of annualizing that in any particular way, we've made no announcements on that. And certainly, what we're always looking at as we think across our portfolio is where there is an added opportunity for engagement. What we talked about in the prepared remarks is we still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. And it's important we think about our business not just as a launch business but as a live service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things. So more to come on that in the future, but certainly expect more Star Wars titles from us. But no decision made as to specific timing as yet."

So on the gross margin structure, I think we've told people that the license with Disney is a fairly typical royalty license and that most of our royalty licenses, they're in the high single digits or low double digits, and assume that this Disney license is there. What we try to do is offset some of that cost by lowering our marketing expense and clearly, leveraging the strength of all the activities out there around Star Wars is allowing us to do that. And you'll see a lot of joint marketing between us and Disney as well as us and Sony to try to leverage our partners to be able to offset some that. It will impact gross margins slightly as you've seen in our guidance for the quarter, but we don't see it as a big issue for the overall profitability to the company. On the full game download side, the one caveat I would add there is, normally, it shouldn't really differ dramatically from any other title, with the one exception is it could be a title, it's a heavy-gifting title in the quarter just because Star Wars is at the top list of many kids and teens out there what they want for Christmas. And so -- and gifting titles tend to be more physical versus a code, and so you might tend to see that. That could be though counterbalanced by the fact that we'll see another 10 million to 15 million new consoles sold in the next 2 months in the Christmas time, and many of this people may choose to download digitally, particularly if they're the larger-storage consoles.

Q2 FY '16 was a strong quarter for Electronic Arts as we delivered new EA SPORTS experiences and dynamic live services for our players. Revenue, margin and earnings were above our guidance, and we are raising our full year outlook to reflect continuing strength in our business and excitement for our upcoming titles, including Star Wars Battlefront.
To understand how Electronic Arts is delivering for our players today, we look at player engagement in our games and services. We see our opportunity along 3 key vectors: bringing in more players to experience our games and services, enabling them to spend more time with our games -- with the games they love and making it possible to connect through more platforms and delivery models.
Time is the most valuable commodity we have in today's digital world. With every new game, every update in our live services and every community interaction, we are focused on delivering more value for our players through deep and personal engagement. Highlights from our second quarter demonstrate how more players are spending more time on more platforms in our games today.
Monthly average players increased 30% year-over-year across our annual EA SPORTS franchises that launched new titles in Q2: Madden NFL 16, NHL 16 and FIFA 16. Our live services for Battlefield Hardline and Battlefield 4 are thriving many months after launch, with more than 6 million monthly average players across the 2 experiences.
Madden NFL mobile launched a full game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players, which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year.
And last but not least, EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last 2 quarters. We've added 5 new games to the vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through this service.
These titles and live services as well as many more in our portfolio are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season. Looking ahead, they'll be joined in Q3 by 2 of our most exciting and groundbreaking new experiences. First, the return of Need for Speed this year, with players able to join a trial via EA Access today and launching for everyone on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 beginning November 3. Excitement in the community has been growing as fans learn more about the cars' customization and unique storage in the game. The game looks fantastic and after a close beta conducted earlier in October, the Ghost Games team has been working directly with community feedback to deliver the experience our players want. With more than 70 different customization categories and twice the amount of road to race as our previous game, the passion for speed and car culture will be unleashed in the new Need for Speed.
Starting in just 19 days, the galaxy far, far away will once again be at the center of our universe as Star Wars Battlefront launches around the world. Engagement in and around the record-breaking beta was huge, with more than 9.5 million players logging on to play, 19 million viewers tuning into video streams and almost 3 mentions per second on social networks during the beta week.
Stability and scalability of our online services continues to be a core focus for us. In addition to our extensive internal testing, the millions of gameplay hours logs during the beta across multiplayer, single player and coop modes further tested our infrastructure to help prepare a stable experience for our players at launch and beyond.
Over the next few weeks, innovative new experiences will allow players to connect and learn more about Star Wars Battlefront. Our most average Star Wars Battlefront fans can sign up for free to receive exclusive content and advanced access to new information about the game. Through the largest-ever user-generated content program we've ever launched, awesome and inspiring moments from the game will be shared with millions in the player community, and a fully immersive web experience will put fans right in the world of Star Wars Battlefront. Through it all, our integration with the upcoming film will ensure we're fully connected to the rising passion for Star Wars that is captivating the world. Come join us in Star Wars Battlefront beginning November 17 or November 12 for EA Access members. 
As we continue our focus on putting players first in Electronic Arts, we strive for quality and innovation in every experience. In addition to stability, security and availability, we are taking creative leaps to make each game memorable and fun. We'll always work to take the necessary time to get the combination right for our players. And early this afternoon, we announced that we are shifting Mirror's Edge Catalyst release to May 24, 2016. We're going to take a few additional months to make the City of Glass and the unique first-person action in Mirror's Edge Catalyst even more spectacular. With players spending more time in our games and live services and 2 stunning new experiences launching this quarter, we're looking forward to the holiday season and the remainder of the fiscal year for Electronic Arts.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."
27963,308170630,886529,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, o",1386,"Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, on a constant currency basis, revenue would have been 3% greater than last year's, thanks to strong launches of our EA SPORTS titles led by FIFA 16 and Madden NFL 16 and from their associated Ultimate Team live services. As well as frontline success, we saw ongoing strength from our catalog, particularly, The Sims 4 and Battlefield.
In addition to our strong performance, this quarter's revenue includes a $30 million benefit from the recognition of some revenue from special editions of sports games sold in the quarter. It relates to Ultimate Team content included in these versions we had originally forecast to recognize in Q3.
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year to $408 million, 42% for this quarter revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 15% to a record $2.31 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter.
Extra content and freemium contributed $195 million, up 27% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team across our sports franchises. In addition to the strength of these live services, we benefited from an extra week of FIFA 16 sales in the quarter compared to last year. The new game modes we added to Madden NFL 16 and FIFA 16 are proving effective in deepening engagement. In addition, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title for China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.
Mobile generated $113 million in the quarter. The free download component was up 2% or 9% up at constant currency. During the quarter, we launched Need for Speed No Limits, EA SPORTS FIFA 16 Ultimate Team and a full game update of Madden NFL Mobile. Madden has been a top grossing -- a Top 5 grossing game in the U.S. on the iPhone Apple App Store in October.
These new titles, together with the just-launched, Minions Paradise, the upcoming Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and our existing live services will help continue to grow our mobile business.
Full game PC and console downloads generated $89 million of revenue, down 5% over the prior year, due in part to FX. At constant currency, this revenue would have increased as the growth in console downloads more than offset the absence of The Sims 4 this year. Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full game downloads, with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower due to strong retail sales in Europe.
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $83 million, down 9% from last year due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth.
And finally, with regard to subscriptions, we launched a major expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic on Tuesday. Subscriptions are up 31% since the expansion was announced to their highest level since February 2014. We're optimistic about this continued performance in terms of both subscribers and free-to-play in the run up to the first new Star Wars movie in a decade.
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 65.4%, a decrease from last year's 66.1%, but above our guidance of 63%. Last year's Q2 gross margin was exceptionally strong due to The Sims 4. About 100 basis points of the margin outperformance this quarter was driven by the $30 million in high-margin revenue mentioned earlier. A stronger-than-expected product and service mix also drove margins above our guidance.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $479 million, down $18 million year-on-year, driven by FX. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. At constant currency, OpEx would have been up approximately $16 million, chiefly driven by increased investment in R&D.
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 per share, which is $0.25 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance, continued cost management and the revenue-phasing described earlier. At constant currency, EPS would have grown year -- over last year.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.59 billion or approximately $8.32 per share. 57% of the cash and short-term investment balances held onshore. This is down from 64% held onshore last quarter, the difference being driven by the redemptions of our convertible notes and stock repurchases.
During Q2, we settled close to $200 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. And as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $95 million to settle in Q3. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $798 million in our 2-year, $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $9 million. Operating cash flow was down $174 million from last year as a result of fewer launches in Q1 of this year compared to last and also to the timing -- due to the timing of various items. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $818 million.
Turning to guidance. Due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're rising our -- raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017. And remember that the $30 million of the -- in this quarter was already in our annual outlook as part of our anticipated Q3 revenue.
Our new full year guidance for non-GAAP revenue is $4.5 billion, up $50 million on our prior outlook. Our guidance for non-GAAP EPS increased by $0.15 to $3 per share. We anticipate an operating margin of approximately 28%. Since the start of the fiscal year, we've raised guidance by $100 million on revenue and by $0.25 on earnings. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.4 billion in revenue and $2.32 of fully diluted EPS.
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.1 billion.
Guidance for our third quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.78 billion, 24% higher than last year's. Growth is driven by the launches of Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed plus the growth of live services, particularly Ultimate Team. FX presents a year-on-year headwind of around $110 million to Q3 revenues.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 71.5%. We expect our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $540 million, up slightly year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D and phasing from Q2, offset by FX. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 per share as compared to $1.22 last year. Our Q3 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.08 billion as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be a loss of $0.17 as compared to earnings of $0.44 last year.
Our business exceeded our expectations again this quarter. FIFA 16, in particular, had a very successful launch as measured both by number of unit sales and by engagement level. This has provided a solid foundation upon which to grow our live services through the product cycle. Reception of the Star Wars Battlefront beta has led us to increase our unit forecast, and early indications for Need for Speed are excellent. The growth of our console installed base and powerful mobile devices continue to fuel the growth of our business. We're looking forward to an excellent holiday season and another year of strong earnings and cash flow growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

So as that shift continues, can you just update us on what the long-term margin target for the business looks like just in terms of non-GAAP operating income? And then secondly, extra content sales growth reaccelerated really nicely in 2Q and I think you mentioned that the new launch of FIFA 16 and FIFA Online 3 were drivers there. So should we expect the momentum to continue there through year end and what are you implicitly including in your guidance just in terms of extra content for the full year?"

In terms of the longer-term target, we haven't really given detailed long-term targets. What we have told people is if we continue on the same pace of digital growth as we've seen over the last couple of years, we should be able to generate at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion each year. Historically, it's exceeded that level. But I think at a minimum, we should be able to see that. If you combine that with control around our operating expenses and continued movement towards more digital marketing, we should be able to see earnings growth, and our target is to try to get to earnings growth at least above 10% or greater, closer to 15% on a yearly basis if we can. That's obviously general targets. We'll give you detailed guidance for FY '17 at the end of the year. And to the extent that we have an update on that, we'll let you know. But we're continuing to be excited, obviously, about where the business and the potential is. In terms of FIFA, the guidance for extra content -- and Ultimate Team in general, the guidance for extra content that we originally gave for the full year was around 10% growth of extra content. We've been exceeding that and we hope that we can continue to hit that target or beat that target over time. And we're very excited about the continued engagement levels that people are showing in all of our sports titles around extra content, as well as the potential for extra content in other places in our portfolio. As far as FIFA Online 3 goes, in China, we had originally given guidance that, that should be around $10 million to $15 million a quarter and we're seeing that levels, and we're pretty comfortable as that continues to grow over time. Next question?"

Good questions. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but you should assume that a fairly large portion of the original sell-in comes in the third quarter and then depending on how that does through the Christmas season, we'll see the rest in the fourth quarter. So roughly, probably 75-25. In terms of the full game downloads, a couple of things to remember, we still sell Gen3 products. And Gen3 products are typically doing full game downloads at a much lower level. And then second, our business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily towards Europe and 2 factors bring down full game downloads today in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries; and two, is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store and they like a physical copy to help do that. We're seeing very strong full game downloads continue in North America. And as a reminder, the PC business that we have, we see full game downloads, they're roughly 75%. And so there's still a lot of headroom, we believe, in the full game download opportunity for us going forward."

And certainly, what we're always looking at as we think across our portfolio is where there is an added opportunity for engagement. What we talked about in the prepared remarks is we still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. And it's important as we think about our business not just as a launch business but as a live service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things.

So on the gross margin structure, we've told people that the license with Disney is a fairly typical royalty license and that most of our royalty licenses are in the high single digits or low double digits so -- and assume that the Disney license is there. What we try to do is offset some of that cost by lowering our marketing expense and clearly, leveraging the strength of all the activities out there around Star Wars is allowing us to do that. And you'll see a lot of joint marketing between us and Disney as well as us and Sony to try to leverage our partners to be able to offset some that. It will impact gross margins slightly as you've seen in our guidance for the quarter, but we don't see it as a big issue for the overall profitability to the company. On the full game download side, the one caveat I would add there is, normally, it shouldn't really differ dramatically from any other title, with the one exception is it could be a title as a heavy-gifting title in the quarter just because Star Wars is at the top of the list of many kids and teens out there what they want for Christmas. And so -- and gifting titles tend to be more physical versus a code, and so you might tend to see that. That could be though counterbalanced by the fact that we'll see another 10 million to 15 million new consoles sold in the next 2 months in the Christmas time, and many of those people may choose to download digitally, particularly if they're the larger-storage consoles.

Obviously, it's a dominant North American title relative to FIFA and so we tend to see higher full game downloads on Madden than we have with FIFA globally for the fact that I mentioned earlier. And so you're seeing north of 20% on Madden, obviously. And as the season goes on, we find that the initial purchasers are tend to be the people who line up at the retail stores at midnight with their football jerseys on. Obviously, that skews the early days of Madden. But by mid-season, we tend to see levels creeping up closer to 40% at least based on last year's data. We don’t have it yet this year but a strong focus on that. And the strength of Ultimate Team with Madden has been -- was very powerful last year and I think that draws more and more people into digital purchases as part of that ongoing gameplay."
