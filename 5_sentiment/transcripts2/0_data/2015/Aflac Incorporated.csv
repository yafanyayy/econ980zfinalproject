Before we start, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our fourth quarter release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results. 
Now I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and year, as well as our operations in Japan. I'll follow-up, and then we'll take your questions afterwards. Dan?"

Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac. I'm excited about the incredibly strong fourth quarter sales results in both the United States and",1181,"Thanks, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac. I'm excited about the incredibly strong fourth quarter sales results in both the United States and Japan, and on top of that, we finished the year at the high end of our expectations for operating earnings per share growth. 
Let me begin with some highlights related to the Japanese operations. Aflac Japan's impressive 28.5% increase in third sector sales in the final quarter of 2014 is particularly remarkable to me, considering the significant growth follows 2 years of excellent sales results in the fourth quarter. Sales of cancer insurance serves following the launch of the new Cancer DAYS product, which also included an exclusive product sold by Japan Post. Cancer insurance sales through all distribution outlets were up an outstanding 176% for the quarter. This dramatic increase in cancer insurance sales was critical to Aflac Japan reaching the high end of the 2% to 7% annual target. 
On the distribution side, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. Additionally, I consider our strategic alliance with Japan Post to be enormously advantageous. This alliance merges the broad consumer access of Japan Post with Japan Aflac's status of an industry leader of cancer insurance. Tremendous progress has been made in increasing the number of postal outlets that offer our cancer insurance to our customers. I would remind you that Japan Post has the largest distribution network in Japan. I believe Aflac Japan and Japan Post will continue to be mutually beneficial as we make cancer insurance available to more and more Japanese consumers. Our goal is to have a presence in all the outlets to our consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions. 
In Japan, I think about sales for a 12-month period from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014. For the 9 months of 2015, we project that 15% increase in third sector sales. When you add the 28% increase from the fourth quarter, we could be close to a 20% increase over the rolling 12-month period. Please note that this 12-month rolling period will be the biggest third sector increase in more than 10 years.
We are reviewing fourth quarter sales in the difficult comparisons that we'll experience in 2015. At this point, we believe sales for the fourth quarter could be down sharply, but, as always, we'll be working to find ways to minimize that decline. At the end of the second quarter, we will have more insight and will give you additional guidance for the fourth quarter.
Aflac Japan has also performed extremely well in the fourth quarter, with $454 million in new sales or a 14.1% increase, exceeding our expectations. The strong fourth quarter sales drove our total new sales to $1.4 billion, which is approximately a 1% increase, which also significantly exceeded our most recent sales expectations for the year. I believe the changes we made to our sales organization in the third quarter are showing promising results, but I'm not willing to say yet that the sales have turned around until I see the first half sales results in 2015. Saying that, I'm still encouraged and I believe we should be or have an increase of somewhere between 3% to 7%, with a target of 5%.
I also want to mention that we have a groundbreaking new marketing campaign that I mentioned that CNBC this morning. We're kicking it off at the GRAMMYs on Sunday. And on E! Entertainment channel, the preshow, the Aflac will be the first ever advertising icon to walk the red carpet. During the GRAMMYs, a new commercial will feature of the Aflac [indiscernible], but it will focus on one day pay, which highlights our new accelerated claims payments. One day pay is an industry first that allows us to process, approve and pay in just 1 day, which would be about 70% of our eligible clients. 
Through one day pay, we expect to pay more than 1 million clients in 2015. I hope you all get a chance to see the commercial and the campaign. I'm very excited about it, and I think it will set us apart in the industry business, thus increasing our sales. You can also go to our website and see more about it.
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top-of-mind with our shareholders, and that's capital deployment. I believe dividends are important component of the value we provide to investors. In 2014, our capital strength enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders in the fourth quarter for the 32nd consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend at the rate that's generally in line with the earnings per share growth before the impact in the end. Additionally, we believe that share repurchase should continue to be the largest components of our capital deployment. I'm very pleased that in 2015, we plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of shares, which exceeds the 2014 repurchase. As we've said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders, we still believe that repurchasing of our shares and growing the cash dividend are the most effective means, and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue.
Let me reiterate what I said in the press release last night. I am very pleased that we ended the year with our operating earnings per share at the high end of the 2014 estimates. And although the results creates a tougher comparison when we look at 2015, our objective remains to grow 2015 operating earnings per diluted share for foreign currency at that 2% to 7% range. Because overall financial markets are currently very challenging and interest rates are at significantly depressed levels, it's difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore, we will be very disciplined in selling first sector products in Japan, which will reduce cash flows to investments. 
I also remind you that the progression of this year's benefit ratios in both the United States and Japan, which have been seen favorable trends, can also have significant impact on our results. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objective, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. 
Just let me end by saying how proud I am of the how hard our people in both Japan and the United States have worked to pull off such phenomenal fourth quarter results. Everyone involved has been relentless and disciplined in their pursuit of excellence. I'm also pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. 
First and foremost, we are focused on protecting our policyholders and providing value to our investors. We are fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial projection to over 50 million people worldwide.  Now I'll the program back over to Robin. Robin?"

So we feel confident that that growth was not about a single channel, but about a broader environment, where Japanese consumers saw the need for our cancer product and the belief that will continue impact our 15% increase projected over the next 3 quarters. As Kriss mentioned, he is correct. Sequentially, the numbers will remain the same as the rate of growth that we believe will really drop off in the fourth quarter. That said, it's very difficult to tell this far out with all of the different things that we're monitoring, how that's going to go. But the outstanding fourth quarter that happened here in Japan happened due to concerted effort by our sales team. It capped off an incredible career for total [indiscernible] as our President, who has everyone on the line and ready to execute, and we're just going through a wonderful succession here at Aflac Japan, with Hiroshi Yamauchi coming on as the President, and I'd like to just let him make a quick comment before we turn it back over."

We did execute an agreement to retrocede 50% of the second tranche. You'll recall that the second tranche released about JPY 55 billion of FSA-based reserves, and that was executed on October 1 of last year. And so then we retroceded roughly half of that to actually our company that's domiciled in Columbia and South Carolina, CAIC, or Aflac Group. And it effectively serves as an offset to the cost that we incurred for the reinsurance. So we'll pick up about $8 million or about $0.01 a share in this year from the retrocession, which will reduce the cost of the second tranche, which was probably around $0.025 a share so annualized. As far as the extent to which we might do this going forward, as I indicated at the Analyst Meeting we conducted in Tokyo last September, we're working on a multi-year capital plan, we're building out the framework for that plan and should be able to discuss in more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But I'll tell you, we have been pleased with the reinsurance agreements we executed. It's effective -- it's an efficient and effective tool for us to use to release FSA-based capital, and we found that that the retrocession is also a tool that we can use to try and minimize some of the cost of that transaction. So those are things that we'll consider as we go forward and build out our plan."

And clearly, we're in recognition of the fact that the historically low interest rates environment is a headwind to us, both in new sales in Japan. We don't want to sell products that don't have appealing profit margins. And at today's yen-denominated interest rates, it's hard to get an appealing profit margins on a per sector sale. We have been doing some alternative investment strategies to mitigate that, and we'll continue to pursue those alternative investments strategies for the business we do sell. But the fact of the matter is that new sales will be a drag, first sector sales will be a drag a bit. The ability to invest current cash flows at attractive investment yields is a challenge. Eric and can talk about if appropriate. And then you get to the benefit side of things. We benefited from a decline in benefit ratios for a number of years now. And the way we do our earnings estimates, we take a look at where we are today. We tend not to anticipate any further improvement in a step to be conservative. We have experienced improvements, and therefore, we we've been able to be at the mid- to high end of earnings range for the last several years. In 2015, if we continue to get improvement, it will move us towards the higher end of the range, and if things stay the same, we will probably stay in the midpoint of the range. If things deteriorate a bit in terms of no additional improvement or some modest deterioration, things might move toward the low end of the range. But that's why we got a range. It's just a lot of moving parts, and we don't have a lot more insight --  we don't have total insights into that, so that's why we give a range."

So if you use kind of that guidance that was offered last night, a 15% [ph] growth for the first 3 quarters of the year and then sounds like you're basically expecting a similar absolute number of sales in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, I got through about 2% growth for the full year in the third sector sales, which historically is at the low end of the guidance range within 2014. So I'm I am sorry to be on what seems a good sales quarter at the end of the day. But that still, I guess, I'm kind of surprised that with the Japan Post, with the deal and/or partnership and what are the new cancer products out of the market that we would see more robust growth over the full year?"

We are taking a more comprehensive approach to doing capital management planning, including identifying potential uses of capital and discussing potential sources of capital. And we don't want to act precipitously in just doing reinsurance deals for the sake of doing reinsurance deals because we can free up some of the additional reserves that are available in Japan. We want to have identify better use for that capital to the extent, which is to repatriate some of those proceeds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., and subsequently, to Aflac Incorporated. There are uses for capital other than share repurchase, partly to make sure that we've got squared up on our tax cash flows in the U.S. and some other things like the position of the U.S. operation from a capital perspective. We've been forced in the U.S. operation to kind of pay the shareholders dividends for some time, and there's a modest imbalance if you just look at U.S. only versus Japan that we're trying to remediate. It's not a source of concern among ourselves or among the regulators. But it's something that we're trying to do some advance planning on. And there's certainly potential other uses for capital. So we're trying to do more comprehensive program and will have more to comment on most, likely at FIB in terms of the progress we're making in that regard. But I just want to emphasize, we're not going to do the insurance for the sake of doing insurance or because we can.

So the comparison for medical sales, in conjunction with the strong emphasis we had on launching of our new cancer plan, certainly put the emphasis on third sector products on the cancer plan itself for that particular quarter. The other comment I'd like to make is really about the discipline that we're holding in the first sector. Because of the record low interest rates we're seeing today, and the profit margins that have already been mentioned around certain products, we are certainly restraining the total number, the total volume of first sector sales given the current conditions. Given the large volume of exclusive agencies we have at Aflac, we were certainly going to continue some presence, I would then say, first sector products. But in terms of broadly going after the first sector in the current environment, we're restraining those sectors and we're looking to see a fairly significant decline in first sector sales in 2015 if these trends continue. I will be closely monitoring, this is what we did in the fourth quarter, and we'll be monitoring our sales if conditions change for the better, we'll move in that direction. If conditions stay the same, or worsen, we would react accordingly. But we have measures in place to affect our sales based on the type of business we want to be selling at Aflac."

Though I should also say as we think about the U.S. dollar allocation, it's n",634,"Sure. It's Eric, Ryan. Prior to all this volatility, as we do our budgets and planning consistent with the SSA work that we completed, it would have been about a 25%, 75% ratio. Though I should also say as we think about the U.S. dollar allocation, it's not necessarily confined to U.S. corporates anymore. We've certainly have widen the scope. But you can call it a dollar assets. However, as you know, we're being very tactical [indiscernible] have dropped particularly in Japan because in the U.S., while Treasuries have fallen, we have seen some credit spreads widening that somewhat offset that. So the absolute yield levels haven't really dropped that much in the U.S. But in light of these very low yields, as you know, on the 10 years, is it 23 or 24, popped up, the 10-year JGB has popped up to about 38. At these low yields, we would be inclined to under weigh that allocation to JGB, meaning to buy a 20 or 30-year maturity at JGB, which is typically where we  focus at an average of perhaps 1% or so, we'd rather under way that allocation this year, those low yields and put that money to use whether in dollar assets, in traditional fixed income or perhaps we do expect this year to get going with some of the growth assets that I just spoken about. So we're going to monitor that closely. As you guys know, the global macro conditions are changing drastically. We're cognizant of that. But those low levels for JGB's would underweight our allocation relative to the original budget. The other thing I might mention as well as we continue to evolve in our transformation, we are being tactical on our asset allocation. So as an example, because we've seen a dislocation in the credit market going back to about November, December, we firmly believe there's good fundamental credits are still very strong in the U.S. So one of the things that we did late December, and we're completing up soon is what we call a $1 billion asset allocation or switch trades. So we've moved out of about $1 billion of our investment grade corporate that we own, and reallocated that about half to bank loans. We think that sector has gotten hit for technical, not necessarily for credit quality and liquidity for the retail market. But given our long-term nature, we can take advantage of that. And the other half of that into BB credits in the high yield sector, but the higher quality part of the high yields, where we think on a relative value basis, that's  a good long-term place to put our money. So we're not only focused on the new money that's coming in, and Kriss has talked about, there will be less cash flows this year that's associated with how we do the product side. But we're also looking internal to our portfolio. What else can we do amongst our own assets to rotate, to take advantage of this, and everyone's heard me say we're in a great position around our capital levels. As you all know, we've cleaned up the path in terms of the portfolio. So we are positioned for when there are disruptions in the market, if their asset classes and strategies that affect our FSA, we'll try to take advantage of those. And of course, all of those things I just mentioned are always within the risk one. So we have the risk one that's around all of these asset classes, we have different credit quality and duration, and we've capacity because we were derisking the portfolio over the last few years. So now is the time for us when these disruptions occur to take advantage of those risk limits and average into the markets."

And we take a look at the credit quality issue, and to your point, the JGBs we own, we'll be looking at it as a category instead of the AA category given by Moody's downgrade. But having said that, keep in mind we are balancing a number of factors. So for example, when we look at the JGB, they do provide us with yen interest rate protection versus our liabilities. So all of those liabilities are all in yen. So that's a very important factor that we look at the FSA, our JGB allocation is what I would call at the lower end of the range. It could a lot higher if we wanted even better matching characteristics, but the private health with that as well because they are yen-denominated. So we will take a look at that but I don't think there's an infinite amount the capacity to say JGB is down by 10% of the total portfolio in reallocate. There may be some opportunities around the edges. And then finally, just for clarification, most of our JGBs are either HDM or what we call PRM, policy reserve matching. We have [indiscernible] AFS.

Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac. I'm excited about the incredibly strong fourth quarter sales results in both the United States and",1187,"Thanks, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac. I'm excited about the incredibly strong fourth quarter sales results in both the United States and Japan. And on top of that, we finished the year at the high end of our expectations for operating earnings per share growth.
Let me begin with some highlights related to the Japanese operations. Aflac Japan's impressive 28.5% increase in third sector sales in the fourth -- in the final quarter of 2014 is particularly remarkable to me, considering the significant growth follows 2 years of excellent sales results in the fourth quarter. Sales of cancer insurance serves following the launch of the new Cancer DAYS product, which also included an exclusive product sold by Japan Post. Cancer insurance sales through all distribution outlets were up an outstanding 176% for the quarter. This dramatic increase in cancer insurance sales was critical to Aflac Japan reaching the high end of the 2% to 7% annual target. 
On the distribution side, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. Additionally, I consider our strategic alliance with Japan Post to be enormously advantageous. This alliance merges the broad consumer access of Japan Post with Japan Aflac's status of an industry leader of cancer insurance. Tremendous progress has been made in increasing the number of postal outlets that offer our cancer insurance to our customers. I would remind you that Japan Post has the largest distribution network in Japan. I believe Aflac Japan and Japan Post will continue to be mutually beneficial as we make cancer insurance available to more and more Japanese consumers. Our goal is to have a presence in all the outlets to our consumers who want to make their insurance purchase decisions. 
In Japan, I think about sales for a 12-month period from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015. For the 9 months of 2015, we project a 15% increase in third sector sales. When you add the 28% increase from the fourth quarter, we could be close to a 20% increase over the rolling 12-month period. Please note that this 12-month rolling period will be the biggest third sector increase in more than 10 years.
We are reviewing fourth quarter sales in the difficult comparisons that we'll experience in 2015. At this point, we believe sales for the fourth quarter could be down sharply but, as always, we'll be working to find ways to minimize that decline. At the end of the second quarter, we will have more insight and will give you additional guidance from the fourth quarter.
Aflac Japan has also performed extremely well in the fourth quarter, with $454 million in new sales or a 14.1% increase, exceeding our expectations. The strong fourth quarter sales drove our total new sales to $1.4 billion, which is approximately a 1% increase, which also significantly exceeded our most recent sales expectations for the year. I believe the changes we made to our sales organization in the third quarter are showing promising results, but I'm not willing to say yet that the sales have turned around until I see the first half sales results in 2015. Saying that, I'm still encouraged and I believe we should be or have an increase of somewhere between 3% to 7% with a target of 5%.
I also want to mention that we have a groundbreaking new marketing campaign that I mentioned on CNBC this morning. We're kicking it off at the GRAMMYs on Sunday. And on E! Entertainment channel, the preshow, the Aflac Duck will be the first-ever advertising icon to walk the red carpet. During the GRAMMYs, a new commercial will feature the Aflac Duck, but it will focus on One Day Pay, which highlights our new accelerated claims payments. One Day Pay is an industry first that allows us to process, approve and pay in just 1 day, which would be about 70% of our eligible claims. 
Through One Day Pay, we expect to pay more than 1 million clients in 2015. I hope you all get a chance to see the commercial and the campaign. I'm very excited about it and I think it will set us apart in the industry, thus increasing our sales. You can also go to our website and see more about it.
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top-of-mind with our shareholders, and that's capital deployment. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide to investors. In 2014, our capital strength enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders in the fourth quarter for the 32nd consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend at the rate that's generally in line with the earnings per share growth before the impact to the yen. Additionally, we believe that share repurchase should continue to be the largest component of our capital deployment. I'm very pleased that in 2015, we plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of shares, which exceeds the 2014 repurchase. As we've said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders, we still believe that repurchasing of our shares and growing the cash dividend are the most attractive means, and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue.
Let me reiterate what I said in the press release last night. I am very pleased that we ended the year with our operating earnings per share at the high end of the 2014 estimate. And although the results creates a tougher comparison when we look at 2015, our objective remains to grow 2015 operating earnings per diluted share before the currency at the 2% to 7% range. Because overall financial markets are currently very challenging and interest rates are at significantly depressed levels, it's difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore, we will be very disciplined in selling first sector products in Japan, which will reduce cash flows to investments. 
I also remind you that the progression of this year's benefit ratios in both the United States and Japan, which have seen favorable trends, could also have significant impact on our results. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. 
Just let me end by saying how proud I am of the -- how hard our people in both Japan and the United States have worked to pull off such phenomenal fourth quarter results. Everyone involved has been relentless and disciplined in their pursuit of excellence. I'm also pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world.

We are fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to over 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll the back -- program back over to Robin.

First of all, I'd like to say that Dan and Kriss are correct, that our channeled growth was across the board while Japan Post was significant and provided significant growth around our cancer plan. We also saw significant growth, not only in the corporate-affiliated agencies, but also with our independent agencies as well as our associates in all channels across the board. So we feel confident that, that growth was not about a single channel, but about a broader environment where Japanese consumers saw the need for our cancer product. We believe that will continue, thus our 15% increase projected over the next 3 quarters. As Kriss mentioned, he is correct. Sequentially, the numbers will remain the same as the rate of growth that we believe will really drop off in the fourth quarter. That said, it's very difficult to tell this far out with all of the different things that we're monitoring, how that's going to go. But the outstanding fourth quarter that happened here in Japan happened due to a concerted effort by our sales team.

We did execute an agreement to retrocede 50% of the second tranche. You'll recall that the second tranche released about JPY 55 billion of FSA-based reserves, and that was executed on October 1 of last year. And so then we retroceded roughly half of that to actually our company that's domiciled in Columbia and South Carolina, CAIC or Aflac Group. And it effectively serves as an offset to the cost that we incurred for the reinsurance. So we'll pick up about $8 million or about $0.01 a share in this year from the retrocession, which will reduce the cost of the second tranche, which was probably around $0.025 a share so annualized. As far as the extent to which we might do this going forward, as I indicated at the Analyst Meeting we conducted in Tokyo last September, we're working on a multiyear capital plan, we're building out the framework for that plan and should be able to discuss more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But I'll tell you, we have been pleased with the reinsurance agreements we've executed. It's an effective and -- efficient and effective tool for us to use to release FSA-based capital.

I'll say that I -- you've heard me say in prior years, there are a lot of moving parts to our earnings estimates. And clearly, we're in recognition of the fact that the historically low interest rate environment is a headwind to us, both in new sales in Japan. We don't want to sell products that don't have appealing profit margins. And at today's yen-denominated interest rates, it's hard to get an appealing profit margin on a per sector sale. We have been doing some alternative investment strategies to mitigate that, and we'll continue to pursue those alternative investments strategies for the business we do sell. But the fact to the matter is that new sales will be a drag, first sector sales will be a drag a bit, the ability to invest current cash flows at attractive investment yields is a challenge. Eric can talk about, if appropriate. And then you get to the benefit side of things. We benefited from a decline in benefit ratios for a number of years now. And the way we do our earnings estimates, we take a look at where we are today. We tend not to anticipate any further improvement in a step to be conservative. We have experienced improvements and, therefore, we've been able to be at the mid- to high end of the earnings range for the last several years. In 2015, if we continue to get improvement, it will move us toward the higher end of the range. If things stay about the same, it will probably stay in the mid part of the range. If things deteriorate a bit in terms of no additional improvement or some modest deterioration, things might move toward the low end of the range. But that's why we got a range. It's just a lot of moving parts, and we don't have a lot more insight --  well, we don't have total insight into that, so that's why we give a range."

That's about as far as our capacity and interest in additional reinsurance, that's going to be dictated by our capital management planning. We are taking a more comprehensive approach to doing capital management planning, including identifying potential uses of capital and discussing potential sources of capital. And we don't want to act precipitously in just doing reinsurance deals for the sake of doing reinsurance deals, because we can free up some of the additional reserves that are available in Japan. We want to have and identify appropriate use for that capital to the extent, which is to repatriate some of those proceeds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. and subsequently to Aflac Incorporated. There are uses for capital other than share repurchase, partly to make sure that we've got squared up on our tax cash flows in the U.S. and some other things like the position of the U.S. operation from a capital perspective where we've -- we've been forcing the U.S. operation to kind of pay the shareholder dividends for some time, and there's a modest imbalance if you just look at U.S. only versus Japan that we're trying to remediate. It's not a source of concern among ourselves or among the regulators, but it's something we're trying to do some advance planning on. And there are certainly potential other uses for capital, so we're trying to do a more comprehensive program. And we'll have more to comment on, most likely at FAB, in terms of the progress we're making in that regard. But I just want to emphasize, we're not going to do reinsurance for the sake of doing reinsurance or because we can. We have to have a disciplined approach about this, and that's what I'm trying to put in place."

So the comparison for medical sales in conjunction with the strong emphasis we had on launching of our new cancer plan, certainly put the emphasis on third sector products on the cancer plan itself for that particular quarter. The other comment I'd like to make is really about the discipline that we're holding in first sector. Because of the record low interest rates we're seeing today and the profit margins that have already been mentioned around certain products, we are certainly restraining the total number and total volume of first sector sales given the current conditions. Given the large volume of exclusive agencies we have at Aflac, we are certainly going to continue some presence within selling first sector products. But in terms of broadly going after the first sector in the current environment, we're restraining those sales and looking to see a fairly significant decline in first sector sales in 2015 if these trends continue. I will be closely monitoring, just as we did in the fourth quarter, and we'll be monitoring our sales. If conditions change for the better, we'll move in that direction. If conditions stay the same or worsen, we would react accordingly. But we have measures in place to affect our sales based on the type of business we want to be selling at Aflac."

Prior to all this volatility, as we do our budgets and planning and consistent with the SAA work that we've completed, it would have been about a 25%, 75% ratio. Though I should also say, as we think about the U.S. dollar allocation, it's not necessarily confined to U.S. corporates anymore. We've certainly have widen the scope, but we could call it dollar assets. However, as you know, we're being very tactical. Rates have dropped, particularly in Japan. Because in the U.S., while treasuries have fallen, we have seen some credit spread widening that somewhat offset that. So the absolute yield levels haven't really dropped that much in the U.S. But in light of these very low yields, as you know, on the 10 year, it's hit about 23 or 24. But since it popped up, the 10-year JGB has popped up to about 38. At these low yields, we would be inclined to underweight that allocation to JGBs. Meaning, to buy a 20- or 30-year maturity JGB, which is typically where we focus at an average of perhaps 1% or so, we'd rather underweight that allocation this year, those low yields, and put that money to use, whether in dollar assets, in traditional fixed income, or perhaps we do expect this year to get going with some of the growth assets that I just spoken about. So we're going to monitor that closely. As you guys know, the global macro conditions are changing drastically. We're cognizant of that. But those low levels for JGBs who would underweight our allocation relative to the original budget. The other thing I might mention as well, as we continue to evolve in our transformation, we are being tactical on our asset allocation. So as an example, because we've seen this dislocation in the credit market going back to about November, December, we firmly believe those good fundamental credits are still very strong in the U.S. So one of the things that we did late December, and we're completing up soon, is what we call a $1 billion asset allocation or switch trades. So we've moved out of about $1 billion of our investment grade corporates that we own, and reallocated that about half to bank loans. We think that sector has gotten hit from technicals, not necessarily for credit quality and liquidity from the retail market. But given our long-term nature, we can take advantage of that and the other half of that into BB credits in the high yield sector. But the higher quality part of high yields, where we think on a relative value basis, that's a good long-term place to put our money. So we're not only focused on the new money that's coming in. And Kriss has talked about there will be less cash flows this year that's associated with how we do the product side, but we're also looking internal to our portfolio, what else can we do amongst our own assets to rotate, to take advantage of this. And everyone's heard me say we're in a great position around our capital levels. As you all know, we've cleaned up the past in terms of the portfolio. So we are positioned for when there are disruptions in the market, if there are asset classes and strategies that fit our SAA, we'll seek to try to take advantage of those. And of course, all of those things I've just mentioned are always within the risk limits. We have risk limits around all of these asset classes, around different credit quality and duration. And we've had capacity because we were derisking the portfolio over the last few years. So now is the time for us when these disruptions occur to take advantage of those risk limits and average into the markets."

But I think what Mike Tomlinson, our new Director of Sales, is doing, is working, I think what Teresa is doing and her involvement with sales in terms of managing the people, has been good. I'm just, overall, very pleased. I think Dan Lebish and what he's done with Aflac Group has been good. So it all seems to be working. The one thing I will say about this new structure is it pays for performance, so there are going to be some very good bonuses in the fourth quarter. If they don't perform well, they're all going make a lot less in '15. So I've always said, put the money where you want it and the people will flow that way. I was in sales for 10 years, so I know that to be true. So I'm cautiously optimistic. But I want to wait till the end of the second quarter before I'm willing to declare victory on what's going on. Because frankly, we were going against a pretty easy quarter. The fourth quarter was an easy comparison for us, so we should have done well. Now we did better than I even thought. But still, it was an easy quarter. Our easiest quarter in 2015 will be the second quarter. First quarter is a little harder because we had some carryover business in '13, so we'll just have to see. But I'm still very encouraged that they will make that number. And I'm really not satisfied with that, I really want higher numbers. And I think, especially with this One Day Pay, it just opens the door for us, because there's nobody in the industry that's going to be able to process, approve and pay in one day. And that's what's important. It's at the time of claim that people need their money the fastest, and we're going to get it in their hands. And yes, there'll be some we can't because of like short-term disability. But the accident, the cancer, all the named product lines we sell, we're going to be able to get it to them. And I just think it's going to set us apart, and so I'm optimistic. But I still, at the same time, want to be cautious, because I am a salesman at heart, so I want to be careful here."

There could be a day when we prefer dollars to yen and we take a look at the credit quality issue. And to your point, the JGBs we own, we'll be looking at it in the single A category instead of the AA category, given the Moody's downgrade. But having said that, keep in mind, we are balancing a number of factors. So for example, when we look at the JGB, they do provide us with yen interest rate protection versus our liabilities, so that the liabilities are all in yen. So that's a very important factor. And we look at the SAA, our JGB allocation is what I would call at the lower end of the range. It could be a lot higher if we wanted even better matching characteristics that the privates help with that as well, because they are yen-denominated. So we will take a look at that, but I don't think there's an infinite amount of capacity to say take JGB is down by 10% of the total portfolio and reallocate. There may be some opportunities around the edges. And then, finally, just for clarification, most of our JGBs are in either HTM or what we call PRM, policy reserve matching. We have very few in AFS. But even within TRM, there are some opportunities to do asset allocation and rotate, but I just want to clarify the accounting designation."

Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac.

Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac. I'm excited about the incredibly strong fourth quarter sales results in both the United States and Japan. And on top of that, we finished the year at the high end of our expectations for operating earnings per share growth.
Let me begin with some highlights related to the Japanese operations. Aflac Japan's impressive 28.5% increase in third sector sales in the fourth -- in the final quarter of 2014 is particularly remarkable to me, considering the significant growth follows 2 years of excellent sales results in the fourth quarter. Sales of cancer insurance serves following the launch of the new Cancer DAYS product, which also included an exclusive product sold by Japan Post. Cancer insurance sales through all distribution outlets were up an outstanding 176% for the quarter. This dramatic increase in cancer insurance sales was critical to Aflac Japan reaching the high end of the 2% to 7% annual target. 
On the distribution side, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. Additionally, I consider our strategic alliance with Japan Post to be enormously advantageous. This alliance merges the broad consumer access of Japan Post with Japan Aflac's status of an industry leader of cancer insurance. Tremendous progress has been made in increasing the number of postal outlets that offer our cancer insurance to our customers. I would remind you that Japan Post has the largest distribution network in Japan. I believe Aflac Japan and Japan Post will continue to be mutually beneficial as we make cancer insurance available to more and more Japanese consumers. Our goal is to have a presence in all the outlets where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions. 
In Japan, I think about sales for a 12-month period from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015. For the 9 months of 2015, we project a 15% increase in third sector sales. When you add the 28% increase from the fourth quarter, we could be close to a 20% increase over the rolling 12-month period. Please note that this 12-month rolling period will be the biggest third sector increase in more than 10 years.
We are reviewing fourth quarter sales and the difficult comparisons that we'll experience in 2015. At this point, we believe sales for the fourth quarter could be down sharply but, as always, we'll be working to find ways to minimize that decline. At the end of the second quarter, we will have more insight and will give you additional guidance on the fourth quarter.
Aflac Japan has also performed extremely well in the fourth quarter, with $454 million in new sales or a 14.1% increase, exceeding our expectations. The strong fourth quarter sales drove our total new sales to $1.4 billion, which is approximately a 1% increase, which also significantly exceeded our most recent sales expectations for the year. I believe the changes we made to our sales organization in the third quarter are showing promising results, but I'm not willing to say yet that the sales have turned around until I see the first half sales results in 2015. Saying that, I'm still encouraged and I believe we should be or have an increase of somewhere between 3% to 7% with a target of 5%.
I also want to mention that we have a groundbreaking new marketing campaign that I mentioned on CNBC this morning. We're kicking it off at the GRAMMYs on Sunday. And on E! Entertainment channel, the preshow, the Aflac Duck will be the first-ever advertising icon to walk the red carpet. During the GRAMMYs, a new commercial will feature the Aflac Duck, but it will focus on One Day Pay, which highlights our new accelerated claims payments. One Day Pay is an industry first that allows us to process, approve and pay in just 1 day, which would be about 70% of our eligible claims. 
Through One Day Pay, we expect to pay more than 1 million claims in 2015. I hope you all get a chance to see the commercial and the campaign. I'm very excited about it and I think it will set us apart in the industry, thus increasing our sales. You can also go to our website and see more about it.
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top-of-mind with our shareholders, and that's capital deployment. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide to investors. In 2014, our capital strength enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders in the fourth quarter for the 32nd consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend at the rate that's generally in line with the earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. Additionally, we believe that share repurchase should continue to be the largest component of our capital deployment. I'm very pleased that in 2015, we plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of shares, which exceeds the 2014 repurchase. As we've said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders, we still believe that repurchasing of our shares and growing the cash dividend are the most attractive means, and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue.
Let me reiterate what I said in the press release last night. I am very pleased that we ended the year with our operating earnings per share at the high end of the 2014 estimate. And although the results creates a tougher comparison when we look at 2015, our objective remains to grow 2015 operating earnings per diluted share before the currency at the 2% to 7% range. Because overall financial markets are currently very challenging and interest rates are at significantly depressed levels, it's difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore, we will be very disciplined in selling first sector products in Japan, which will reduce cash flows to investments. 
I also remind you that the progression of this year's benefit ratios in both the United States and Japan, which have seen favorable trends, could also have significant impact on our results. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. 
Just let me end by saying how proud I am of the -- how hard our people in both Japan and the United States have worked to pull off such phenomenal fourth quarter results. Everyone involved has been relentless and disciplined in their pursuit of excellence. I'm also pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. 
First and foremost, we are focused on protecting our policyholders and providing value to our investors. We are fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to over 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?"

We also saw significant growth, not only in the corporate-affiliated agencies, but also with our independent agencies as well as our associates in all channels across the board. So we feel confident that, that growth was not about a single channel, but about a broader environment where Japanese consumers saw the need for our cancer product. We believe that will continue, thus our 15% increase projected over the next 3 quarters. As Kriss mentioned, he is correct. Sequentially, the numbers will remain the same. It's the rate of growth that we believe will really drop off in the fourth quarter. That said, it's very difficult to tell this far out with all of the different things that we're monitoring, how that's going to go. But the outstanding fourth quarter that happened here in Japan happened due to a concerted effort by our sales team. It capped off an incredible career for Toru Tonoike as our President, who had everyone aligned and ready to execute. And we have just gone through a wonderful succession here at Aflac Japan with Hiroshi Yamauchi coming on as the President. And I'd like to just let him make a quick comment before we turn it back over."

We did execute an agreement to retrocede 50% of the second tranche. You'll recall that the second tranche released about JPY 55 billion of FSA-based reserves, and that was executed on October 1 of last year. And so then we retroceded roughly half of that to actually our company that's domiciled in Columbia and South Carolina, CAIC or Aflac Group. And it effectively serves as an offset to the cost that we incurred for the reinsurance. So we'll pick up about $8 million or about $0.01 a share in this year from the retrocession, which will reduce the cost of the second tranche, which was probably around $0.025 a share so annualized. As far as the extent to which we might do this going forward, as I indicated at the Analyst Meeting we conducted in Tokyo last September, we're working on a multiyear capital plan. We're building out the framework for that plan and should be able to discuss more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But I'll tell you, we have been pleased with the reinsurance agreements we've executed. It's an effective and -- efficient and effective tool for us to use to release FSA-based capital.

I'll say that I -- you've heard me say in prior years, there are a lot of moving parts to our earnings estimates. And clearly, we're in recognition of the fact that the historically low interest rate environment is a headwind to us, both in new sales in Japan. We don't want to sell products that don't have appealing profit margins. And at today's yen-denominated interest rates, it's hard to get an appealing profit margin on a first sector sale. We have been doing some alternative investment strategies to mitigate that, and we'll continue to pursue those alternative investment strategies for the business we do sell. But the fact of the matter is that new sales will be a drag, first sector sales will be a drag a bit. The ability to invest current cash flows at attractive investment yields is a challenge. Eric can talk to that, if appropriate. And then you get to the benefit side of things. We've benefited from a decline in benefit ratios for a number of years now. And the way we do our earnings estimates, we take a look at where we are today. We tend not to anticipate any further improvement in a step to be conservative. We have experienced improvements and, therefore, we've been able to be at the mid- to high end of the earnings range for the last several years. In 2015, if we continue to get improvement, it will move us toward the high end of the range. If things stay about the same, it will probably stay in the mid part of the range. If things deteriorate a bit in terms of no additional improvement or some modest deterioration, things might move toward the low end of the range. But that's why we've got a range. It's just a lot of moving parts, and we don't have a lot more insight -- well, we don't have total insight into that, so that's why we give a range."

So I am sorry to be a -- to push on what seems like a good sales quarter at the end of the day.

And we don't want to act precipitously in just doing reinsurance deals for the sake of doing reinsurance deals because we can free up some of the additional reserves that are available in Japan. We want to have and identify appropriate use for that capital to the extent we choose to repatriate some of those proceeds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. and subsequently to Aflac Incorporated. There are uses for capital other than share repurchase, partly to make sure we've got squared up on our tax cash flows in the U.S. and some other things like the position of the U.S. operation from a capital perspective where we've -- we've been forcing the U.S. operation to kind of pay the shareholder dividends for some time, and there's a modest imbalance if you just looked at U.S. only versus Japan that we're trying to remediate. It's not a source of concern among ourselves or among the regulators, but it's something we're trying to do some advanced planning on. And there are certainly potential other uses for capital, so we're trying to do a more comprehensive program. And we'll have more to comment on, most likely at FAB, in terms of the progress we're making in that regard.

The other comment I'd like to make is really about the discipline that we're holding in first sector. Because of the record low interest rates we're seeing today and the profit margins that have already been mentioned around certain products, we are certainly restraining the total number and total volume of first sector sales given the current conditions. Given the large volume of exclusive agencies we have at Aflac, we are certainly going to continue some presence within selling first sector products. But in terms of broadly going after the first sector in the current environment, we're restraining those sales and looking to see a fairly significant decline in first sector sales in 2015 if these trends continue. We'll be closely monitoring, just as we did in the fourth quarter, and we'll be monitoring our sales. If conditions change for the better, we'll move in that direction. If conditions stay the same or worsen, we would react accordingly. But we have measures in place to affect our sales based on the type of business we want to be selling at Aflac."

Prior to all this volatility, as we do our budgets and planning and consistent with the SAA work that we've completed, it would have been about a 25%, 75% ratio. Though I should also say, as we think about the U.S. dollar allocation, it's not necessarily confined to U.S. corporates anymore. We certainly have widened the scope, but we could call it dollar assets. However, as you know, we're being very tactical. Rates have dropped, particularly in Japan. Because in the U.S., while treasuries have fallen, we have seen some credit spread widening that somewhat offset that. So the absolute yield levels haven't really dropped that much in the U.S. But in light of these very low yields, as you know, on the 10 year, it hit about 23 or 24. But since it popped up, the 10-year JGB has popped up to about 38. At these low yields, we would be inclined to underweight that allocation to JGBs. Meaning, to buy a 20- or 30-year maturity JGB, which is typically where we focus, at an average of perhaps 1% or so, we'd rather underweight that allocation this year at those low yields and put that money to use, whether in dollar assets, in traditional fixed income, or perhaps we do expect this year to get going with some of the growth assets that I've spoken about. So we're going to monitor that closely. As you guys know, the global macro conditions are changing drastically. We're cognizant of that. But at those low levels for JGBs, we would underweight our allocation relative to the original budget. The other thing I might mention as well, as we continue to evolve in our transformation, we are being tactical on our asset allocation. So as an example, because we've seen this dislocation in the credit market going back to about November, December, we firmly believe those good fundamental credits are still very strong in the U.S. So one of the things that we did late December, and we're completing up soon, is what we call a $1 billion asset allocation or switch trade. So we've moved out of about $1 billion of our investment grade corporates that we own and reallocated that about half to bank loans. We think that sector has gotten hit from technicals, not necessarily from credit quality and liquidity from the retail market. But given our long-term nature, we can take advantage of that and the other half of that into BB credits in the high yield sector. But the higher quality part of high yields, where we think on a relative value basis, that's a good long-term place to put our money. So we're not only focused on the new money that's coming in. And Kriss has talked about there will be less cash flows this year that's associated with how we do the product side, but we're also looking internal to our portfolio, what else can we do amongst our own assets to rotate, to take advantage of this. And everyone's heard me say we're in a great position around our capital levels. As you all know, we've cleaned up the past in terms of the portfolio. So we are positioned for when there are disruptions in the market, if there are asset classes and strategies that fit our SAA, we'll seek to try to take advantage of those. And of course, all of those things I've just mentioned are always within the risk limits. We have risk limits around all of these asset classes, around different credit quality and duration. And we've had capacity because we were derisking the portfolio over the last few years. So now is the time for us when these disruptions occur to take advantage of those risk limits and average into the markets."

So for example, when we look at the JGBs, they do provide us with yen interest rate protection versus our liabilities, so that the liabilities are all in yen. So that's a very important factor. And we look at the SAA, our JGB allocation is what I would call at the lower end of the range. It could be a lot higher if we wanted even better matching characteristics, but the privates help with that as well because they are yen-denominated. So we will take a look at that, but I don't think there's an infinite amount of capacity to, say, take JGBs down by 10% of the total portfolio and reallocate. There may be some opportunities around the edges. And then, finally, just for clarification, most of our JGBs are in either HTM or what we call PRM, policy reserve matching. We have very few in AFS. But even within PRM, there are some opportunities to do asset allocation and rotate, but I just want to clarify the accounting designation."

Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor.

Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 21.3% in the quarter. This result established a strong start toward our expectation that third sector sales would average an increase of 15% for the first 9 months of the year. Sales of cancer insurance continued to be extremely strong, following the introduction at the end of the third quarter, the new Cancer DAYS product, which includes an exclusive policy sole for Japan Post. 
Following an outstanding fourth quarter 2014, recession of this product cancer insurance sales in the first quarter generated 118% increase through all distribution channels and outlets. 
Our distribution side, our strategic alliance with Japan Post continues to be enormously beneficial. This alliance leverages work in Japan, with Aflac Japan status as a leading industry and pioneer of cancer insurance. 
Our tremendous progress continues as more than 10,000 postal outlets offering our cancer insurance to their customers. I believe this allowance -- alliance will continue to benefit both companies as the opportunities to purchase cancer insurance is extended to more and more Japanese consumers. At the same time, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. 
Our goal is to have a presence, where consumers want to make their insurance decisions, and our various distribution outlets broaden for that reach. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter conference call, we expected the first quarter sales would be challenging. As we communicated, the expense ratio increased during the quarter, primarily reflecting the expenses related to the changes we made to our sales organization over the last several months. We believe these changes, which were implemented to enhance our sales growth, are better positioning Aflac U.S. for the future. 
At the same time, we just started something no one in the industry has ever attempted, no less, done and that is the 1-day pay. The industry first initiative means that we process, approve and pay in just 1 day. We're delivering on our promise to our policyholders in a more meaningful way of getting cash in their hands faster than ever, faster than anyone, in fact. 
We estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use 1-day pay for their clients. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the perimeters of this initiative. 1-day pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels, our accounts and our policyholders. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe 1-day pay will continue to help Aflac stand out. 
As I mentioned last quarter, I'm not willing to say that Aflac U.S. sales had turned the corner until we see the results for the first half of the year. At the same time, I remain encouraged by the progress that we've seen and continue to see. I still believe Aflac U.S. sales will increase 3% to 7% for the year. We'll continue to advance our efforts toward expanding our distribution to access employers of all sizes. Doing so will allow us more opportunities to leverage our brand and attract -- have attractive products in the portfolio in an ever-changing health care environment. 
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic that I know our top of mind with our shareholders and that is capital deployment. Our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders puts us in an excellent position to repatriate about JPY 200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015. This reinforces our plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of our common stock in 2015 and puts us in a good position for next year as well. 
I want to reiterate that our are objective for 2015 remains to increase operating earnings per diluted share 2% to 7% before the effect of currency. Challenging financial markets in a very low interest rate make it difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore, we will continue to be very disciplined in selling first sector products in Japan, which will reduce investable cash flows. 
As always, we're working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objectives, while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. I am pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best-branded company for voluntary and/or supplemental products in each country. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them extremely well suited for the products that we offer. 
Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. We are fortunate that in the process of growing our business, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. 
Now I turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?"

I think you can anticipate that there will be more transactions each. We've been taking this one step at a time. The very first transaction we did, we did to increase the SMR, to reduce the exposure we have to volatility in interest rates and currency and the like. The second one we did to achieve the same objectives that will reduce cost and did the first retrocession deal.

So clearly, taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem those high interest expense senior notes, $850 million of senior notes that had a 8.5% coupon will benefit us going forward. That wasn't directly reflected in the original EPS guidance. But again, it's too early in the year to say that we're going narrow the range, at this point, that we initially established. Clearly, that particular transaction will increase our certainty that we'll be able to perform within that range and certainly, it adds to our ability to perform more strongly than we originally anticipated.

First of all, you're correct that we've had strong sales in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, and we feel that the market's desire for our new cancer plan has been extremely strong. As we noted in the previous call, we are expecting the first 3 quarters of this year to be strong, with a 15% growth over those 3 quarters. At this point, we're not changing that number. If we see sales continue to go extremely strong through the end of the second quarter, we, at that time, talk about any kind of revision. But given the size of the fourth quarter of 2014 and the hurdle that is over time, I'm hesitant yet to talk about any changes in annual sales guidance. But I have to say, overall, I am very pleased with sales, not only through Japan Post, but across the board. All of our channels have been extremely receptive. I do, however, believe there are many things we're doing to continue to increase our long-term sales. Anytime we announced new product announcements, things of that nature, there can be an adverse impact to short-term sales in a 13-week period. And so as we move further into the year, there are things that may not necessarily cause us to perform at the same optimum level we're performing at today, but we'll still achieve excellent results and so we're very excited about where it's going to forward from here.

On the related share repurchase, I can't help noticing that your business in Japan on a constant currency basis, is reporting lower earnings. Your profits are down this year on a constant currency basis and it's not the yen. My question is when do you expect to start seeing the earnings? not Earnings per share but earnings of your business in Japan growing and relatedly, what would you be at this point in the history of the company as the sustainable growth rate of yours. sort of the long-term sustainable growth rate of your Japan business."

First, regarding first quarter Japan operating results, we were down a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. We had better -- well, lower benefit ratios last year in the first quarter than we had our magnitude of plain reserve adjustments. Last year, we had a some release of claim reserves to get us down to the high end of the range that our auditors like to see. And last year, we had a larger release than we have this year. We did have some release this year but again, we're -- we maintain conservative claim reserves, I believe. And we'd rather be within the range that the auditors independently recalculate. And so we did have it was really more difficult comparison, so to speak, of earnings first quarter '15 versus '14. Overall, I would say that we had the headwinds, primarily of low interest rates slows and the like, impacting our operating earnings in Japan and keep in mind, our margins in Japan are the highest in the industry. And we really don't anticipate that they'll increase significantly. We've got a bit of a mix shift going on still between first and third sector and even though first sector sales are down relative to where they have been as was previously pointed out, they're still significant and we're still having a larger proportion of our overall premium income be associated with first sector products as the business continues to earn out on the premium thing basis. Long-term growth rates, Eric, the way I look at it is at least related to the third sector business, the medical and cancer. I will relate our fundamental business to the level of health care expenditures in the country. And in Japan, we anticipate the level of health care expenditures will continue to increase. Independent statistics have numbers in the 5% range, and our fundamental business in the third sector is to help our policyholders meet their share of the health care cost that they have to bear in Japan. Right now, under the national healthcare program, the copayments are 30%. We think those will either remain stable or increase going forward. And that might increase our opportunity to further our medical sales. Regarding first sector sales, it's going to depend on the trend in interest rates. Right now, we -- the profit margins are lower than what we want to have in our portfolios. So we're deemphasizing the production of first sector business. So..."

And pretty much what I would have said, Chris covered, especially when it comes to third sector. Because that's really the way I view our business. The first sector is nothing but an introduction of selling, ultimately, third sector products. And I would like to see a growth rate of 5% in new sales. It gets tougher as the number gets bigger. But that's a gold that's certainly worthy of us continuing to strive for. And no one's got the distribution systems we have. And so we're always looking for new products and ways to do that. That if we right now, working on another new product, which we can't talk about but that we're doing, we will constantly be revamping. And then the wild card, as Kriss said, is whether or not the co-pays and deductibles go up. I don't have any reason to think they are tomorrow other than if you look at the issues they're having regarding their budgets, they're continuing to have problems and they've got to find a way to bring down their deficits. And with an aging population, there's a much higher likelihood that it's going to continue to go up, not down. So I would think it'll the more pressure on reviewing and seeing if they want to increase the co-pays and deductibles and if they do that, that's the game changer for us."

And so instead of reinsuring 100% of the block of business, you reinsure 10% of it. And accordingly, you have 10% of the cost. It is a risk-sharing transaction between Aflac Japan and the reinsurer and then it's a reassuring transaction between the reinsurer back to the U.S. subsidiary, CAIC. It's a legal entity that picks up the retrocession. So clearly, there are cost transfers but net to the overall company. You're correct. So let me just tell you that we don't -- we haven't had to do asset transfers in this coinsurance. The prospect of cash flows on the block of business is such that no asset transfer was done in any of the tranches. And we just ceded the liability for future claims and exchange for our share of the gross premium. And there is a net cost associated with it. Just to review the very first tranche that we did for capital raising purposes in Japan. Basically, we did it because that was the lowest cost of capital of any alternative we have. And we've reduced the cost or reduced the size of the future tranches through the retrocession. So we are achieving some reserve relief on an FSA basis, enhancing our solvency margin, continuing to protect policyholders and the like. But continuing to free up some of, what I sometimes referred to as stereo capital. So that's an overview."

And unless we've got an appropriate use for the reinsurance, we're not going to have the appetite. I've covered the uses of capital from the reinsurance we've done so far. We certainly got additional capacity in terms of the blocks of third sector business in Japan. We've certainly got to continue to have an excess of FSA reserves over U.S. statutory reserves. On the same block, and I'm confident that the U.S. statutory reserves are adequate. So we believe we've got some opportunity to relieve ourselves of some of the excess reserves we're holding on an FSA basis. But there's no point in doing a risk-sharing reinsurance arrangement unless you have an appropriate use of capital. And again, I'll give you some more color on that in May. I don't want to do it on this call. But we do have significantly more financial flexibility today after having done the reinsurance and particularly at a lower net cost than we had 18 months ago.

Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 21.3% in the quarter. This result established a strong start toward our expectation that third sector sales would average an increase of 15% for the first 9 months of the year. Sales of cancer insurance continued to be extremely strong, following the introduction at the end of the third quarter, the new Cancer DAYS product, which includes an exclusive policy sole for Japan Post. 
Following an outstanding fourth quarter 2014, recession of this product, cancer insurance, sales in the first quarter generated 118% increase through all distribution channels and outlets. 
Our distribution side, our strategic alliance with Japan Post continues to be enormously beneficial. This alliance leverages work in Japan, with Aflac Japan status as a leading industry and pioneer of cancer insurance. 
Our tremendous progress continues, as more than 10,000 postal outlets offering our cancer insurance to their customers. I believe this allowance -- alliance will continue to benefit both companies as the opportunity to purchase cancer insurance is extended to more and more Japanese consumers. At the same time, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. 
Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance decisions, and our various distribution outlets broaden for that reach. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter conference call, we expected the first quarter sales would be challenging. As we communicated, the expense ratio increased during the quarter, primarily reflecting the expenses related to the changes we made to our sales organization over the last several months. We believe these changes, which were implemented to enhance our sales growth, are better positioning Aflac U.S. for the future. 
At the same time, we just started something no one in the industry has ever attempted, no less, done. And that is the One Day Pay. The industry-first initiative means that we process, approve and pay in just one day. We're delivering on our promise to our policyholders in a more meaningful way of getting cash in their hands faster than ever, faster than anyone, in fact. 
We estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their clients. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the perimeters of this initiative. One Day Pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels, our accounts and our policyholders. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to help Aflac stand out. 
As I mentioned last quarter, I'm not willing to say that Aflac U.S. sales had turned the corner until we see the results for the first half of the year. At the same time, I remain encouraged by the progress that we've seen and continue to see. I still believe Aflac U.S. sales will increase 3% to 7% for the year. We'll continue to advance our efforts toward expanding our distribution to access employers of all sizes. Doing so will allow us more opportunities to leverage our brand and attract -- have attractive products in the portfolio in an ever-changing health care environment. 
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic that I know are top of mind with our shareholders, and that is capital deployment. Our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders puts us in an excellent position to repatriate about JPY 200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015. This reinforces our plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of our common stock in 2015 and puts us in a good position for next year as well. 
I want to reiterate that our objective for 2015 remains to increase operating earnings per diluted share 2% to 7% before the effect of currency. Challenging financial markets in a very low interest rate make it difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore, we will continue to be very disciplined in selling first sector products in Japan, which will reduce investable cash flows. 
As always, we're working very hard to achieve our earnings-per-share objectives, while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. I am pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best-branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them extremely well suited for the products that we offer. 
Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. We are fortunate that in the process of growing our business, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide.

The previous agreements had been done with Swiss Re. This one was done with Munich. We had been talking with several reinsurance partners and we wanted to expand our track record of business relationships and -- so we did that. The retrocession was similar in substance to the previous retrocession we did in the second tranche with Swiss Re, but it was a higher amount. It was 90% of the block instead of 50% that we did in the second deal. Accordingly, it will -- there will be a lower net cost to Aflac on a consolidated basis than there was in the previous transaction."

The very first transaction we did, we did to increase the SMR to reduce the exposure we have to volatility in interest rates and currency and the like. The second one we did to achieve the same objectives that will reduce cost it did the first retrocession deal.

If we see sales continue to go extremely strong through the end of the second quarter, we'll, at that time, talk about any kind of revision. But given the size of the fourth quarter of 2014 and the hurdle that it is to overcome, I'm hesitant yet to talk about any changes in annual sales guidance. But I have to say, overall, I am very pleased with sales, not only through Japan Post, but across the board. All of our channels had been extremely receptive. I do, however, believe that there are many things we're doing to continue to increase our long-term sales. Anytime we announce new product announcements, things of that nature, there can be an adverse impact to short-term sales in a 13-week period. And so as we move further into the year, there are things that may not necessarily cause us to perform at the same optimum level we're performing at today, but we'll still achieve excellent results and so we're very excited about where it's going to forward from here.

We do have growth there. And so this has been an evolution as we're going through this process of trying to add on brokers while protecting and building our existing field force. And that's been a real challenge for us but it's -- under Teresa's leadership, it's doing very well and I'm very encouraged about that. And I think long term, these decisions that we've made have been the right ones. I will make one comment about recruiting and that is that we've made so many changes from a production perspective that there's a lot going on. And so all of its time together, I like the One Day Pay, I like that we're -- that we've set it up in a way that these people -- our important market directors will do very well, that the company does very well and they won't if we don't. So I think it's all working nicely together. And as I said in my comments, I'm not willing to declare victory. But it's certainly going the direction. I'd like it to go faster as Teresa would, but it's still moving in the right direction of what we ultimately want to accomplish. I do find it interesting with all the changes we made that we did not lose any market directors. And so there's probably a few that will change out, but if they don't do as well, they won't make as much and they may retire or whatever. So there's still some changes probably to take place. But all in all, I think we're going down the path that is going to prove that it's working the right way. It's just a question of how fast it's working."

First, regarding first quarter Japan operating results, we were down a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. We had better -- well, lower benefit ratios last year in the first quarter than we had -- or magnitude of plain reserve adjustments. Last year, we had some release of claim reserves to get us down to the high end of the range that our auditors like to see. And last year, we had a larger release than we have this year. We did have some release this year but, again, we're -- we maintain conservative claim reserves, I believe. And we'd rather be within the range that the auditors independently recalculate. And so we just to have -- it was really a more difficult comparison, so to speak, of earnings, first quarter '15 versus '14. Overall, I would say that we had the headwinds, primarily of low interest rates slows and the like impacting our operating earnings in Japan, and keep in mind, our margins in Japan are the highest in the industry. And we really don't anticipate that they'll increase significantly. We've got a bit of a mix shift going on still between first and third sector and even though first sector sales are down relative to where they had been as was previously pointed out, they're still significant and we're still having a larger proportion of our overall premium income be associated with first sector products as the business continues to earn out on the premium thing basis. Long-term growth rates, Eric, the way I look at it is that at least related to the third sector business, the medical and cancer. I'll relate our fundamental business to the level of health care expenditures in the country. And in Japan, we anticipate the level of health care expenditures will continue to increase. Independent statistics have numbers in the 5% range, and our fundamental business in the third sector is to help our policyholders meet their fair share of the health care cost that they have to bear in Japan. Right now, under the national healthcare program, the copayments are 30%. We think those will either remain stable or increase going forward. And that might increase our opportunity to further our medical sales. Regarding first sector sales, it's going to depend on the trend in interest rates. Right now, we -- the profit margins were lower than what we want to have in our portfolios. So we're deemphasizing the production of first sector business. So..."

And pretty much what I would have said, Chris covered, especially when it comes to third sector. Because that's really the way I view our business. The first sector is nothing but an introduction of selling ultimately third sector products. And I would like to see a growth rate of 5% in new sales. It gets tougher as the number gets bigger. But that's a goal that's certainly worthy of us continuing to strive for. And no one's got the distribution systems we have, and so we're always looking for new products and ways to do that. And if we are right now working on another new product, which we can't talk about but that we're doing, we will constantly be revamping. And then the wild card, as Kriss said, is whether or not the co-pays and deductibles go up. I don't have any reason to think they are tomorrow other than if you look at the issues they're having regarding their budgets, they're continuing to have problems and they've got to find a way to bring down their deficits. And with an aging population, there's a much higher likelihood that it's going to continue to go up, not down. So I would think they'll be more pressure on reviewing and seeing if they want to increase the co-pays and deductibles, and if they do that, that's a game changer for us."

It is a risk-sharing transaction between Aflac Japan and the reinsurer and then it's a reassuring transaction between the reinsurer back to the U.S. subsidiary, CAIC. That's a legal entity that picks up the retrocession. So clearly, there are cost transfers but net to the overall company, you're correct. So let me just tell you that we didn't -- we haven't had to do asset transfers in this coinsurance. The prospective cash flows on the block of business is such that no asset transfer was done in any of the tranches, and we just ceded the liability for future claims and exchange for our share of the gross premium. And there is a net cost associated with it. Just to review the very first tranche that we did for capital raising purposes in Japan, basically, we did it because that was the lowest cost of capital of any alternative we had. And we've reduced the cost or reduced the size of the future tranches through the retrocession. So we are achieving some reserve relief on an FSA basis, enhancing our solvency margin, continuing to protect policyholders and the like. But continuing to free up some of, what I sometimes refer to as 0 [ph] capital. So that's an overview."

I want there to be an appropriate use of capital in order to incur the cost regardless of how small the cost maybe. If there's still a capital cost associated with doing the deal, and unless we've got an appropriate use for the reinsurance, we're not going to have the appetite. I've covered the uses of capital from the reinsurance we've done so far. We've certainly got additional capacity in terms of the blocks of third sector business in Japan. We've certainly got to continue to have an excess of FSA reserves over U.S. statutory reserves on the same block, and I'm confident that the U.S. statutory reserves are adequate. So we believe we've got some opportunity to relieve ourselves of some of the excess reserves we're holding on an FSA basis.

So I think we're in a much stronger and more flexible financial position, having done each of these 3 transactions and proven we could do it, we'd continue to have reinsurance capacity, both from the 2 companies we've done business with so far. And we've got other parties that continue to knock on our door and ask for opportunities. So we're happy with where we are."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor.

Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 21.3% in the quarter. This result established a strong start toward our expectation that third sector sales would average an increase of 15% for the first 9 months of the year. Sales of cancer insurance continued to be extremely strong, following the introduction at the end of the third quarter, the new Cancer DAYS product, which includes an exclusive policy sole for Japan Post. 
Following an outstanding fourth quarter 2014, recession of this product, cancer insurance, sales in the first quarter generated 118% increase through all distribution channels and outlets. 
Our distribution side, our strategic alliance with Japan Post continues to be enormously beneficial. This alliance leverages work in Japan, with Aflac Japan status as a leading industry and pioneer of cancer insurance. 
Our tremendous progress continues, as more than 10,000 postal outlets offering our cancer insurance to their customers. I believe this allowance -- alliance will continue to benefit both companies as the opportunity to purchase cancer insurance is extended to more and more Japanese consumers. At the same time, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. 
Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance decisions, and our various distribution outlets broaden for that reach. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter conference call, we expected the first quarter sales would be challenging. As we communicated, the expense ratio increased during the quarter, primarily reflecting the expenses related to the changes we made to our sales organization over the last several months. We believe these changes, which were implemented to enhance our sales growth, are better positioning Aflac U.S. for the future. 
At the same time, we just started something no one in the industry has ever attempted, no less, done. And that is the One Day Pay. The industry-first initiative means that we process, approve and pay in just one day. We're delivering on our promise to our policyholders in a more meaningful way of getting cash in their hands faster than ever, faster than anyone, in fact. 
We estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their clients. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the perimeters of this initiative. One Day Pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels, our accounts and our policyholders. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to help Aflac stand out. 
As I mentioned last quarter, I'm not willing to say that Aflac U.S. sales had turned the corner until we see the results for the first half of the year. At the same time, I remain encouraged by the progress that we've seen and continue to see. I still believe Aflac U.S. sales will increase 3% to 7% for the year. We'll continue to advance our efforts toward expanding our distribution to access employers of all sizes. Doing so will allow us more opportunities to leverage our brand and attract -- have attractive products in the portfolio in an ever-changing health care environment. 
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic that I know are top of mind with our shareholders, and that is capital deployment. Our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders puts us in an excellent position to repatriate about JPY 200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015. This reinforces our plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of our common stock in 2015 and puts us in a good position for next year as well. 
I want to reiterate that our objective for 2015 remains to increase operating earnings per diluted share 2% to 7% before the effect of currency. Challenging financial markets in a very low interest rate make it difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore, we will continue to be very disciplined in selling first sector products in Japan, which will reduce investable cash flows. 
As always, we're working very hard to achieve our earnings-per-share objectives, while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. I am pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best-branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them extremely well suited for the products that we offer. 
Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. We are fortunate that in the process of growing our business, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide.

I consider 2% to 7% increase in EPS on a currency-neutral basis to be a fairly wide range. We do wide ranges because we know that some things are going to go well, some things aren't going to go quite as well. And we're always working at activities that will move us up in the range. So clearly, taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem those high interest expense senior notes, the $850 million of senior notes that had a 8.5% coupon will benefit us going forward. That wasn't directly reflected in the original EPS guidance. But again, it's too early in the year to say that we're going narrow the range, at this point, that we initially established. Clearly, that particular transaction will increase our certainty that we'll be able to perform within that range and certainly, it adds to our ability to perform more strongly than we originally anticipated.

I'll start and if Yamauchi wants to add additional comments, I'll let him do so. First of all, you're correct that we've had strong sales in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, and we feel that the market's desire for our new cancer plan has been extremely strong. As we noted in the previous call, we are expecting the first 3 quarters of this year to be strong, with a 15% growth over those 3 quarters. At this point, we're not changing that number. If we see sales continue to go extremely strong through the end of the second quarter, we'll, at that time, talk about any kind of revision. But given the size of the fourth quarter of 2014 and the hurdle that it is to overcome, I'm hesitant yet to talk about any changes in annual sales guidance. But I have to say, overall, I am very pleased with sales, not only through Japan Post, but across the board. All of our channels had been extremely receptive. I do, however, believe that there are many things we're doing to continue to increase our long-term sales. Anytime we announce new product announcements, things of that nature, there can be an adverse impact to short-term sales in a 13-week period. And so as we move further into the year, there are things that may not necessarily cause us to perform at the same optimum level we're performing at today, but we'll still achieve excellent results and so we're very excited about where it's going to forward from here. I think we're good."

And we repriced the products with an interest assumption of 1.25%. So we still -- we'd have a positive spread at our anticipated yield for the year. If we look at first quarter only, at 1.1%, it'd be pretty marginal. There are sources of profits, so as an interest spread, but for the quarter itself it'd be closer to breakeven than profitable on that first sector business. But keep in mind, we're writing the first sector business, primarily as an accommodation to keep distribution alive and maintain relationships primarily with the banks. So to some extent, first sector business today is an accommodation and we do have caps on total production to try to mitigate the lower anticipated profit opportunity at these low interest rates."

While I certainly understand value appreciate what you're doing on the capital accounts side of things, with the reinsurance, repatriation and so forth and the related share repurchase, I can't help noticing that your business in Japan, on a constant-currency basis, is reporting lower earnings. Your profits are down this year on a constant-currency basis and it's -- right, so it's not the yen. My question is when do you expect to start seeing the earnings, not the earnings per share but the earnings of your business in Japan growing and relatedly, what would you view at this point, in the history of the company, as the sustainable growth rate of your -- sort of the long-term sustainable growth rate of your Japan business."

First, regarding first quarter Japan operating results, we were down a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. We had better -- well, lower benefit ratios last year in the first quarter than we had -- or magnitude of plain reserve adjustments. Last year, we had some release of claim reserves to get us down to the high end of the range that our auditors like to see. And last year, we had a larger release than we have this year. We did have some release this year but, again, we're -- we maintain conservative claim reserves, I believe. And we'd rather be within the range that the auditors independently recalculate. And so we just to have -- it was really a more difficult comparison, so to speak, of earnings, first quarter '15 versus '14. Overall, I would say that we had the headwinds, primarily of low interest rates slows and the like impacting our operating earnings in Japan, and keep in mind, our margins in Japan are the highest in the industry. And we really don't anticipate that they'll increase significantly. We've got a bit of a mix shift going on still between first and third sector and even though first sector sales are down relative to where they had been as was previously pointed out, they're still significant and we're still having a larger proportion of our overall premium income be associated with first sector products as the business continues to earn out on the premium thing basis. Long-term growth rates, Eric, the way I look at it is that at least related to the third sector business, the medical and cancer. I'll relate our fundamental business to the level of health care expenditures in the country. And in Japan, we anticipate the level of health care expenditures will continue to increase. Independent statistics have numbers in the 5% range, and our fundamental business in the third sector is to help our policyholders meet their share of the health care cost that they have to bear in Japan. Right now, under the national healthcare program, the copayments are 30%. We think those will either remain stable or increase going forward. And that might increase our opportunity to further our medical sales. Regarding first sector sales, it's going to depend on the trend in interest rates. Right now, we -- the profit margins were lower than what we want to have in our portfolios. So we're deemphasizing the production of first sector business. So..."

And pretty much what I would have said, Chris covered, especially when it comes to third sector. Because that's really the way I view our business. The first sector is nothing but an introduction of selling ultimately third sector products. And I would like to see a growth rate of 5% in new sales. It gets tougher as the number gets bigger. But that's a goal that's certainly worthy of us continuing to strive for. And no one's got the distribution systems we have, and so we're always looking for new products and ways to do that. And if we are right now working on another new product, which we can't talk about but that we're doing, we will constantly be revamping. And then the wild card, as Kriss said, is whether or not the co-pays and deductibles go up. I don't have any reason to think they are tomorrow other than if you look at the issues they're having regarding their budgets, they're continuing to have problems and they've got to find a way to bring down their deficits. And with an aging population, there's a much higher likelihood that it's going to continue to go up, not down. So I would think they'll be more pressure on reviewing and seeing if they want to increase the co-pays and deductibles, and if they do that, that's a game changer for us."

And so instead of reinsuring 100% of a block of business, you reinsure 10% of it. And accordingly, you have 10% of the cost. It is a risk-sharing transaction between Aflac Japan and the reinsurer and then it's a reassuring transaction between the reinsurer back to the U.S. subsidiary, CAIC. That's a legal entity that picks up the retrocession. So clearly, there are cost transfers but net to the overall company, you're correct. So let me just tell you that we didn't -- we haven't had to do asset transfers in this coinsurance. The prospective cash flows on the block of business is such that no asset transfer was done in any of the tranches, and we just ceded the liability for future claims and exchange for our share of the gross premium. And there is a net cost associated with it. Just to review the very first tranche that we did for capital raising purposes in Japan, basically, we did it because that was the lowest cost of capital of any alternative we had. And we've reduced the cost or reduced the size of the future tranches through the retrocession. So we are achieving some reserve relief on an FSA basis, enhancing our solvency margin, continuing to protect policyholders and the like. But continuing to free up some of, what I sometimes refer to as 0 [ph] capital. So that's an overview."

I want there to be an appropriate use of capital in order to incur the cost regardless of how small the cost maybe. If there's still a capital cost associated with doing the deal, and unless we've got an appropriate use for the reinsurance, we're not going to have the appetite. I've covered the uses of capital from the reinsurance we've done so far. We've certainly got additional capacity in terms of the blocks of third sector business in Japan. We've certainly got to continue to have an excess of FSA reserves over U.S. statutory reserves on the same block, and I'm confident that the U.S. statutory reserves are adequate. So we believe we've got some opportunity to relieve ourselves of some of the excess reserves we're holding on an FSA basis. But there's no point in doing a risk-sharing reinsurance arrangement unless you have an appropriate use of capital. And again, I'll give you some more color on that in May. I don't want to do it on this call. But we do have significantly more financial flexibility today after having done the reinsurance and particularly at a lower net cost than we had 18 months ago. So I think we're in a much stronger and more flexible financial position, having done each of these 3 transactions and proven we could do it, we'd continue to have reinsurance capacity, both from the 2 companies we've done business with so far.

From Tokyo, also joining us today is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan.
Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results do differ materially from those we discuss today. 
We encourage you to look at the quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact those results. Now I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in both the U.S. and Japan. Dan?"
250178,281476059,841455,"AFLAC Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased with the sales of the third quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second",1007,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. 
I am extremely pleased with the sales of the third quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second quarter and 23.3% year-to-date. In addition to continued strong sales of our cancer insurance, the new medical product we introduced last month has proven to be very attractive in what has become a very competitive market.
From a distribution standpoint, Aflac Japan generated positive sales growth from all of our sales channels, which lets us know we're focused in the right direction. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions and these results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.
Keep in mind that Aflac Japan's fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. Giving strong third sector sales growth in the first half of the year and the positive reception to the enhanced medical product, we now anticipate that sales of third sector products will increase between 7% to 10% for the full year. This is much stronger than our original expectation and impressive given that our already leading market share position in the third sector products.
Now let me turn to our U.S. operation. I am encouraged that the second quarter sales improved over the first quarter results. I believe that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure last year are setting the stage for bigger and better sales opportunities. Additionally, One Day Pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels and accounts and policyholders. Through the industry-leading claims initiative, we're able to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. This allows us to deliver on our promise to our policyholders, even more meaningfully by getting cash in their hands faster than ever. We continued to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the parameters of this initiative. Along with our strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to underscore the value of Aflac's products and ultimately help Aflac sales long-term.
At the same time, 2015 continues to be a year building in Aflac's group. We are making progress with advancing our relationships and our potential business opportunities for insurance brokers and larger case market. As our production through broker and larger employers grow, we anticipate that sales will be driven progressively toward the fourth quarter, which will magnify the seasonal patterns of our sales to a certain extent. We continue to concentrate our efforts on increasing Aflac U.S. sales 3% to 7% for the year. 
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top of mind with the shareholders and that's capital deployment. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders. We continue to believe our capital strength puts us in an excellent position to repatriate approximately JPY 200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015, which continues to reinforce our plan to repurchase $1.3 billion of the common stock in 2015 and places us in a good position for the next year as well. 
As I've said in the financial analyst briefing in May we believe that over the next few years, all else equal, we will have opportunities to increase the capital available for deployment. Let me reiterate that our strong buys is first to continue with our strong record of dividend growth followed by repurchasing of our stock and third disciplined investment in organic growth initiatives.
With the first half of the year complete, I'm pleased with the company's results. We have appropriately revised our target for 2015 operating earnings per diluted share to now be in the range of 4% to 7% on a currency neutral basis. Historically, the majority of the expenses have skewed more toward the end of the year, however, we have expedited some of the spending in the first half of the year and now believe expenses should lessen in the latter part of the year.
Of note, some of the expense acceleration is driving strong growth rates and we are experiencing in Japan, and expect to experience in the United States. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objective while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. 
Now let me turn to a topic I know you're eager to hear about. As most of you know, Fred Crawford has joined the Aflac team at the end of June as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At our analyst meeting in May, I shared how important it was that we bring in someone who not only has a new perspective, but who as a leader also enriches our corporate culture. Ultimately, the corporate culture of our organization is a very important factor leadership because it helps define the company's common goals, objectives and standard of behavior that employees have come to count on. 
Throughout Fred's 3 decades of financial leadership experience, he's consistently demonstrated that he possesses the characteristics that we've been looking for and we believe he is the right man for the job. Let me just say that he's off to a tremendous part at Aflac in terms of overseeing the financial management of the company's operations, including global investments.
As you know, Chris is continuing his duty as President of the corporation. In addition, he's working closely with Fred as he transitions to Aflac. Fred has also been rolling up his sleeves and I can tell you that he fits right in to Aflac. Fred, we're glad to have you. Now Chris is going to say a few words about the transition followed by Fred who will then turn it back over to Robin. Chris?"

And I look forward to continuing to serve Aflac and all of its stakeholders, including the investment community, as President of Aflac Incorporated at the pleasure of Dan and the board. I've always wanted to transition my CFO duties at a time when Aflac is financially strong. And today, looking at our capital position and our earnings process -- prospects, I certainly believe that to be the case.
I'm pleased we were able to upwardly revised our EPS guidance for 2015, we've performed at or better than expected for the first six months and our outlook for the full year is more favorable than our original estimates. Accordingly, I believe Fred is joining us at a good time and I'm enjoying working with him as he transitions to his new responsibilities.
Now let me tell you that Dan and I were immediately impressed with Fred during our interview process. We believe his breadth and depth of experience, as well as his exposure to the financial challenges that the industry faces, gives him a perspective that will significantly benefit Aflac. But equally important to us was Fred's history as an active partner with his preview CEOs. I have complete confidence that Fred will capitalize on those experiences and fully meet our expectations of him as Aflac's next CFO. 
So with that build up, let me turn it over to Fred for a few comments."

Let me start by also thanking the entire management team here at Aflac for welcoming me to the Aflac family, particularly Dan and Chris who have built out a very comprehensive transition plan for me into the new CFO role. It's a real privilege to be here. 
Ever since I started with the company nearly a month ago, it's been a whirlwind of meetings and activities directed towards gaining a deeper understanding of the operations, our strategy, key initiatives and of course, the key financial drivers. 
I've had an opportunity to spend a productive week in Japan. I also attended a sales force meeting in the U.S. and countless briefing sessions at various -- with various areas of the organization, especially on matters related to driving growth valuation and efficient capital management. 
It's clear to me that here at Aflac, we have a very high-caliber level of people who are dedicated, compassionate and who genuinely love what they do. I joined the company at a particularly good time, as the strategic planning process is underway and the 2016 financial planning process begins.
I will understandably play a more limited role on this call. But as I immerse myself in operations, investments and the financial details, I look forward to sharing their perspectives with you in the future periods. 
I can assure you that under Dan and Chris' leadership, the team is laser focused in driving growth, effectively deploying capital back to our shareholders and leveraging our platform here in the U.S. and Japan. So with that, I'm very excited to be here and I look forward to more opportunities to interact with all of you. And I'll hand it back to Robin. Robin?"

I'd like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning, starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 15.7%.

Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 15.7%. In reference to top line offline and in terms, revenues as reported were flat for the quarter, excluding the impact of the yen revenues declined 1.4%. 
In terms of the quarterly operating ratios the benefits to total revenues declined slightly compared to last year, going from 60.6% [ph] to 60.5% [ph] in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would've been 61.3%.
Reinsurance had 110 basis points positive impact on the benefit ratio in the quarter.
The expense ratio in the quarter increased to 18.4% from 17.7%. Expenses were in large part due to write-offs, software development costs related to modernization activity, planned increase spending associated with upgrading of our system software in Japan, and also promotional expenditures for our new medical product. The pretax profit margin declined slightly during the quarter, going from 21.7% [ph] to 21.1% [ph]. Excluding the impact of the yen, the pretax profit margin for the quarter would've been 20.1%. 
With the retraction of the margin, pretax margins declined 3.1% in the yen terms. Excluding the yen, pretax earnings would've been 8.9% -- would have declined 8.9%.
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. where total revenues rose 1.9% for the quarter. And looking at the operating ratios, the benefit ratio was 47.7% compared to 48.1%. The primary reason for this improvement was the continued favorable claims experience. 
The operating expense ratio increased going from 31.6% [ph] to 32.8% [ph]. This increase is the result of increased spending on the U.S. sales strategy as we discussed before and is in line with our expectation.
And now looking at some of the other items. Noninsurance expense at corporate level were $38 million compared to $51 million a year ago. This decline reflects the impact of extinguishment of the debt that skewed last quarter. Parent Company and other expenses were $20 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of '14. 
On an operating basis, the corporate tax rate was 34.6 [ph] compared to 34.5 [ph] last year.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share before the yen impact were 164 [ph] compared to 166 [ph] a year ago. The weaker yen decreased operating earnings by $0.14 per diluted share for the quarter.
Lastly, let me comment and reiterate some of the statements Dan made. We have upwardly revised the target for our objectives for 2015 and now expect operating earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 4% to 7%. 
For the third quarter, if the yen averages 120 to 125, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of 140 [ph] to 153 [ph] per diluted share. Using the same currency assumptions for the full year, we would expect to report EPS somewhere in the range of $5.88 or $6.17 per diluted share.
Before we take your questions, I'd like to take this opportunity to update everyone on a change in the timing of our earnings guidance practice. After careful consideration, we concluded the best practice would be to provide earnings guidance in December for the following year in the form of a dedicated outlook call. We believe this process better aligns us with the natural timeline of our financial planning process. Additionally, this practice also puts us more in line with the guidance disclosure practices of many of our peers. 
Now we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me remind you, to be fair to everybody, please limit your question, one initial question and only that's only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. We will now take the first question please."

The recruiting number consist of both broker recruits and career agents. And on the broker side, we've purposefully reduced the number of recruits there because our goal is to strengthen and deepen the relationships that we have with our current brokers. We've hired 120 broker and sales professionals, and our goal is to continue to earn the business of each of those broker houses and to help them to grow their business. Now -- and many of these are large broker houses that we have these relationships with. So we knew that the business would skew toward the latter end of the year. And we knew that we needed to start working on deepening relationships with these brokers. So I feel good about that. But that means that, that recruiting number will not be driven upward as steeply. And the decline that you see in that recruited number is driven by primarily by the broker recruits. Now from the career perspective, we will continue to work in increasing the number of career recruits. Our goal there was to initially increase the number of district sales coordinators because in our field force, those are the field hierarchy of the coordinators who actually trained those new recruits. And we have increased the number of districts by 15% [ph]. And so we are now seeing an increase in recruits as well for the second quarter, it's around 3% -- 2.6% is what we're seeing an increase in recruits.
So we have strategies, certainly, to continue to increase recruiting. But our philosophy has changed somewhat on the broker side. We do know that lower recruiting does not mean lower sales at this point in time because the broker business is growing and we're pleased with that."

Things came in, as I said, at or somewhat better than planned in most particular areas. I always liked to say, we've got a lot of moving parts in this organization. And I have to expect some good variances from plan and some that are maybe not quite as favorable. But net-net, the things that move from plan netted out to be on track. I will say that we had frontloaded expenses, both in Japan and the U.S., this year relative to where they were in the prior year, at least on a comparative basis. In the U.S., it was all continuing buildout of the change in the sales management model and the like. In Japan, we had planned to do some additional work in our IT areas in terms of building out some of the systems we're working on and the like. And of course, we ended up with that relatively modest write-down of some of the software development costs we have previously incurred. To tell you, there's a lot of moving parts on that software development cost thing. We're going to get a credit from the vendor that participated in doing that software development that will benefit us in subsequent periods, credit somewhere between at least half of the amount of the write-down and we have some optionality in terms of when to take advantage of those credits. But all that being said, we had a good solid first six months. We think we'll be on plan or better for Japan and U.S. benefits in the second 6 months. We're ahead of plan, to some extent, in net investment income. And of course, we did the bond transaction to take out the 8% notes that we had outstanding, took them out and the combination of first and second quarter, eliminated $850 [ph] million of bonds that carried an 8% coupon, replaced them with about $1 billion of debt that carried much lower net affected coupon rates and that's going to save us about $0.07 a share or a little bit over 1% of increase in the EPS during the period. So all those things netted together, I mean, the increase in guidance wasn't huge, but it was an upward revision to indicate that we had a good plan for the year and we have confidence we're going to make it during the second part of the year. Good sales help that too. So that's about it from my perspective. I don't know, Dan, if you want to add anything to that. But that's the financial story. I'll let you follow-up if you want to."

That's led us to being cautious and disciplined relative to our sales practices. Today's interest rates, we're looking at mid-single digit profitability as a percent of premium on the WAYS business produced today, if those low interest rates continue on for the full premium period of the policy. As Paul mentioned, we extended the premium period for the new version of WAYS from pretty much a 10-year minimum to the 15-year minimum. That produces lower premium rate in each year. We collect the premium, it gives us a longer period of time to yen averaged our dollar average invested interest rates. During that time we received the cash from the product. And today's interest rates, again, historic lows. If those persist throughout the premium period of the policy, we expect to come in mid-single digits, which is not really consistent with our company objective.

Colin, I'll say that the financial guys look at increasing profitability more than they look at increasing premiums in-force. And some of that is a discipline. We've had input on from the investment community over the last several years, 2010, '11 and '12, we're in a lot of first sector premium. In my opinion, it had good profit margin. I'm convinced we added significantly to the value of enterprise and grew our profits, it was first sector product, but we had a lot of pushback from the investment, saying we don't want you to grow those large premium policies, those investment-oriented products. So it wasn't solely that input that caused us to pushback but it was partly that input that caused us the pushback some in the first sector. And so we reemphasized our core business third sector products that cover the body, instead of being investment-oriented or Life Insurance oriented more. And we're concentrating on growing that and I think redirecting the efforts of our distribution system. The third sector is leading to significant increases in growth. Now the fact of the matter is you've got a certain persistency or lapse rate that's just associated with the market and you lose a certain amount of business through lapses. And your net gross based on how much new production you can have that also the lapses in-force. And as you get bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of your legacy block, now the lapses become bigger and more new business is required. So we've got a balancing act going on, Colin. But our final focus is on enhancing profitability and value of the company for the shareholders. I don't worry quite as much about the metric of premiums in-force as I do profit growth. So I'm going to leave it there and let you pushback if you want."

That was it for the second quarter on an operating basis. And darn, one thing we determined when we were interviewing CFO candidates is every person we interviewed told us that one thing that attracted them to talking to us was our profitability metrics and our return metrics. Our margin metrics, our ROE metrics, they say, gosh, my company sits around and lusts after your metrics and it's really attractive situation. I'm sensitive to what you're saying about ROE declines. And quite frankly, the first sector business, if it produces a mid-single digit profit margin, that's going to carry a lower ROE, and I admit that. But that's not where we want to end up ultimately. But I think we'll maintain the operating ROEs, our internal range is to hit somewhere in the 16 [ph] to 24 [ph] range. That's where we get paid on. So that's what we're managing for.

First, we want to drive those core valuation metrics north where we can and if we can. But interestingly enough, what I think is also happening over the last several years for Aflac is our cost of equity is coming down, as the company has gotten bigger, stronger, stable and quite honestly, I'm looking across the table and of course, Eric has grabbed onto the general account and managed the risk more carefully around the exposures we have, the volatility and prospects of volatility for the company are down, down considerably. And so I think ROE may have trickled down over time, but certainly, cost of equity has also come down and we're still generating the kind of value that you would expect. And I would second that Chris is talking about in part some comments I made when I was first talking to the company. 
Well it's true though but the interesting about that is that it goes back to Dan comments on M&A. The bar is extremely higher at Aflac because right now, when we buy back our stock, we're effectively buying back into a higher returning company at 0 premium. And that's a very valuable thing to do. And when we look at deploying excess capital build off and wins over buy when you're looking at a premium. And really, what we're excited about is driving more competition for investing organically in our growth model. And that's a very promising thing when you're driving good returns. So it's -- we're in a good position, I think all the way around."

They're very similar between the first and third sector products. And certainly, some percentage of the calls are in fact variable. But the way we manage cost, particularly within Aflac Japan is, I'll say independent of the source of the production et cetera, et cetera. Our staffing models are built around certain things. And we don't have a lot of fluctuation in personnel or staffing levels over, say, a 6-month period. We'll adjust depending on trends and the like. But I can pretty much count on the Aflac Japan management team to come in with their expense plan we established at the beginning of the year. And one of the ways I've disciplined that expense plan is by setting the growth in their general operating expenses, generally at about an increased level of about half the increase in the premium income. That's my objective. That's where I've always start out with them. And so that adds some discipline to the process. It gives them variability and the premiums vary, expense targets vary. But in general, more of our costs are step in nature and not directly variable. So that tends to lead to some stability of profits regardless of variations and production over a short span of time, which I'd say is 6 months or so."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that the sales of the third quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second",1009,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. 
I am extremely pleased that the sales of the third quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second quarter and 23.3% year-to-date. In addition to continued strong sales of our cancer insurance, the new medical product we introduced last month has proven to be very attractive in what has become a very competitive market.
From a distribution standpoint, Aflac Japan generated positive sales growth from all of our sales channels, which lets us know we're focused in the right direction. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions, and these results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.
Keep in mind that Aflac Japan's fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. Given strong third sector sales growth in the first half of the year and the positive reception to the enhanced medical product, we now anticipate that sales of third sector products will increase between 7% to 10% for the full year. This is much stronger than our original expectation and impressive, given that our already leading market share position in the third sector products.
Now let me turn to our U.S. operation. I am encouraged that the second quarter sales improved over the first quarter results. And I believe that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure last year are setting the stage for bigger and better sales opportunities. Additionally, One Day Pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels, accounts and policyholders. Through the industry-leading claims initiative, we're able to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. This allows us to deliver on our promise to our policyholders, even more meaningfully by getting cash in their hands faster than ever. We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the parameters of this initiative. Along with our strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to underscore the value of Aflac's products and ultimately help Aflac sales long term.
At the same time, 2015 continues to be a year of building in Aflac Group. We are making progress with advancing our relationships and our potential business opportunities through insurance brokers and larger case market. As our production through broker and larger employers grows, we anticipate that sales will be driven progressively toward the fourth quarter, which will magnify the seasonal pattern of our sales to a certain extent. We continue to concentrate our efforts on increasing Aflac U.S. sales 3% to 7% for the year. 
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top of mind with the shareholders, and that's capital deployment. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders. We continue to believe our capital strength puts us in an excellent position to repatriate approximately JPY 200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015, which continues to reinforce our plan to repurchase $1.3 billion of the common stock in 2015 and places us in a good position for the next year as well. 
As I've said at the Financial Analyst Briefing in May, we believe that over the next few years, all else equal, we will have opportunities to increase the capital available for deployment. Let me reiterate that our strong bias is, first, to continue with our strong record of dividend growth, followed by repurchasing of our stock and third, disciplined investment in organic growth initiatives.
With the first half of the year complete, I'm pleased with the company's results. We have upwardly revised our target for 2015 operating earnings per diluted share to now be in the range of 4% to 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Historically, the majority of the expenses have skewed more toward the end of the year, however, we have expedited some of the spending in the first half of the year and now believe expenses should lessen in the latter part of the year.
Of note, some of the expense acceleration is driving strong growth rates and we are experiencing in Japan, and expect to experience in the United States. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objective while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. 
Now let me turn to a topic I know you're eager to hear about. As most of you know, Fred Crawford has joined the Aflac team at the end of June as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At our Analyst Meeting in May, I've shared how important it was that we bring in someone who not only has a new perspective, but who as a leader also enriches our corporate culture. Ultimately, the corporate culture of our organization is a very important factor of leadership because it helps define the company's common goals, objectives and standard of behavior that employees have come to count on. 
Throughout Fred's 3 decades of financial leadership experience, he's consistently demonstrated that he possesses the characteristics that we've been looking for, and we believe he is the right man for the job. Let me just say that he's off to a tremendous start at Aflac in terms of overseeing the financial management of the company's operations, including global investments.
As you know, Chris is continuing his duties as President of the corporation. In addition, he's working closely with Fred as he transitions to Aflac.

First, let me say I've been both privileged and blessed to have held the CFO responsibility at Aflac for the last 23 years. And I look forward to continuing to serve Aflac and all of its stakeholders, including the investment community, as President of Aflac Incorporated at the pleasure of Dan and the board. I've always wanted to transition my CFO duties at a time when Aflac is financially strong. And today, looking at our capital position and our earnings process -- prospects, I certainly believe that to be the case.
I'm pleased we were able to upwardly revise our EPS guidance for 2015, we've performed at or better than expected for the first 6 months and our outlook for the full year is more favorable than our original estimates. Accordingly, I believe Fred is joining us at a good time and I'm enjoying working with him as he transitions to his new responsibilities. And let me tell you that Dan and I were immediately impressed with Fred during our interview process. We believe his breadth and depth of experience, as well as his exposure to the financial challenges that the industry faces, gives him a perspective that will significantly benefit Aflac. But equally important to us was Fred's history as an active partner with his previous CEOs. I have complete confidence that Fred will capitalize on those experiences and fully meet our expectations of him as Aflac's next CFO. 
So with that build up, let me turn it over to Fred for a few comments."

Let me start by also thanking the entire management team here at Aflac for welcoming me to the Aflac family, and particularly Dan and Chris, who have built out a very comprehensive transition plan for me into the new CFO role. It's a real privilege to be here. 
Ever since I started with the company nearly a month ago, it's been a whirlwind of meetings and activities directed towards gaining a deep understanding of the operations, our strategy, key initiatives and, of course, the key financial drivers. 
I've had an opportunity to spend a productive week in Japan. I also attended a sales force meeting in the U.S. and countless briefing sessions at various -- with various areas of the organization, especially on matters related to driving growth, valuation and efficient capital management. 
It's clear to me that here at Aflac, we have a very high-caliber level of people who are dedicated, compassionate and who genuinely love what they do. I've joined the company at a particularly good time, as the strategic planning process is underway and the 2016 financial planning process begins.
I will understandably play a more limited role on this call. But as I immerse myself in operations, investments and the financial details, I look forward to sharing their perspectives with you in the future periods. 
I can assure you that under Dan and Kriss' leadership, the team is laser-focused on driving growth, effectively deploying and delivering capital back to our shareholders and leveraging our platform here in the U.S. and Japan. So with that, I'm very excited to be here and I look forward to more opportunities to interact with all of you. And I'll hand it back to Robin. Robin?"

I'd like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning, starting first with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 15.7%. In reference to top line in y",603,"Okay. Thank you, Fred, and welcome. I'd like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning, starting first with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 15.7%. In reference to top line in yen terms, revenues as reported were flat for the quarter. Excluding the impact of the yen, revenues declined 1.4%. 
In terms of the quarterly operating ratios the benefits to total revenues declined slightly compared to last year, going from 60.6% to 60.5% in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would've been 61.3%. Reinsurance had 110 basis points positive impact on the benefit ratio in the quarter.
The expense ratio in the quarter increased to 18.4% from 17.7%. Expenses were, in large part, due to write-offs -- software development costs related to modernization activities, planned increase spending associated with upgrading of our system software in Japan and also promotional expenditures for our new medical product. 
The pretax profit margin declined slightly during the quarter, going from 21.7% to 21.1%. Excluding the impact of the yen, the pretax profit margin for the quarter would've been 20.1%. With the retraction of the margin, pretax earnings declined 3.1% in yen terms. Excluding the yen, pretax earnings would've been 8.9% -- would have declined 8.9%.
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S., where total revenues rose 1.9% for the quarter. And looking at the operating ratios, the benefit ratio was 47.7% compared to 48.1%. The primary reason for this improvement was the continued favorable claims experience. 
The operating expense ratio increased, going from 31.6% to 32.8%. This increase is the result of increased spending on the U.S. sales strategy as we've discussed before and is in line with our expectation.
Now looking at some of the other items. Noninsurance expense at corporate level were $38 million compared to $51 million a year ago. This decline reflects the impact of the extinguishment of the debt executed last quarter. Parent company and other expenses were $20 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of '14. 
On an operating basis, the corporate tax rate was 34.6% compared to 34.5% last year.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share before the yen impact were $1.64 compared to $1.66 a year ago. The weaker yen decreased operating earnings by $0.14 per diluted share for the quarter.
Lastly, let me comment and reiterate some of the statements Dan made. We have upwardly revised the target for our objectives for 2015 and now expect operating earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 4% to 7%. 
For the third quarter, if the yen averages JPY 120 to JPY 125, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.53 per diluted share. Using the same currency assumptions for the full year, we would expect to report EPS somewhere in the range of $5.88 or $6.17 per diluted share.
Before we take your questions, I'd like to take this opportunity to update everyone on a change to the timing of our earnings guidance practice. After careful consideration, we concluded the best practice would be to provide earnings guidance in December for the following year in the form of a dedicated outlook call. We believe this process better aligns us with the natural time line of our financial planning process. Additionally, this practice also puts us more in line with the guidance disclosure practices of many of our peers. 
Now we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question, please."

The recruiting number consist of both broker recruits and career agents. And on the broker side, we've purposefully reduced the number of recruits there because our goal is to strengthen and deepen the relationships that we have with our current brokers. We've hired 120 broker sales professionals, and our goal is to continue to earn the business of each of those brokerage houses and to help them to grow their business. Now -- and many of these are large brokerage houses that we have these relationships with. So we knew that the business would skew toward the latter end of the year and we knew that we needed to start working on deepening relationships with these brokers. So I feel good about that. But that means that, that recruiting number will not be driven upward as steeply. And the decline that you see in that recruited number is driven by -- primarily by the broker recruits. Now from the career perspective, we will continue to work in increasing the number of career recruits. Our goal there was to initially increase the number of district sales coordinators because in our field force, those are the field hierarchy of the coordinators who actually train those new recruits. And we have increased the number of districts by 16%. And so we are now seeing an increase in recruits as well for the second quarter. It's around 3% -- 2.6% is what we're seeing an increase in recruits.
So we have strategies, certainly, to continue to increase recruiting, but our philosophy has changed somewhat on the broker side. We do know that lower recruiting does not mean lower sales at this point in time because the broker business is growing, and we're pleased with that."

And we've got a lot of initiatives underway doing that, and that's where my focus is going to be, is understanding that and helping to interpret those strategies to how it matters to our financials and how it's expected to flow through.

But all that being said, we had a good solid first 6 months. We think we'll be on plan or better for Japan and U.S. benefits in the second 6 months. We're ahead of plan, to some extent, in net investment income. And of course, we did the bond transaction to take out the 8% notes that we had outstanding, took them out and the combination of first and second quarter, eliminated $850 million of bonds that carried an 8% coupon, replaced them with about $1 billion of debt that carried much lower net affected coupon rates, and that's going to save us about $0.07 a share or a little bit over 1% of increase in EPS during the period. So all those things netted together, I mean, the increase in guidance wasn't huge, but it was an upward revision to indicate that we had a good plan for the year and we have confidence we're going to make it during the second part of the year. Good sales help that, too. So that's about it from my perspective. I don't know, Dan, if you want to add anything to that, but that's the financial story. I'll let you follow-up if you want to."

And one large portion of those cash flows was, again, you'll recollect we had the flash crash of October 15 last year. We sold about $1.2 billion of treasuries, but we opted to put that back into yen or JTBs because we didn't like the dollar opportunity at that time. We planned to bring that back to dollars during '15, but we wanted to opportunistic. So not knowing exactly when that would be, that was planned for July 1. As you know, during the second quarter, the 10-year started at about 190 or 180 or so, ended the quarter around 240 and early June, hit around 245, 250. We opted to take about 2/3 of that money and allocated in June, mostly to some investment-grade corporate bonds and a little bit of high-yield. So we were opportunistic in terms of the timing, plans for but we did a little earlier than we had originally put in the budget of July. So that was the big driver of that new money yields. And as I had said last quarter, we expected over the year, this would iron out the first quarter was just because we focused primarily with the small amount we had on JGBs, but we'd always planned on having a larger dollar allocation. So I hope that helps."

But through and through our bank channel, we continue to monitor in cap sales of first sector products. But as our exclusive agencies depend solely on Aflac for their products, and they continue to do a great job, creating cross-selling between first sector sales and third sector sales, we continue to work with them to develop products that we think can meet our needs as well as meet the needs of growing our third sector sales in Japan.

That's led us to being cautious and disciplined relative to our sales practices. Today's interest rates, we're looking at mid-single digit profitability as a percent of premium on the WAYS business produced today if those low interest rates continue on for the full premium period of the policy. As Paul mentioned, we extended the premium period for the new version of WAYS from pretty much a 10-year minimum to the 15-year minimum. That produces over a premium rate. In each year, we collect a premium. It gives us a longer period of time to yen average or dollar average invested interest rates during that time we received the cash from the product. And today's interest rates, again, historic lows. If those persist throughout the premium period of the policy, we expect to come in mid-single digits, which is not really consistent with our company objective. We're optimistic or hopeful that interest rates will improve somewhat over time and we'll get the benefit of investing some of the future cash flows at somewhat higher interest rates, but that remains to be seen. All that being said, we do believe that it's in our corporate interest to maintain the agency relationships with the channel that we've developed to continue to promote the cross-sell of third sector products, which we're pretty good at, and just monitor conditions as we continue to accept business. So not a rosy picture at current interest rates, but we're trying to just keep the distribution system afloat at this point."

Colin, I'll say that the financial guys look at increasing profitability more than they look at increasing premiums in-force, and some of that is a discipline. We've had input on from the investment community. Over the last several years, 2010, '11 and '12, we wrote a lot of first sector premium. In my opinion, it had good profit margin. I'm convinced we added significantly to the value of enterprise and grew our profits with first sector products. But we got a lot of pushback from the investment saying, ""We don't want you to grow those large premium policies. Those more investment-oriented products."" So it wasn't solely that input that caused us to push back but it was partly that input that caused us to push back some in the first sector. And so we've reemphasized our core business of third sector products that cover the body, instead of being investment-oriented or life insurance-oriented more. And we're concentrating on growing that and I think redirecting the efforts of our distribution system. The third sector is leading to significant increases in growth. Now the fact of the matter is you've got a certain persistency or lapse rate that's just associated with the market and you lose a certain amount of business through lapses. And your net grows based on how much new production you can have that offsets the lapses in-force. And as you get bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of your legacy block, the lapses become bigger and more new business is required. So we've got a balancing act going on, Colin. But our final focus is on enhancing profitability and value of the company for the shareholders. I don't worry quite as much about the metric of premiums in-force as I do profit growth. So I'm going to leave it there and let you push back, if you want."

All I know is we're in the far upper right-hand corner of every chart I ever see relative to companies producing ROEs. And right now, on an operating basis, excluding all the unrealized gains and losses and excluding the effect of currency, our ROEs are still in excess of 20%. I think they were like 23.1% or something like that. That was the number. I happen to remember that number because I kind of like those ROEs. That was it for the second quarter on an operating basis. And darn, one thing we determined when we were interviewing CFO candidates is every person we interviewed told us that one thing that attracted us -- them to talking to us was our profitability metrics and our return metrics. Our margin metrics, our ROE metrics, they say, ""Gosh, my company sits around and lusts after your metrics,"" and it's really attractive situation. So I'm sensitive to what you're saying about ROE declines. And quite frankly, the first sector business, if it produces a mid-single digit profit margin, that's going to carry a lower ROE, and I admit that but that's not where we want to end up ultimately. But I think we'll maintain the operating ROEs, our internal range is to hit somewhere in the 16% to 24% range. That's what we get paid on. So that's what we're managing for. And quite frankly, 20% is our target, minimum target. And if we don't get that, we get penalized financially. So that's where I'm trying to keep things."

First, we always want to drive those core valuation metrics north, where we can and if we can. But interestingly enough, what I think has also happened over the last several years for Aflac is our cost of equity is coming down as the company has gotten bigger, stronger, stable and quite honestly, I'm looking across the table at Eric Kirsch because Eric has grabbed on to the general account and managed the risk more carefully around the exposures we have. The volatility and prospects of volatility for the company are down -- down considerably. And so I think ROE may have trickled down over time but certainly, cost of equity has also come down, too, while we're still generating the kind of value that you would expect. And I would second that Kriss is talking about, in part, some comments I made when I was first talking with the company."

They're very similar between first and third sector products. And certainly, some percentage of the costs are in fact variable. But the way we manage costs, particularly within Aflac Japan, is I'll say independent of the source of the production, et cetera, et cetera. Our staffing models are built around certain things. And we don't have a lot of fluctuation in personnel or staffing levels over, say, a 6-month period. We'll adjust depending on trends and the like. But I can pretty much count on the Aflac Japan management team to come in with their expense plan we established at the beginning of the year. And one of the ways I've disciplined that expense plan is by setting the growth in their general operating expenses, generally at about an increased level of about half the increase in the premium income. That's my objective. That's where I always start out with them. And so that adds some discipline to the process. It gives them some variability in the premiums. If premiums vary, I let their expense targets vary. But in general, more of our costs are step in nature and not directly variable. So that tends to lead to some stability of profits regardless of variations in production over a short span of time, which I'd say is 6 months or so."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that the sales of the third quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second",1011,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. 
I am extremely pleased that the sales of the third quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second quarter and 23.3% year-to-date. In addition to continued strong sales of our cancer insurance, the new medical product we introduced last month has proven to be very attractive in what has become a very competitive market.
From a distribution standpoint, Aflac Japan generated positive sales growth from all of our sales channels, which lets us know we're focused in the right direction. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions, and these results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.
Keep in mind that Aflac Japan's fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. Given strong third sector sales growth in the first half of the year and the positive reception to the enhanced medical product, we now anticipate that sales of third sector products will increase between 7% to 10% for the full year. This is much stronger than our original expectation and impressive, given that [ph] our already leading market share position in the third sector products.
Now let me turn to our U.S. operation. I am encouraged that the second quarter sales improved over the first quarter results. And I believe that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure last year are setting the stage for bigger and better sales opportunities. Additionally, One Day Pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels, accounts and policyholders. Through the industry-leading claims initiative, we're able to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. This allows us to deliver on our promise to our policyholders, even more meaningfully by getting cash in their hands faster than ever. We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the parameters of this initiative. Along with our strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to underscore the value of Aflac's products and ultimately help Aflac sales long term.
At the same time, 2015 continues to be a year of building in Aflac Group. We are making progress with advancing our relationships and our potential business opportunities through insurance brokers and larger case market. As our production through broker and larger employers grows, we anticipate that sales will be driven progressively toward the fourth quarter, which will magnify the seasonal pattern of our sales to a certain extent. We continue to concentrate our efforts on increasing Aflac U.S. sales 3% to 7% for the year. 
Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top of mind with the shareholders, and that's capital deployment. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders. We continue to believe our capital strength puts us in an excellent position to repatriate approximately JPY 200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015, which continues to reinforce our plan to repurchase $1.3 billion of the common stock in 2015 and places us in a good position for the next year as well. 
As I've said at the Financial Analyst Briefing in May, we believe that over the next few years, all else equal, we will have opportunities to increase the capital available for deployment. Let me reiterate that our strong bias is, first, to continue with our strong record of dividend growth, followed by repurchasing of our stock and third, disciplined investment in organic growth initiatives.
With the first half of the year complete, I'm pleased with the company's results. We have upwardly revised our target for 2015 operating earnings per diluted share to now be in the range of 4% to 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Historically, the majority of the expenses have skewed more toward the end of the year, however, we have expedited some of the spending in the first half of the year and now believe expenses should lessen in the latter part of the year.
Of note, some of the expense acceleration is driving strong growth rates and [ph] we are experiencing in Japan, and expect to experience in the United States. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objective while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. 
Now let me turn to a topic I know you're eager to hear about. As most of you know, Fred Crawford has joined the Aflac team at the end of June as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At our Analyst Meeting in May, I shared how important it was that we bring in someone who not only has a new perspective, but who, as a leader, also enriches our corporate culture. Ultimately, the corporate culture of our organization is a very important factor of leadership because it helps define the company's common goals, objectives and standard of behavior that employees have come to count on. 
Throughout Fred's 3 decades of financial leadership experience, he's consistently demonstrated that he possesses the characteristics that we've been looking for, and we believe he is the right man for the job. Let me just say that he's off to a tremendous start at Aflac in terms of overseeing the financial management of the company's operations, including global investments.
As you know, Kriss is continuing his duties as President of the corporation. In addition, he's working closely with Fred as he transitions to Aflac. Fred has also been rolling up his sleeves and I can tell you that he fits right in to Aflac. Fred, we're glad to have you. Now Kriss is going to say a few words about the transition, followed by Fred, who will then turn it back over to Robin. Kriss?"

Ever since I started with the company nearly a month ago, it's been a whirlwind of meetings and activities directed towards gaining a deep understanding of the operations, our strategy, key initiatives and, of course, the key financial drivers.

It's clear to me that here at Aflac, we have a very high-caliber level of people who are dedicated, compassionate and who genuinely love what they do. I've joined the company at a particularly good time, as the strategic planning process is underway and the 2016 financial planning process begins.
I will understandably play a more limited role on this call. But as I immerse myself in operations, investments and the financial details, I look forward to sharing my perspectives with you in the future periods. 
I can assure you that under Dan and Kriss' leadership, the team is laser-focused on driving growth, effectively deploying and delivering capital back to our shareholders and leveraging our platform here in the U.S. and Japan.

250178,281476059,842109,"AFLAC Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Fred, and welcome. I'd like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning, starting first with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 15.7%. In reference to top line in y",605,"Okay. Thank you, Fred, and welcome. I'd like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning, starting first with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 15.7%. In reference to top line in yen terms, revenues as reported were flat for the quarter. Excluding the impact of the yen, revenues declined 1.4%. 
In terms of the quarterly operating ratios, the benefits to total revenues declined slightly compared to last year, going from 60.6% to 60.5% in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would've been 61.3%. Reinsurance had 110 basis points positive impact on the benefit ratio in the quarter.
The expense ratio in the quarter increased to 18.4% from 17.7%. Expenses were, in large part, due to write-offs -- software development costs related to modernization activities, planned increased spending associated with upgrading of our system software in Japan and also promotional expenditures for our new medical product. 
The pretax profit margin declined slightly during the quarter, going from 21.7% to 21.1%. Excluding the impact of the yen, the pretax profit margin for the quarter would've been 20.1%. With the retraction of the margin, pretax earnings declined 3.1% in yen terms. Excluding the yen, pretax earnings would've been 8.9% -- would have declined 8.9%.
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S., where total revenues rose 1.9% for the quarter. And looking at the operating ratios, the benefit ratio was 47.7% compared to 48.1%. The primary reason for this improvement was the continued favorable claims experience. 
The operating expense ratio increased, going from 31.6% to 32.8%. This increase is the result of increased spending on the U.S. sales strategy as we've discussed before and is in line with our expectation.
Now looking at some of the other items. Noninsurance expense at the corporate level were $38 million compared to $51 million a year ago. This decline reflects the impact of the extinguishment of the debt executed last quarter. Parent company and other expenses were $20 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of '14. 
On an operating basis, the corporate tax rate was 34.6% compared to 34.5% last year.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share before the yen impact were $1.64 compared to $1.66 a year ago. The weaker yen decreased operating earnings by $0.14 per diluted share for the quarter.
Lastly, let me comment and reiterate some of the statements that Dan made. We have upwardly revised the target for our objectives for 2015 and now expect operating earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 4% to 7%. 
For the third quarter, if the yen averages JPY 120 to JPY 125, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.53 per diluted share. Using the same currency assumptions for the full year, we would expect to report EPS somewhere in the range of $5.88 or $6.17 per diluted share.
Before we take your questions, I'd like to take this opportunity to update everyone on a change to the timing of our earnings guidance practice. After careful consideration, we concluded the best practice would be to provide earnings guidance in December for the following year in the form of a dedicated outlook call. We believe this process better aligns us with the natural time line of our financial planning process. Additionally, this practice also puts us more in line with the guidance disclosure practices of many of our peers. 
Now we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question, please."

The recruiting number consists of both broker recruits and career agents. And on the broker side, we've purposefully reduced the number of recruits there because our goal is to strengthen and deepen the relationships that we have with our current brokers. We've hired 120 broker sales professionals, and our goal is to continue to earn the business of each of those brokerage houses and to help them to grow their business. Now -- and many of these are large brokerage houses that we have these relationships with. So we knew that the business would skew toward the latter end of the year and we knew that we needed to start working on deepening relationships with these brokers. So I feel good about that. But that means that, that recruiting number will not be driven upward as steeply. And the decline that you see in that recruited number is driven by -- primarily by the broker recruits. Now from the career perspective, we will continue to work in increasing the number of career recruits. Our goal there was to initially increase the number of district sales coordinators because in our field force, those are the field hierarchy of the coordinators who actually train those new recruits. And we have increased the number of districts by 16%. And so we are now seeing an increase in recruits as well for the second quarter. It's around 3% -- 2.6% is what we're seeing in increase in recruits.
So we have strategies, certainly, to continue to increase recruiting, but our philosophy has changed somewhat on the broker side. We do know that lower recruiting does not mean lower sales at this point in time because the broker business is growing, and we're pleased with that."

Things came in, as I said, at or somewhat better than plan in most particular areas. I always liked to say, we've got a lot of moving parts in this organization. And I have to expect some good variances from plan and some that are maybe not quite as favorable. But net-net, the things that moved from plan netted out to be on track. I will say that we had front-loaded expenses, both in Japan and the U.S., this year relative to where they were in the prior year, at least on a comparative basis. In the U.S., it was all continuing build-out of the change in the sales management model and the like. In Japan, we had planned to do some additional work in our IT areas in terms of building out some of the systems we're working on and the like. And of course, we ended up with that relatively modest write-down of some of the software development costs we had previously incurred. To tell you, there's a lot of moving parts on that software development cost thing. We're going to get a credit from the vendor that participated in doing that software development that will benefit us in subsequent periods, credit somewhere between at least half of the amount of the write-down and we have some optionality in terms of when to take advantage of those credits. But all that being said, we had a good solid first 6 months. We think we'll be on plan or better for Japan and U.S. benefits in the second 6 months. We're ahead of plan, to some extent, in net investment income. And of course, we did the bond transaction to take out the 8% notes that we had outstanding, took them out and the combination of first and second quarter eliminated $850 million of bonds that carried an 8% coupon, replaced them with about $1 billion of debt that carried much lower net affected coupon rates, and that's going to save us about $0.07 a share or a little bit over 1% of increase in EPS during the period. So all those things netted together, I mean, the increase in guidance wasn't huge, but it was an upward revision to indicate that we had a good plan for the year and we have confidence we're going to make it during the second part of the year. Good sales helped that, too. So that's about it from my perspective. I don't know, Dan, if you want to add anything to that, but that's the financial story. I'll let you follow-up if you want to."

A big driver of that was, as you'll recollect, I talked about earlier in the year, that most of our cash flows were back-ended in the second half of the year. And one large portion of those cash flows was, again, you'll recollect we had the flash crash of October 15 last year. We sold about $1.2 billion of treasuries, but we opted to put that back into yen or JGBs because we didn't like the dollar opportunity at that time. We planned to bring that back to dollars during '15, but we wanted to be opportunistic. So not knowing exactly when that would be, that was planned for July 1. As you know, during the second quarter, the 10-year started at about 190 or 180 or so, ended the quarter around 240 and early June, hit around 245, 250. We opted to take about 2/3 of that money and allocate it in June, mostly to some investment-grade corporate bonds and a little bit of high-yield. So we were opportunistic in terms of the timing planned for, but we did a little earlier than we had originally put in the budget of July. So that was the big driver of that new money yield. And as I had said last quarter, we expected over the year that this would iron out. The first quarter was just because we focused primarily with the small amount we had on JGBs, but we'd always planned on having a larger dollar allocation. So I hope that helps."

And finally, as we've discussed, or I've discussed at FAB, as an accommodation to our agency sales force, keep in mind, several of our large channels don't even offer first sector generally, whether it's Daido, Dai-ichi or Japan Post. But through and through our bank channel, we continue to monitor and cap sales of first sector products. But as our exclusive agencies depend solely on Aflac for their products, and they continue to do a great job creating cross-selling between first sector sales and third sector sales, we continue to work with them to develop products that we think can meet our needs as well as meet the needs of growing our third sector sales in Japan.

That's led us to being cautious and disciplined relative to our sales practices. At today's interest rates, we're looking at mid-single digit profitability as a percent of premium on the WAYS business produced today if those low interest rates continue on for the full premium period of the policy. As Paul mentioned, we extended the premium period for the new version of WAYS from pretty much a 10-year minimum to a 15-year minimum. That produces over a premium rate in each year we collect a premium. It gives us a longer period of time to yen average or dollar average invested interest rates during the time we receive the cash from the product. And at today's interest rates, again, historic lows. If those persist throughout the premium period of the policy, we expect to come in mid-single digits, which is not really consistent with our company objective. We're optimistic or hopeful that interest rates will improve somewhat over time and we'll get the benefit of investing some of the future cash flows at somewhat higher interest rates, but that remains to be seen. All that being said, we do believe that it's in our corporate interest to maintain the agency relationships with the channel that we've developed to continue to promote the cross-sale of third sector products, which we're pretty good at, and just monitor conditions as we continue to accept business. So it's not a rosy picture at current interest rates, but we're trying to just keep the distribution system afloat at this point."

Colin, I'll say that the financial guys look at increasing profitability more than they look at increasing premiums in-force, and some of that is a discipline we've had input on from the investment community. Over the last several years, 2010, '11 and '12, we wrote a lot of first sector premium. In my opinion, it had good profit margin. I'm convinced we added significantly to the value of the enterprise and grew our profits with first sector products. But we got a lot of pushback from the investment community saying, ""We don't want you to grow those large premium policies. Those more investment-oriented products."" So it wasn't solely that input that caused us to push back but it was partly that input that caused us to push back some in the first sector. And so we've reemphasized our core business of third sector products that cover the body, instead of being investment-oriented or life insurance-oriented more. And we're concentrating on growing that. And I think redirecting the efforts of our distribution system to third sector is leading to significant increases in growth. Now the fact of the matter is you've got a certain persistency or lapse rate that's just associated with the market and you lose a certain amount of business through lapses. And your net gross based on how much new production you can have that offsets the lapses in-force. And as you get bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of your legacy block, the lapses become bigger and more new business is required. So we've got a balancing act going on, Colin. But our final focus is on enhancing profitability and value of the company for the shareholders. I don't worry quite as much about the metric of premiums in-force as I do profit growth. So I'm going to leave it there and let you push back, if you want."

All I know is we're in the far upper right-hand corner of every chart I ever see relative to companies producing ROEs. And right now, on an operating basis, excluding all the unrealized gains and losses and excluding the effect of currency, our ROEs are still in excess of 20%. I think they were like 23.1% or something like that. That was the number. I happen to remember that number because I kind of like those ROEs. That was it for the second quarter on an operating basis. And darn, one thing we determined when we were interviewing CFO candidates is every person we interviewed told us that one thing that attracted us -- them to talking to us was our profitability metrics and our return metrics. Our margin metrics, our ROE metrics, they say, ""Gosh, my company sits around and lusts after your metrics,"" and it's a really attractive situation. So I'm sensitive to what you're saying about ROE declines. And quite frankly, the first sector business, if it produces a mid-single-digit profit margin, that's going to carry a lower ROE, and I admit that but that's not where we want to end up ultimately. But I think we'll maintain the operating ROEs, our internal range is to hit somewhere in the 16% to 24% range. That's what we get paid on. So that's what we're managing for. And quite frankly, 20% is our target, minimum target. And if we don't get that, we get penalized financially. So that's where I'm trying to keep things."

First, we always want to drive those core valuation metrics north, where we can and if we can. But interestingly enough, what I think has also happened over the last several years for Aflac is our cost of equity has come down. As the company has gotten bigger, stronger, stable and quite honestly, I'm looking across the table at Eric Kirsch because Eric has grabbed on to the general account and managed the risk more carefully around the exposures we have. The volatility and prospects of volatility for the company are down -- down considerably. And so I think ROE may have trickled down over time but certainly, cost of equity has also come down, too, where we're still generating the kind of value that you would expect. And I would second that Kriss is talking about, in part, some comments I made when I was first talking with the company."

They're very similar between first and third sector products. And certainly, some percentage of the costs are in fact variable. But the way we manage costs, particularly within Aflac Japan, is I'll say independent of the source of the production, et cetera, et cetera. Our staffing models are built around certain things. And we don't have a lot of fluctuation in personnel or staffing levels over, say, a 6-month period. We'll adjust depending on trends and the like. But I can pretty much count on the Aflac Japan management team to come in with their expense plan we established at the beginning of the year. And one of the ways I've disciplined that expense plan is by setting the growth in their general operating expenses, generally at about an increase level of about half the increase in the premium income. That's my objective. That's where I always start out with them. And so that adds some discipline to the process. It gives them some variability in the premiums. If premiums vary, I let their expense targets vary. But in general, more of our costs are step in nature and not directly variable. So that tends to lead to some stability of profits regardless of variations in production over a short span of time, which I'd say is 6 months or so."

250178,281476102,883883,"AFLAC Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Yes, thank you, Robin.

Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor Jupiter. I'm extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third quarter and 27.1% year-to-date. Aflac Japan generated strong sales results from all of our sales channels, which confirms that we focused on the right facets of our business. We also continue to work closely with Japan Post to enhance our partnership as demonstrated by the recently announced initiative to foster enhanced communications with the growing elderly population in Japan. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decision and our quarterly and year-to-date results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities. I want to remind you that Aflac Japan's 2014 fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. However, given the very strong sales results in the first 9 months and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are upwardly revising our sales growth target for the third sector products from the range of 7 to 10 to 10 to 13 for the full year. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. also performed very well in the quarter. Additionally, we have continued to receive phenomenal feedback from our distribution channels, our policyholders and accounts on One Day Pay, our industry-leading claims initiative. One Day Pay allows us to process a proven pay eligible claims in just 1 day. In particular, we're hearing from policyholders and consumers that our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment to delivering on our promise. That's enhancing our brand reputation and ultimately, opening even more doors for Aflac. We continue that estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect the number of claims processed within the One Day Pay will reach over 2 million people. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to drive home the value of Aflac's products and most importantly, it will help our sales long-term. 
Although our U.S. segments generated a slight increase in sales, I believe 2015 has been a year of building our business through our career and broker channels. Taking into account our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for sales for the quarter, we anticipate Aflac U.S. will generate sales growth at the lower end of the 3% to 7% range for the year. While it's been a year of building, I'm not satisfied with these results. In fact, I won't be satisfied until we see our sales growth more in the range of the mid-single digits, which I believe is reasonable and achievable. It is very difficult for us to make sales projections for the quarter or even for the year because around half of our sales will come in the last 5 weeks of the year. But I can tell you that the changes we made for management infrastructure over the last year are laying the groundwork for better long term sales. And we continue to invest on a platform to position us for growth. As we look to 2016, I think the groundwork we laid in 2015 has put us in a better position for 2016. Shortly, Fred will comment on the financial and capital deployment but let me just say that I'm pleased with the actions about the Board of Directors to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 5.1%. This marks the 33rd consecutive year of increasing cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Let me leave you with this thought. You've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year just as we have in the past and I believe that we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promise to our policyholders and returning significant capital to our owners. Now, I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter. Added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quart",876,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter. Added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quarter. Our third quarter results came in at the high end up our earnings guidance. Along with solid overall results, there are 2 earnings items that contributed to our better-than-expected performance. The first item was in Japan where we continue to see overall favorable claims trends. While we review our IBNR every quarter, we take a more comprehensive annual look at trends and claims studies in the third and fourth quarter. Reflecting on our favorable claims experience this year and as a result of this review, we concluded it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.2 billion or roughly $35 million before taxes. We have not completed our year-end actuarial reviews but at this point, we do not see or anticipate any material fourth quarter adjustments. 
The second driver was in our U.S. business where we have been steadily improving our customer billing and collection procedures. These improvements have resulted in better collection experience and allowed us to refine our uncollected premium allowance estimate. The catch up portion of this adjustment helped improve our rate of earned premium growth of the quarter and contributed approximately $8 million to pretax earnings. While these items contributed approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the quarter's results, overall, our Japan and U.S. operations enjoyed solid margins with adjusted benefit ratios favorable to our expectations and as compared with last year's quarter. As we expected, expense ratios were modestly elevated as we continue to invest in our platforms to generate growth, namely IT and new product introduction in Japan and our distribution model in the U.S. 
Turning to investments, while we have been successful in defending net investment income, the overall low rate environment remains a clear headwind and shows no signs of abating. We have natural maturities and higher coupon investments that are running off with proceeds reinvested at lower yields. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support high returns compared to low yields in Japan and the U.S. We took a larger than normal impairment in the quarter involving our investment in Naviant Corp. Naviant is a publicly traded student loan administrator, formally part of Sallie Mae. While we don't believe that there are any near-term risk of default, the majority of these holdings are long dated and yen denominated with poor liquidity. As a result, these holdings trade at a deep discount. At roughly $0.50 on the dollar, we felt it prudent to take impairment. Note that the majority of these securities are held in our Japan portfolio and are rated below investment grade. As a result, any decline in value has been reflected for Japan SMR purposes for several quarters. The impairment has no material impact on our overall capital position and deployment plans. 
Turning to capital, we expect SMR and RBC ratios to remain strong. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and expect to fulfill our guidance of $1.3 billion in repurchases for the year. Our dividend increase is in line with our expectation for full-year 2015 operating earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of currency. I would note that despite continuing weakness in the yen, our excess capital position and stable view of capital generation supports the increase. 
Before I turn the call back over to Rob and for Q&A, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance. Our fourth quarter guidance simply solves for our full year 2015 EPS guidance range of $5.96 a share to $6.16 a share given our year-to-date results. As we look to the fourth quarter and proceed to our financial planning process, we see the following dynamics influence our performance. Recognizing the effect of our past reinsurance transactions in Japan, we see earned premium in Japan and the U.S. increasing in the low single digit range with stable persistency. We see core Japan and U.S. benefit ratios holding strong around current levels after normalizing for the Japan IBNR reduction in the quarter. The maturity of high yielding investments reinvested at lower new money rates will continue to pressure net investment income although modestly offset by a strategic asset allocation and recognizing a bias towards higher quality. The growth we are experiencing in Japan required disciplined investment in customer care, product and distribution expansion. We see the same dynamic evolving in the U.S. in order to drive more robust growth rates. Our strong capital position and deployment efforts will continue to provide support for EPS growth. Our capital generation is strong and we continue to explore the potential to release additional excess capital. Absent attractive alternatives, we expect to drive long-term value in repurchasing our stock. These dynamics are generally consistent with our performance in 2015 and we look forward to providing more detail on our December 3 outlook call. Thank you and I'll now turn the call back over to Robin to begin Q&A."

[Japanes",314,"Thank you, Paul. Let me add a few comments in Japanese. [Japanese] It trends that the business alliance at the JP he has referred to is very specific to Japan. As you know, Japan is an aging society and the families are becoming more nuclearized. [Japanese] So what the FFA or the society overall is really demanding of our insurance company is that we need to check up on what our policyholders, these older policyholders are still alive or not. [Foreign Language] And since as you know, Japan Post has its mail delivery network across Japan, what we like to do is to use their network to check up on our policyholders. [Foreign Language] And if you try to do everything on our own within Aflac, it is going to require a lot of work. However, with the cooperation with JP, we will be able to achieve the same purpose in a relatively easier manner. [Foreign Language] And 1 other points, this is probably more specific to Japan as well, is that for any notice that need to from an insurance company to policyholder has to be done by mail. [Foreign Language] However, when the policyholder changes their addresses, we will not know the new address until our policyholders tells us so. [Foreign Language] So in overall, it will lead to increasing the services to our customers because the JP, the post offices will know that our customers address have changed because they are delivering the postal mail to them and that would make it easier for us where the policyholders are. [Foreign Language] We do believe this is a great alliance because we are using the strength and while the JP does best in their way and we are making leverage out of what JP is doing and that will also benefit us and serve our policyholders as well. That's it for me."

Where my comments are coming from first, the adjustment in the quarter. Let's make sure we understand that. So this is an adjustment to the IBNR reserves related to our cancer business in Japan and more specifically, it was related to a subset of our IBNR that relates to what we characterize as tail related claims. So this will be longer duration claims or estimate of claims emerging typically longer than 3 years out. It's a relatively small portion of the total IBNR that we hold for cancer but it's 1 that periodically, as in at least once a year, we do a more thorough examination of in test based on the trends we've been seeing in recent years. And so, as you can see, our trends have been very good in the overall claims front and so when we put these reserves, these particular tail reserves under review, we comfortably determined that there was margin in those reserves and we should take them down. So that's the JPY 4.2 billion reduction that I referenced and then, I'm asking you to pull out,  if you will, to think about the benefit ratios going forward. So my comments on the stability of benefit ratios is to first recognize that we have multiple businesses as you know in Japan that have different benefit ratios and different benefit ratio and claims trends but overall, when we pile them all together and look at the overall Japan benefit ratio dynamic, we expect stability but stability in third sector, particularly as you pull out that IBNR in the cancer site."

But first, we monitor the sale of these products, first sector products very carefully because the returns on those products can be very sensitive to the interest rate environment as you point out but also your investment strategy backing these products. And so even though the interest rate environment is very low, it's always possible that our investment strategies and you've seen recently that particularly in the end the third quarter, we've been able to descend our new money rates and put money to work at relatively attractive levels albeit headwinds are definitely in the marketplace. And so they're very sensitive to that type of investment strategy. But more importantly, we've really made moves to really focus the type of product that we're selling to deemphasize lump sum premium or so-called dump in premium type product and also product that is sold particularly in the bank channel where it's more of a spreadsheet environment and a competitive landscape. Those things coupled with the interest rate in the investment market could make for volatile returns or challenging returns, and so we want to deemphasize that. Where we're emphasizing is the longer pay products which gives us more possibility of putting money to work at attractive levels. It also tends to attract more of a protection orientation versus investment orientation. And most importantly, it's being driven through the traditional channels which support cross sell activity and again, recognizing once you're in the cross sell activity, you're trying to look at the overall blended return on a household which includes the returns on these products plus third sector products. So we're monitoring it very carefully. You're absolutely right, there was a rise in our sales but it's largely coming through the traditional channel, largely coming from longer pay premium products and involving cross sell.

One thing I would comment on, Ryan, just in this quarter to be mindful of from a math perspective as I mentioned the premium collection of reduction in the allowance for uncollectible premium. Obviously, realize that pumps up the numerator,  if you will, and so that helps -- benefits both your benefit ratio and your expense ratio because your premium is  pumped up a little bit when you make that adjustment.

Certainly, as you watched JGB's grind down, that doesn't make a job and in easier in terms of generating yield but realized we've got the portfolio approach to backing these products which includes among other things, the dollar program, Eric's strategic asset allocation and so we take, somewhat of a blended strategic asset allocation portfolio yield approach if you will to the expected investment horizons. So for example, recently, we have seen treasuries and JGB's go down but spreads widen out the when you might he can be put the word actually, at the even more attractive levels us homes being careful in where you go with the market. So it's not quite as simple as pegging to JGB but certainly, as you JGB going down, you got to keep in mind 2 things; 1, obviously more of a challenged to invest that money but the other is as you're having gradually move towards lower assumptions for ongoing interest rates as it relates to pricing of the product and so you end up having a gradually less competitive product in the marketplace. This is really an industry thing, not an Aflac issue and so do you reach a point where it's just not much a value proposition for the client as you hoped, and as the overall market starts to get soft. So I think those are some of the dynamics but it's not a 1 for 1 tied to JGB, it's not quite that simple although directionally, certainly, doesn't help. Hey, one other thing I would say on third sector and some of the commentary around Japan Post. I mean, be mindful of the difference between growth rates and just having a much larger engine now as we start January 1 versus generally 1 of last year. I mean, the effect of the matter is we're just selling more volume of product even though the comparables maybe challenging. We have a net larger distribution engine that is driving simply more sales overall. So that growth rate really benefits you as you move forward and look particularly at premium gross rates, in your in-force growth rates and the overall economic value that you've driven. So they'll continue to be a growth in my view in terms of value even though you may occasionally look at comparables, comparable sales periods that don't look as attractive, particularly when you know the dynamic with this is that it jumped out at a very strong level which is not unusual when build up all the advertising and marketing investments to really launch it and that was the story in the fourth quarter of last year."

Realized that the mix of business can play a little bit with your benefit ratios and so we want to understand the mix of business in Japan, particularly third sector versus first sector and we want to understand some of the mix of business dynamics in the U.S. a little bit better. But we're not seeing things that suggest to us significant movement in those benefit ratios going forward. So we'll provide more a little more color on this on the outlook call.

But the other is what value you see in that household and that agent relationship going forward as you continue to develop new product to sell to your existing block of business and clients and new clients. The other thing to consider is that you have agents making a living off of rebuilding out of these households and the sale or potential sale of new product. And so it supports the growth of your agency force and stability and even retention and development of your agency force. And these are things that are difficult to put economics behind but we all know they drive embedded value. So that's where I come from when I use the term household is the support for the agency, the agency build-out, the ability to do cross sell and what might be the future present value future sales dynamics related to having develop more households. One of the things we kind of lead with in Japan is that we're in 1 of 4 households and when you start the conversation with that, that suggests there to be a lot of opportunity you can develop by simply being in that position and so it really benefits us."

I expect it to grow over time but to have a slower launch than we might have expected when we do a product and the previous product has already run its course.

250178,281476102,884270,"AFLAC Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Robin. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third",740,"Yes. Thank you, Robin. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third quarter and 27.1% year-to-date. Aflac Japan generated strong sales results from all of our sales channels, which confirms that we've focused on the right facets of our business.
We also continue to work closely with Japan Post to enhance our partnership as demonstrated by the recently announced initiative to foster enhanced communications with the growing elderly population in Japan. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions, and our quarterly and year-to-date results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.
I want to remind you that Aflac Japan's 2014 fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus, making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. However, given the very strong sales results in the first 9 months and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are upwardly revising our sales growth target for the third sector products from the range of 7% to 10% to 10% to 13% for the full year.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. also performed very well in the quarter. Additionally, we have continued to receive phenomenal feedback from our distribution channels, our policyholders and accounts on One Day Pay, our industry-leading claims initiative. One Day Pay allows us to process a proven pay eligible claims in just 1 day. In particular, we're hearing from policyholders and consumers that our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment delivering on our promise. That's enhancing our brand reputation and ultimately, opening even more doors for Aflac.
We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect the number of claims processed within the One Day Pay will reach over 2 million people. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to drive home the value of Aflac's products and most importantly, it will help our sales long term.
Although our U.S. segments generated a slight increase in sales, I believe 2015 has been a year of building our business through our career and broker channels. Taking into account our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for sales for the quarter, we anticipate Aflac U.S. will generate sales growth at the lower end of the 3% to 7% range for the year.
While it's been a year of building, I'm not satisfied with these results. In fact, I won't be satisfied until we see our sales growth more in the range of the mid-single digits, which I believe is reasonable and achievable.
It is very difficult for us to make sales projections for the quarter or even for the year because around half of our sales will come in the last 5 weeks of the year. But I can tell you that the changes we've made through our management infrastructure over the last year are laying the groundwork for better long-term sales per se [ph]. And we continue to invest in our platform to position us for growth. As we look to 2016, I think the groundwork we laid in 2015 has put us in a better position for 2016.
Shortly, Fred will comment on the financial and capital deployment, but let me just say that I'm pleased with the actions about the Board of Directors to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 5.1%. This marks the 33rd consecutive year of increasing cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
Let me leave you with this thought. You've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year, just as we have in the past. And I believe that we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promise to our policyholders and returning significant capital to our owners.
Now I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quart",865,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quarter.
Our third quarter results came in at the high end of our earnings guidance. Along with solid overall results, there are 2 earnings items that contributed to our better-than-expected performance. The first item was in Japan where we continue to see overall favorable claims trends. While we review our IBNR every quarter, we take a more comprehensive annual look at trends and claims studies in the third and fourth quarter. Reflecting on our favorable claims experience this year and as a result of this review, we concluded it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.2 billion or roughly $35 million before taxes. We have not completed our year-end actuarial reviews, but at this point, we do not see or anticipate any material fourth quarter adjustments.
The second driver was in our U.S. business where we have been steadily improving our customer billing and collection procedures. These improvements have resulted in better collection experience and allowed us to refine our uncollected premium allowance estimate. The catch-up portion of this adjustment helped improve our rate of earned premium growth in the quarter and contributed approximately $8 million to pretax earnings.
While these items contributed approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the quarter's results, overall, our Japan and U.S. operations enjoyed solid margins with adjusted benefit ratios favorable to our expectations and as compared with last year's quarter. As we expected, expense ratios were modestly elevated as we continue to invest in our platforms to generate growth, namely IT and new product introduction in Japan and our distribution model in the U.S.
Turning to investments. While we have been successful in defending net investment income, the overall low-rate environment remains a clear headwind and shows no signs of abating. We have natural maturities and higher-coupon investments that are running off with proceeds reinvested at lower yields. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher returns compared to low yields in Japan and the U.S.
We took a larger-than-normal impairment in the quarter involving our investment in Navient Corp. Navient is a publicly traded student loan administrator, formally part of Sallie Mae. While we don't believe there are any near-term risk of default, the majority of these holdings are long-dated and yen-denominated with poor liquidity. As a result, these holdings trade at a deep discount. At roughly $0.50 on the dollar, we felt it prudent to take impairment.
Note that the majority of these securities are held in our Japan portfolio and are rated below investment grade. As a result, any decline in value has been reflected for Japan SMR purposes for several quarters. The impairment has no material impact on our overall capital position and deployment plans.
Turning to capital. We expect SMR and RBC ratios to remain strong. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and expect to fulfill our guidance of $1.3 billion in repurchases for the year. Our dividend increase is in line with our expectation for full year 2015 operating earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of currency. I would note that despite continuing weakness in the yen, our excess capital position and stable view of capital generation supports the increase.
Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance. Our fourth quarter guidance simply solves for our full year 2015 EPS guidance range of $5.96 a share to $6.16 a share given our year-to-date results.
As we look to the fourth quarter and proceed through our financial planning process, we see the following dynamics influencing our performance. Recognizing the effect of our past reinsurance transactions in Japan, we see earned premium in Japan and the U.S. increasing in the low single-digit range with stable persistency. We see core Japan and U.S. benefit ratios holding strong around current levels after normalizing for the Japan IBNR reduction in the quarter. The maturity of high-yielding investments reinvested at lower new money rates will continue to pressure net investment income although modestly offset by a strategic asset allocation and recognizing a bias towards higher quality. The growth we are experiencing in Japan required disciplined investment in customer care, product and distribution expansion. We see the same dynamic evolving in the U.S. in order to drive more robust growth rates.
Our strong capital position and deployment efforts will continue to provide support for EPS growth. Our capital generation is strong, and we continue to explore the potential to release additional excess capital. Absent attractive alternatives, we expect to drive long-term value in repurchasing our stock.
These dynamics are generally consistent with our performance in 2015, and we look forward to providing more details on our December 3 outlook call.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Robin to begin Q&A."

[Foreign Language] Well, in terms of the business alliance with the JP that he has referred to, this is something very specific to Japan. As you know, Japan is an aging society, [Foreign Language] and the families are becoming more neutralized. Foreign Language] So what the FSA or the society, overall, is really demanding of an insurance company is that we need to check up on whether the policyholders, these older policyholders, are still alive or not. [Foreign Language] And since, as you know, Japan Post has its mail delivery network across Japan, what we like to do is to use their network to check up on our policyholders. [Foreign Language] And if we try to do everything on our own within Aflac, it is going to require a lot of work. However, with the cooperation with JP, we will be able to achieve the same purpose in a relatively easier manner. [Foreign Language] And one other point, this is probably more specific to Japan as well, is that for any notice that needs to sell from an insurance company to policyholder has to be done by mail. [Foreign Language] However, when the policyholder changes their addresses, we will not know the new address until our policyholders tells us so. [Foreign Language] So in overall, it will lead to increasing the services to our customers because the JP, the post offices will know that our customer's address has changed because they are delivering the postal mails to them, and that would make it easier for us to know where the policyholders are. [Foreign Language] We do believe this is a great alliance because we are using the strength, and while the JP does its -- does best in their way and we are making leverage out of what JP is doing, and that will also benefit us and serve our policyholders as well. That's it for me."

So where my comments were coming from, first, the adjustment in the quarter. Let's make sure we understand that. So this was an adjustment to the IBNR reserves related to our cancer business in Japan, and more specifically, it was related to a subset of our IBNR that relates to what we characterize as tail-related claims. So these would be longer-duration claims or estimate of claims emerging typically longer than 3 years out. It's a relatively small portion of the total IBNR that we hold for cancer, but it's one that periodically, as in at least once a year, we do a more thorough examination of in test based on the trends we've been seeing in recent years. And so as you can see, our trends have been very good on the overall claims front. And so when we put these reserves, these particular tail reserves, under review, we comfortably determined that there was margin in those reserves, and we should take them down. So that's the JPY 4.2 billion reduction that I referenced and then, I'm asking you to pull out, if you will, to think about the benefit ratios going forward. So my comments on the stability of benefit ratios is to first recognize that we have multiple businesses, as you know, in Japan that have different benefit ratios and different benefit ratio and claims trends. But overall, when we pile them all together and look at the overall Japan benefit ratio dynamic, we expect stability, but stability in third sector, particularly as you pull out that IBNR in the cancer side."

I think, first of all, we have a relatively wide margin, EPS margin for the fourth quarter, and that's really the result of 2 things: one, somewhat solving for the full year guidance range, which creates a larger fourth quarter range; the second is, of course, we have a range naturally based on our assumption for what yen may do. We think in terms of the range being dictated by yen between JPY 120 and JPY 125, so that creates a wider range. But part of the reason we want to walk you through a couple of the normalizing items in the quarter was so that you can really roll forward our results in a fairly consistent way. So at the moment, our expectation is for stability and the key earnings drivers as we roll forward, and we would leave it at that. And so don't expect. At this point in time, I don't know enough to know what I would characterize as onetimers. The only comment I made is that we do, do more thorough actuarial reviews in the third and fourth quarter.

But first, we monitor the sale of these products, first sector products, very carefully because the returns on those products can be very sensitive to the interest rate environment as you point out but also your investment strategy backing these products. And so even though the interest rate environment is very low, it's always possible that our investment strategies -- and you've seen recently that, particularly in the end the third quarter, we've been able to defend our new money rates and put money to work at relatively attractive levels, albeit headwinds are definitely in the marketplace. And so they're very sensitive to that type of investment strategy. But more importantly, we've really made moves to really focus the type of product that we're selling to deemphasize lump sum premium or so-called dump in premium type product and also product that is sold particularly in the bank channel where it's more of a spreadsheet-ed environment in a competitive landscape. Those things, coupled with the interest rate in the investment market, can make for volatile returns or challenging returns, and so we want to deemphasize that. Where we're emphasizing is the longer pay products, which gives us more possibility of putting money to work at attractive levels. It also tends to attract more of a protection orientation versus investment orientation. And most importantly, it's being driven through the traditional channels, which support cross-sell activity and again, recognizing, once you're in the cross-sell activity, you're trying to look at the overall blended return on a household, which includes the returns on these products plus third sector products. So we're monitoring it very carefully. You're absolutely right, there was a rise in our sales, but it's largely coming through the traditional channel, largely coming through the longer pay premium products and involving cross-sell.
So Paul, you can maybe expand or add?"

One thing I would comment on, Ryan, just in this quarter to be mindful of from a math perspective, as I mentioned, the premium collection of reduction in the allowance for uncollectible premium, obviously, realize that, that pumps up the numerator, if you will. And so that helps benefit the -- optically benefits both your benefit ratio and your expense ratio because your premium is pumped up a little bit when you make that adjustment.

Certainly, as you watched JGBs grind down, that doesn't make a job any easier in terms of generating yield but realize we've got a portfolio approach to backing these products, which includes, among other things, the dollar program, Eric's strategic asset allocation. And so we take somewhat of a blended strategic asset allocation portfolio yield approach, if you will, to the expected investment horizons. So for example, recently, we've seen treasuries and JGBs go down, but spreads widen out to where new money could be put the work, actually, at even net more attractive levels, as long as you're being careful in where you go with the money. So it's not quite as simple as pegging to a JGB. But certainly, as you JGB goes -- going down, you got to keep in mind 2 things. One, obviously, more of a challenge to reinvest that money; but the other is, as you're having to gradually move towards lower assumptions for ongoing interest rates as it relates to pricing of the product and so you end up having a gradually less competitive product in the marketplace, this is really an industry thing, not an Aflac issue. And so is there -- do you reach a point where it's just not as much a value proposition for the client as you'd hope and as the overall market start to get soft. So I think those are some of the dynamics, but it's not a 1 for 1 tied to JGB. It's not quite that simple, although, directionally, certainly, it doesn't help. Hey, one other thing I would say on third sector and some of the commentary around Japan Post. I mean, be mindful of the difference between growth rates and just having a much larger engine now as we start January 1 versus January 1 of last year. I mean, the fact of the matter is we're just selling a more volume of product even though the comparables may be challenging. We have a net larger distribution engine that's driving simply more sales overall. So that growth rate really benefits you as you move forward and look particularly at premium growth rates and your in-force growth rates and the overall economic value that you've driven. So there'll continue to be growth in my view in terms of value even though you may occasionally look at comparables, comparable sales periods that don't look as attractive, particularly when you know the dynamic with this is, is that it jumped out at a very strong level, which is not unusual when you build up all the advertising and marketing investments to really launch it. And that was the story in the fourth quarter of last year."

One, the actual consolidated return on what we have provided to that household to your point. But the other is what value you see in that household and that agent relationship going forward as you continue to develop new product to sell to your existing block of business and clients and new clients. The other thing to consider is that you have agents making a living off of the building out of these households and the sale or potential sale of new product. And so it supports the growth of your agency force and stability and even retention and development of your agency force. And these are things that are difficult to put economics behind, but we all know they drive embedded value. So that's where I come from when I use the term household is the support for the agency, the agency build-out, the ability to do cross-sell and what might be the future -- present value future sales dynamics related to having developed more households. One of the things we tend to lead with in Japan is that we're in 1 of 4 households. And when you start the conversation with that, that suggests there to be a lot of opportunity you can develop by simply being in that position, and so it really benefits us."

Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.

250178,281476102,884515,"AFLAC Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Robin. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third",740,"Yes. Thank you, Robin. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third quarter and 27.1% year-to-date. Aflac Japan generated strong sales results from all of our sales channels, which confirms that we've focused on the right facets of our business.
We also continue to work closely with Japan Post to enhance our partnership, as demonstrated by the recently announced initiative to foster enhanced communications with the growing elderly population in Japan. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions, and our quarterly and year-to-date results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.
I want to remind you that Aflac Japan's 2014 fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. However, given the very strong sales results in the first 9 months and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are upwardly revising our sales growth target for the third sector products from the range of 7% to 10% to 10% to 13% for the full year.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. also performed very well in the quarter. Additionally, we have continued to receive phenomenal feedback from our distribution channels, our policyholders and accounts on One Day Pay, our industry-leading claims initiative. One Day Pay allows us to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just 1 day. In particular, we're hearing from policyholders and consumers that our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment delivering on our promise, thus enhancing our brand reputation and ultimately opening even more doors for Aflac.
We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect the number of claims processed within the One Day Pay will reach over 2 million people. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to drive home the value of Aflac's products and most importantly, it will help our sales long term.
Although our U.S. segments generated a slight increase in sales, I believe 2015 has been a year of building our business through our career and broker channels. Taking into account our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for sales for the quarter, we anticipate Aflac U.S. will generate sales growth at the lower end of the 3% to 7% range for the year.
While it's been a year of building, I'm not satisfied with these results. In fact, I won't be satisfied until we see our sales growth more in the range of the mid-single digits, which I believe is reasonable and achievable.
It is very difficult for us to make sales projections for the quarter or even for the year because around half of our sales will come in the last 5 weeks of the year. But I can tell you that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure over the last year are laying the groundwork for better long-term sales per se [ph]. And we continue to invest in our platform to position us for growth. As we look to 2016, I think the groundwork we laid in 2015 has put us in a better position for 2016.
Shortly, Fred will comment on the financial and capital deployment, but let me just say that I'm pleased with the actions by the Board of Directors to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 5.1%. This marks the 33rd consecutive year of increasing cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
Let me leave you with this thought. You've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year, just as we have in the past. And I believe that we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promise to our policyholders and returning significant capital to our owners.
Now I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quart",865,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quarter.
Our third quarter results came in at the high end of our earnings guidance. Along with solid overall results, there are 2 earnings items that contributed to our better-than-expected performance. The first item was in Japan where we continue to see overall favorable claims trends. While we review our IBNR every quarter, we take a more comprehensive annual look at trends and claims studies in the third and fourth quarter. Reflecting on our favorable claims experience this year and as a result of this review, we concluded it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.2 billion or roughly $35 million before taxes. We have not completed our year-end actuarial reviews, but at this point, we do not see or anticipate any material fourth quarter adjustments.
The second driver was in our U.S. business where we have been steadily improving our customer billing and collection procedures. These improvements have resulted in better collection experience and allowed us to refine our uncollected premium allowance estimate. The catch-up portion of this adjustment helped improve our rate of earned premium growth in the quarter and contributed approximately $8 million to pretax earnings.
While these items contributed approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the quarter's results, overall, our Japan and U.S. operations enjoyed solid margins with adjusted benefit ratios favorable to our expectations and as compared with last year's quarter. As we expected, expense ratios were modestly elevated as we continue to invest in our platforms to generate growth, namely IT and new product introduction in Japan and our distribution model in the U.S.
Turning to investments. While we have been successful in defending net investment income, the overall low-rate environment remains a clear headwind and shows no signs of abating. We have natural maturities and higher-coupon investments that are running off with proceeds reinvested at lower yields. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher returns compared to low yields in Japan and the U.S.
We took a larger-than-normal impairment in the quarter involving our investment in Navient Corp. Navient is a publicly traded student loan administrator, formerly part of Sallie Mae. While we don't believe there are any near-term risk of default, the majority of these holdings are long-dated and yen-denominated with poor liquidity. As a result, these holdings trade at a deep discount. At roughly $0.50 on the dollar, we felt it prudent to take impairment.
Note that the majority of these securities are held in our Japan portfolio and are rated below investment grade. As a result, any decline in value has been reflected for Japan SMR purposes for several quarters. The impairment has no material impact on our overall capital position and deployment plans.
Turning to capital. We expect SMR and RBC ratios to remain strong. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and expect to fulfill our guidance of $1.3 billion in repurchases for the year. Our dividend increase is in line with our expectation for full year 2015 operating earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of currency. I would note that despite continuing weakness in the yen, our excess capital position and stable view of capital generation supports the increase.
Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance. Our fourth quarter guidance simply solves for our full year 2015 EPS guidance range of $5.96 a share to $6.16 a share given our year-to-date results.
As we look to the fourth quarter and proceed through our financial planning process, we see the following dynamics influencing our performance. Recognizing the effect of our past reinsurance transactions in Japan, we see earned premium in Japan and the U.S. increasing in the low single-digit range with stable persistency. We see core Japan and U.S. benefit ratios holding strong around current levels after normalizing for the Japan IBNR reduction in the quarter. The maturity of high-yielding investments reinvested at lower new money rates will continue to pressure net investment income, although modestly offset by our strategic asset allocation and recognizing a bias towards higher quality. The growth we are experiencing in Japan required disciplined investment in customer care, product and distribution expansion. We see the same dynamic evolving in the U.S. in order to drive more robust growth rates.
Our strong capital position and deployment efforts will continue to provide support for EPS growth. Our capital generation is strong, and we continue to explore the potential to release additional excess capital. Absent attractive alternatives, we expect to drive long-term value in repurchasing our stock.
These dynamics are generally consistent with our performance in 2015, and we look forward to providing more details on our December 3 outlook call.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Robin to begin Q&A."

[Foreign Language] Well, in terms of the business alliance with the JP that he has referred to, this is something very specific to Japan. As you know, Japan is an aging society, [Foreign Language] and the families are becoming more nuclearized. [Foreign Language] So what the FSA or the society, overall, is really demanding of an insurance company is that we need to check up on whether the policyholders, these older policyholders, are still alive or not. [Foreign Language] And since, as you know, Japan Post has its mail delivery network across Japan, what we like to do is to use their network to check up on our policyholders. [Foreign Language] And if we try to do everything on our own within Aflac, it is going to require a lot of work. However, with the cooperation with JP, we will be able to achieve the same purpose in a relatively easier manner. [Foreign Language] And one other point, this is probably more specific to Japan as well, is that for any notice that needs to be sent from an insurance company to policyholder has to be done by mail. [Foreign Language] However, when the policyholder changes their addresses, we will not know the new address until our policyholders tells us so. [Foreign Language] So in overall, it will lead to increasing the services to our customers because the JP, the post offices will know that our customer's address has changed because they are delivering the postal mails to them, and that will make it easier for us to know where the policyholders are. [Foreign Language] We do believe this is a great alliance because we are using the strength and what the JP does its -- does best in their way, and we are making leverage out of what JP is doing, and that will also benefit us and serve our policyholders as well. That's it for me."

So where my comments were coming from, first, the adjustment in the quarter. Let's make sure we understand that. So this was an adjustment to IBNR reserves related to our cancer business in Japan, and more specifically, it was related to a subset of our IBNR that relates to what we characterize as tail-related claims. So these would be longer-duration claims or estimate of claims emerging typically longer than 3 years out. It's a relatively small portion of the total IBNR that we hold for cancer, but it's one that periodically, as in at least once a year, we do a more thorough examination of and test based on the trends we've been seeing in recent years. And so as you can see, our trends have been very good on the overall claims front. And so when we put these reserves, these particular tail reserves, under review, we comfortably determined that there was margin in those reserves, and we should take them down. So that's the JPY 4.2 billion reduction that I referenced and that I'm asking you to pull out, if you will, to think about the benefit ratios going forward. So my comments on the stability of benefit ratios is to first recognize that we have multiple businesses, as you know, in Japan that have different benefit ratios and different benefit ratio and claims trends. But overall, when we pile them all together and look at the overall Japan benefit ratio dynamic, we expect stability, but stability in third sector, particularly as you pull out that IBNR in the cancer side."

But first, we monitor the sale of these products, first sector products, very carefully because the returns on those products can be very sensitive to the interest rate environment as you point out but also your investment strategy backing these products. And so even though the interest rate environment is very low, it's always possible that our investment strategies -- and you've seen recently that, particularly in the third quarter, we've been able to defend our new money rates and put money to work at relatively attractive levels, albeit headwinds are definitely in the marketplace. And so they're very sensitive to that type of investment strategy. But more importantly, we've really made moves to really focus the type of product that we're selling to deemphasize lump sum premium or so-called dump in premium type product and also product that is sold particularly in the bank channel where it's more of a spreadsheet-ed environment and a competitive landscape. Those things, coupled with the interest rate and investment market, can make for volatile returns or challenging returns, and so we want to deemphasize that. Where we're emphasizing is the longer pay products, which gives us more possibility of putting money to work at attractive levels. It also tends to attract more of a protection orientation versus an investment orientation. And most importantly, it's being driven through the traditional channels, which support cross-sell activity and again, recognizing once you're into cross-sell activity, you're trying to look at the overall blended return on a household, which includes the returns on these products plus third sector products. So we're monitoring it very carefully. You're absolutely right, there was a rise in our sales, but it's largely coming through the traditional channel, largely coming through longer pay premium products and involving cross-sell.
So Paul, you can maybe expand or add?"

But we see it as being a relatively stable outlook, and nothing really notable in the patterns. Yes. One thing I would comment on, Ryan, just in this quarter to be mindful of from a math perspective, as I mentioned, the premium collection -- reduction in the allowance for uncollectible premium, obviously, realize that, that pumps up the numerator, if you will. And so that helps benefit the -- optically it benefits both your benefit ratio and your expense ratio because your premium is pumped up a little bit when you make that adjustment. So be mindful of that this quarter. If there is -- there's actually a really, really slight amount of normalization that you want to do on benefit ratios, but it's actually not related to claims.

Certainly, as you watch JGBs grind down, that doesn't make the job any easier in terms of generating yield, but realize we've got a portfolio approach to backing these products, which includes, among other things, the dollar program, Eric's strategic asset allocation. And so we take somewhat of a blended strategic asset allocation portfolio yield approach, if you will, to the expected investment horizons. So for example, recently, we've seen treasuries and JGBs go down, but spreads widen out to where new money could be put to work, actually, at even net more attractive levels, as long as you're being careful in where you go with the money. So it's not quite as simple as pegging to a JGB. But certainly, as you JGB goes -- going down, you got to keep in mind 2 things: One, obviously, more of a challenge to reinvest that money; but the other is, as you're having to gradually move towards lower assumptions for ongoing interest rates as it relates to pricing of the product and so you end up having a gradually less competitive product in the marketplace. This is really an industry thing, not an Aflac issue. And so is there -- do you reach a point where it's just not as much a value proposition for the client as you'd hoped and does the overall market start to get soft. So I think those are some of the dynamics, but it's not a 1 for 1 tied to JGB. It's not quite that simple, although, directionally, certainly, it doesn't help. Hey, one other thing I would say on third sector and some of the commentary around Japan Post. I mean, be mindful of the difference between growth rates and just having a much larger engine now as we start January 1 versus January 1 of last year. I mean, the fact of the matter is we're just selling a more volume of product even though the comparables may be challenging. We have a net larger distribution engine that's driving simply more sales overall. So that growth rate really benefits you as you move forward and look particularly at premium growth rates and your in-force growth rates and the overall economic value that you've driven. So there'll continue to be growth in my view in terms of value even though you may occasionally look at comparables, comparable sales periods that don't look as attractive, particularly when you know the dynamic with this is that it jumped out at a very strong level, which is not unusual when you build up all the advertising and marketing investment to really launch it. And that was the story in the fourth quarter of last year."

But if you were to adjust both the benefit ratios, so adjust the Japan benefit ratio for the IBNR adjustment and adjust the U.S. benefit ratio, really, just modestly for the premium kick-up related to the premium collection allowance, we're seeing relative stability in those margins, certainly, as we enter into the fourth quarter. As we get into 2016, we don't see things at the moment that would disrupt that. Realize that the mix of business can play a little bit with your benefit ratios, and so we'd want to -- we want to understand the mix of business in Japan, particularly third sector versus first sector, and we want to understand some of the mix of business dynamics in the U.S. a little bit better. But we're not seeing things that suggest to us significant movement in those benefit ratios going forward. So we'll provide a little more color on this in the outlook call. I would also note that expense ratios, obviously, in the recent year, have been slightly more elevated as we reinvest back in our platforms. I mentioned that in my comment.

But the other is what value you see in that household and that agent relationship going forward as you continue to develop new product to sell to your existing block of business and clients and new clients. The other thing to consider is that you have agents making a living off of the building out of these households and the sale or potential sale of new product. And so it supports the growth of your agency force and stability and even retention and development of your agency force. And these are things that are difficult to put economics behind, but we all know they drive embedded value. So that's where I come from when I use the term household is the support for the agency, the agency build-out, the ability to cross-sell and what might be the future -- present value future sales dynamics related to having developed more households. One of the things we tend to lead with in Japan is that we're in 1 of 4 households. And when you start the conversation with that, that suggests there to be a lot of opportunity you can develop by simply being in that position, and so it really benefits us."

And good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third",740,"Yes. Thank you, Robin. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third quarter and 27.1% year-to-date. Aflac Japan generated strong sales results from all of our sales channels, which confirms that we've focused on the right facets of our business.
We also continue to work closely with Japan Post to enhance our partnership, as demonstrated by the recently announced initiative to foster enhanced communications with the growing elderly population in Japan. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions, and our quarterly and year-to-date results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.
I want to remind you that Aflac Japan's 2014 fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. However, given the very strong sales results in the first 9 months and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are upwardly revising our sales growth target for the third sector products from the range of 7% to 10% to 10% to 13% for the full year.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. also performed very well in the quarter. Additionally, we have continued to receive phenomenal feedback from our distribution channels, our policyholders and accounts on One Day Pay, our industry-leading claims initiative. One Day Pay allows us to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just 1 day. In particular, we're hearing from policyholders and consumers that our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment delivering on our promise, thus enhancing our brand reputation and ultimately opening even more doors for Aflac.
We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect the number of claims processed within the One Day Pay will reach over 2 million people. Along with a strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to drive home the value of Aflac's products and most importantly, it will help our sales long term.
Although our U.S. segments generated a slight increase in sales, I believe 2015 has been a year of building our business through our career and broker channels. Taking into account our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for sales for the quarter, we anticipate Aflac U.S. will generate sales growth at the lower end of the 3% to 7% range for the year.
While it's been a year of building, I'm not satisfied with these results. In fact, I won't be satisfied until we see our sales growth more in the range of the mid-single digits, which I believe is reasonable and achievable.
It is very difficult for us to make sales projections for the quarter or even for the year because around half of our sales will come in the last 5 weeks of the year. But I can tell you that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure over the last year are laying the groundwork for better long-term sales per se [ph]. And we continue to invest in our platform to position us for growth. As we look to 2016, I think the groundwork we laid in 2015 has put us in a better position for 2016.
Shortly, Fred will comment on the financial and capital deployment, but let me just say that I'm pleased with the actions by the Board of Directors to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 5.1%. This marks the 33rd consecutive year of increasing cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
Let me leave you with this thought. You've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year, just as we have in the past. And I believe that we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promise to our policyholders and returning significant capital to our owners.
Now I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quart",865,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, added color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quarter.
Our third quarter results came in at the high end of our earnings guidance. Along with solid overall results, there are 2 earnings items that contributed to our better-than-expected performance. The first item was in Japan where we continue to see overall favorable claims trends. While we review our IBNR every quarter, we take a more comprehensive annual look at trends and claims studies in the third and fourth quarter. Reflecting on our favorable claims experience this year and as a result of this review, we concluded it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.2 billion or roughly $35 million before taxes. We have not completed our year-end actuarial reviews, but at this point, we do not see or anticipate any material fourth quarter adjustments.
The second driver was in our U.S. business where we have been steadily improving our customer billing and collection procedures. These improvements have resulted in better collection experience and allowed us to refine our uncollected premium allowance estimate. The catch-up portion of this adjustment helped improve our rate of earned premium growth in the quarter and contributed approximately $8 million to pretax earnings.
While these items contributed approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the quarter's results, overall, our Japan and U.S. operations enjoyed solid margins with adjusted benefit ratios favorable to our expectations and as compared with last year's quarter. As we expected, expense ratios were modestly elevated as we continue to invest in our platforms to generate growth, namely IT and new product introduction in Japan and our distribution model in the U.S.
Turning to investments. While we have been successful in defending net investment income, the overall low-rate environment remains a clear headwind and shows no signs of abating. We have natural maturities and higher-coupon investments that are running off with proceeds reinvested at lower yields. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher returns compared to low yields in Japan and the U.S.
We took a larger-than-normal impairment in the quarter involving our investment in Navient Corp. Navient is a publicly traded student loan administrator, formerly part of Sallie Mae. While we don't believe there are any near-term risk of default, the majority of these holdings are long-dated and yen-denominated with poor liquidity. As a result, these holdings trade at a deep discount. At roughly $0.50 on the dollar, we felt it prudent to take impairment.
Note that the majority of these securities are held in our Japan portfolio and are rated below investment grade. As a result, any decline in value has been reflected for Japan SMR purposes for several quarters. The impairment has no material impact on our overall capital position and deployment plans.
Turning to capital. We expect SMR and RBC ratios to remain strong. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and expect to fulfill our guidance of $1.3 billion in repurchases for the year. Our dividend increase is in line with our expectation for full year 2015 operating earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of currency. I would note that despite continuing weakness in the yen, our excess capital position and stable view of capital generation supports the increase.
Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance. Our fourth quarter guidance simply solves for our full year 2015 EPS guidance range of $5.96 a share to $6.16 a share given our year-to-date results.
As we look to the fourth quarter and proceed through our financial planning process, we see the following dynamics influencing our performance. Recognizing the effect of our past reinsurance transactions in Japan, we see earned premium in Japan and the U.S. increasing in the low single-digit range with stable persistency. We see core Japan and U.S. benefit ratios holding strong around current levels after normalizing for the Japan IBNR reduction in the quarter. The maturity of high-yielding investments reinvested at lower new money rates will continue to pressure net investment income, although modestly offset by our strategic asset allocation and recognizing a bias towards higher quality. The growth we are experiencing in Japan required disciplined investment in customer care, product and distribution expansion. We see the same dynamic evolving in the U.S. in order to drive more robust growth rates.
Our strong capital position and deployment efforts will continue to provide support for EPS growth. Our capital generation is strong, and we continue to explore the potential to release additional excess capital. Absent attractive alternatives, we expect to drive long-term value in repurchasing our stock.
These dynamics are generally consistent with our performance in 2015, and we look forward to providing more details on our December 3 outlook call.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Robin to begin Q&A."

[Foreign Language] Well, in terms of the business alliance with the JP that he has referred to, this is something very specific to Japan. As you know, Japan is an aging society, [Foreign Language] and the families are becoming more nuclearized. [Foreign Language] So what the FSA or the society, overall, is really demanding of an insurance company is that we need to check up on whether the policyholders, these older policyholders, are still alive or not. [Foreign Language] And since, as you know, Japan Post has its mail delivery network across Japan, what we like to do is to use their network to check up on our policyholders. [Foreign Language] And if we try to do everything on our own within Aflac, it is going to require a lot of work. However, with the cooperation with JP, we will be able to achieve the same purpose in a relatively easier manner. [Foreign Language] And one other point, this is probably more specific to Japan as well, is that for any notice that needs to be sent from an insurance company to policyholder has to be done by mail. [Foreign Language] However, when the policyholder changes their addresses, we will not know the new address until our policyholders tells us so. [Foreign Language] So in overall, it will lead to increasing the services to our customers because the JP, the post offices will know that our customer's address has changed because they are delivering the postal mails to them, and that will make it easier for us to know where the policyholders are. [Foreign Language] We do believe this is a great alliance because we are using the strength and what the JP does its -- does best in their way, and we are making leverage out of what JP is doing, and that will also benefit us and serve our policyholders as well. That's it for me."

So where my comments were coming from, first, the adjustment in the quarter. Let's make sure we understand that. So this was an adjustment to IBNR reserves related to our cancer business in Japan, and more specifically, it was related to a subset of our IBNR that relates to what we characterize as tail-related claims. So these would be longer-duration claims or estimate of claims emerging typically longer than 3 years out. It's a relatively small portion of the total IBNR that we hold for cancer, but it's one that periodically, as in at least once a year, we do a more thorough examination of and test based on the trends we've been seeing in recent years. And so as you can see, our trends have been very good on the overall claims front. And so when we put these reserves, these particular tail reserves, under review, we comfortably determined that there was margin in those reserves, and we should take them down. So that's the JPY 4.2 billion reduction that I referenced and that I'm asking you to pull out, if you will, to think about the benefit ratios going forward. So my comments on the stability of benefit ratios is to first recognize that we have multiple businesses, as you know, in Japan that have different benefit ratios and different benefit ratio and claims trends. But overall, when we pile them all together and look at the overall Japan benefit ratio dynamic, we expect stability, but stability in third sector, particularly as you pull out that IBNR in the cancer side."

I think, first of all, we have a relatively wide margin, EPS margin for the fourth quarter, and that's really the result of 2 things: one, somewhat solving for the full year guidance range, which creates a larger fourth quarter range; the second is, of course, we have a range naturally based on our assumption for what the yen may do. We think in terms of the range being dictated by yen between JPY 120 and JPY 125, so that creates a wider range. But part of the reason we wanted to walk you through a couple of the normalizing items in the quarter was so that you could really roll forward our results in a fairly consistent way.

But more importantly, we've really made moves to really focus the type of product that we're selling to deemphasize lump sum premium or so-called dump in premium type product and also product that is sold particularly in the bank channel where it's more of a spreadsheet-ed environment and a competitive landscape. Those things, coupled with the interest rate and investment market, can make for volatile returns or challenging returns, and so we want to deemphasize that. Where we're emphasizing is the longer pay products, which gives us more possibility of putting money to work at attractive levels. It also tends to attract more of a protection orientation versus an investment orientation. And most importantly, it's being driven through the traditional channels, which support cross-sell activity and again, recognizing once you're into cross-sell activity, you're trying to look at the overall blended return on a household, which includes the returns on these products plus third sector products. So we're monitoring it very carefully. You're absolutely right, there was a rise in our sales, but it's largely coming through the traditional channel, largely coming through longer pay premium products and involving cross-sell.
So Paul, you can maybe expand or add?"

But we see it as being a relatively stable outlook, and nothing really notable in the patterns. Yes. One thing I would comment on, Ryan, just in this quarter to be mindful of from a math perspective, as I mentioned, the premium collection -- reduction in the allowance for uncollectible premium, obviously, realize that, that pumps up the numerator, if you will. And so that helps benefit the -- optically it benefits both your benefit ratio and your expense ratio because your premium is pumped up a little bit when you make that adjustment. So be mindful of that this quarter. If there is -- there's actually a really, really slight amount of normalization that you want to do on benefit ratios, but it's actually not related to claims.

Certainly, as you watch JGBs grind down, that doesn't make the job any easier in terms of generating yield, but realize we've got a portfolio approach to backing these products, which includes, among other things, the dollar program, Eric's strategic asset allocation. And so we take somewhat of a blended strategic asset allocation portfolio yield approach, if you will, to the expected investment horizons. So for example, recently, we've seen treasuries and JGBs go down, but spreads widen out to where new money could be put to work, actually, at even net more attractive levels, as long as you're being careful in where you go with the money. So it's not quite as simple as pegging to a JGB. But certainly, as you JGB goes -- going down, you got to keep in mind 2 things: One, obviously, more of a challenge to reinvest that money; but the other is, as you're having to gradually move towards lower assumptions for ongoing interest rates as it relates to pricing of the product and so you end up having a gradually less competitive product in the marketplace. This is really an industry thing, not an Aflac issue. And so is there -- do you reach a point where it's just not as much a value proposition for the client as you'd hoped and does the overall market start to get soft. So I think those are some of the dynamics, but it's not a 1 for 1 tied to JGB. It's not quite that simple, although, directionally, certainly, it doesn't help. Hey, one other thing I would say on third sector and some of the commentary around Japan Post. I mean, be mindful of the difference between growth rates and just having a much larger engine now as we start January 1 versus January 1 of last year. I mean, the fact of the matter is we're just selling a more volume of product even though the comparables may be challenging. We have a net larger distribution engine that's driving simply more sales overall. So that growth rate really benefits you as you move forward and look particularly at premium growth rates and your in-force growth rates and the overall economic value that you've driven. So there'll continue to be growth in my view in terms of value even though you may occasionally look at comparables, comparable sales periods that don't look as attractive, particularly when you know the dynamic with this is that it jumped out at a very strong level, which is not unusual when you build up all the advertising and marketing investment to really launch it. And that was the story in the fourth quarter of last year."

We also see stability there, too, meaning we see a need to continue to reinvest in our platform to support the kind of growth you're seeing in Japan and to position ourselves for better growth in the U.S. So that stability comment I made..."

Right now, our investment has been oriented around -- in the U.S. has been oriented around what you know, and that is the investment we've made to reconfigure the sales platform and drive better growth. We're going to have to look at the same sorts of things in the U.S. that we've been successful in achieving in Japan, and that is keeping pace with the modernization and digitizing of our platform in the U.S. And those involve incremental investment. We have been making some of those investments along the way, so it doesn't necessarily suggest big deltas and things like expense ratios and so forth because we have been investing. But the pace of that investment is going to have to react to the market opportunity, and that's how we will approach it. When we see there's opportunity to go after that requires a level of investment and argues for our capital, then we'll want to do that for our shareholders. And that's the type of color, and we'll give you more context for that when we get to the outlook call."

I believe you used the term household. And where I'm going with this is I would've thought that given the sizable premium differential between WAYS and third sector products that to neutralize for the impact of the margin differential, you'd need to sell more than just 1 for 1. You'd probably need to sell 3, 4 third sector products to neutralize the lower margin from the first sector. So I just want to -- the question, I guess, is am I thinking about that correctly?"

But the other is what value you see in that household and that agent relationship going forward as you continue to develop new product to sell to your existing block of business and clients and new clients. The other thing to consider is that you have agents making a living off of the building out of these households and the sale or potential sale of new product. And so it supports the growth of your agency force and stability and even retention and development of your agency force. And these are things that are difficult to put economics behind, but we all know they drive embedded value. So that's where I come from when I use the term household is the support for the agency, the agency build-out, the ability to cross-sell and what might be the future -- present value future sales dynamics related to having developed more households. One of the things we tend to lead with in Japan is that we're in 1 of 4 households. And when you start the conversation with that, that suggests there to be a lot of opportunity you can develop by simply being in that position, and so it really benefits us."
